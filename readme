<b>Data</b>
<br>
Original data are on <i>GitHub</i>, more precisely:
<ul>
<li><b>CoAID</b>: <a>https://github.com/cuilimeng/CoAID</a></li>
<li><b>FakeHealth</b>: <a>https://github.com/EnyanDai/FakeHealth</a></li>
<li><b>ReCOVery</b>: <a>https://github.com/apurvamulay/ReCOVery</a></li>
</ul>


Due to <i>Twitter</i> policy it is not possible to release data in disaggregate form.
<br>
Inside the folder `Data/data_w_feature` is possible to find the data with the points associated with each feature described in the article.

<br>
<br>

<b>Code</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Import</b>:
- Inside the script `Code/import_dataset.py` enter the proper `absolute_path` (the path from <i>C</i> to <i>Tesi</i>), then execute it.
<br>
After the execution, data are placed in `Data/data_row`.

<b>Pre-processing</b>
- Inside the script `Code/preprocessing_dataset.py` enter the proper `absolute_path`, then execute it.
<br>
After the execution, data are placed in `Data/data_cleaned`.

<b>Enrichment</b>
<br>
In order to obtain Twitter data it's necessary to make call to API <i>Twitter</i>:
- Enter the <i>Twitter</i> keys  inside `Code/data_enrichment/secret.json`.
- Inside the script `Code/twitter_enrichment.py` enter the proper `absolute_path`, then execute it.
After the execution, data are placed in `Data/data_twitter`.

<b>Feature extraction</b>
<br>
- Inside the script `Code/extraction.py` enter the proper `absolute_path`, then execute it.
After the execution, data are placed in `Data/data_w_feature`.

<b>Class evaluation</b>
<br>
- Inside the script `Code/feature_class_evaluation.py` enter the proper `absolute_path`, then execute it.

<b>Global evaluation</b>
<br>
- In order to obtain LIWC feature it's necessary enter the <i>Receptivity</i> keys inside `Code/data_enrichment/liwc_features.py`, set the value of `extract_liwc` to True (line 17) and then execute the script.
    - However, the previous it's not mandatory because inside `Data/data_w_feature` are already present data with these features.  
- Inside the script `Code/global_evaluation.py` enter the proper `absolute_path`, then execute it (results are placed in `Data/results`).
- Inside the script `Code/results.py` enter the proper `absolute_path`, then execute it.

<br>

<b>Some recommendations</b>
- Due to policy <i>Twitter</i> it's not possible make more than 180 API call per 15 minutes. Because of this the enrichment phase is pretty long.
- To execute the global evaluation It's recommended to use GPU, especially for Deep Learning models.
- If it's not necessary, in order to save a lot of time, it's recommended to use directly data placed inside the folder `Data/data_w_feature`.
