During most of April, the HR assistant sat on the floor and worked from her personal laptop. But with the COVID-19 shutdown extending into May, she and her boyfriend invested in a more comfortable setup.

They ordered a desk from Wayfair, an office chair from Amazon, ink for the printer and other home office staples. In total, they spent more than $600.

""It all added up quickly,"" Silva said. ""I had no idea it would cost this much.""

Silva is far from the only person scrambling to piece together a home office in the stay-at-home era, and setting one up from scratch isn't cheap.

In fact, most people (54%) didn't have a remote work setup before the government moved to curb nonessential gatherings, according to a survey conducted by YouGov in partnership with USA TODAY and LinkedIn. Meanwhile, 74% of professionals age 18 to 74 said they're now working from home.

While remote work cuts down on the cost of commuting, home offices come with other sets of expenses.

People who are used to endlessly charging their laptops and other devices at the corporate office are now facing higher household electricity bills. Then, there's the expense of office furniture and reliable Wi-Fi. You may even feel pushed to invest in a printer or extra monitors.

But do companies have to reimburse you for any of these?

""It's tricky,"" said Lara Shortz, a labor attorney at Michelman & Robinson. ""But it largely depends on the state you live in.""

Several states such as California, Illinois, Minnesota and South Dakota have laws that require some sort of reimbursement for necessary work-related expenses. That means companies are more likely to cover the cost of hardware that you need to fulfill your job, like a computer or laptop, Shortz said.

Upgrades to your home internet typically wouldn't qualify for reimbursement under state laws, Shortz added.

Nearly a third of those working from home (32%) have had their calls or video chats interrupted by Wi-Fi or technology challenges, the study with LinkedIn and YouGov found. Some people are paying for more internet bandwidth to overcome these issues.

Johanna Appel, an elementary school teacher in Long Island, New York, upgraded her home internet plan to accommodate an influx of Zoom calls with dozens of faculty members and students.

Her job provided her with a Chromebook laptop, though it wasn't powerful enough, she said. She spent nearly $2,000 on a Dell HP desktop, a set of headphones and a printer since the school closed its doors in mid-March.

""I had to do it for my sanity,"" Appel said. ""I think the money was worth being spent, but I don't think I'll get reimbursed at all.""

If you use part of your home for business, you may be able to deduct some of the expenses when you file your taxes. The IRS website says the home office deduction is available for both homeowners and renters.

Not everyone can afford a comfy work setup at home. Internet providers like AT&T and Comcast have offered incentives to ease the burden. And not everyone has space to fit a work desk. But experts have tips for using what you do have.

A quality pair of headphones is a simple way to help you focus on your tasks by reducing the noise you hear around you, according to Madeline Pratt, founder of the technology consulting agency Fearless in Training.

""With people having kids, dogs and partners at home, getting a really good headset situation is critical to be clear and focused on calls,"" Pratt said.

You don't necessarily need to buy a desk in order to look professional on Zoom calls, said LinkedIn career expert Blair Heitmann. Just ""avoid couches, beds and cozy chairs that put your posture in a more relaxed position,"" Heitmann said.

These days, coworkers are understanding when it comes to occasional interruptions from kids or pets. Still, finding a dedicated space to work that's free from unnecessary distractions is essential.

""Try to find a place that is set apart from the rest of your family with a door,"" Heitmann said. ""And be sure to communicate with your family when you need some alone time.""

Need a coronavirus escape? Here are 100 movies to watch for every cinematic yearning

Staying Apart, Together:A newsletter about how to cope with the coronavirus pandemic

‘Alien’

The always-evolving franchise mixing sci-fi and horror has kept things interesting since 1979, giving us a legendary heroine in Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in the early films and an all-time creature design in H.R. Giger’s Xenomorph.

Be sure to see: Ridley Scott’s original “Alien” and James Cameron’s 1986 “Aliens” are equally astounding, the former being a claustrophobic chiller in space and the latter an impressive action epic.

But feel free to skip: The “Alien vs. Predator” movies are atrocious, and 1997’s “Alien Resurrection” went some weird places with cloning Ripley.

‘Back to the Future’

You’d be hard-pressed to name a time-traveling series more influential or more referenced as Michael J. Fox’s trilogy of trips to 1955, 2015 (back when that was still the far-flung future) and 1885.

Be sure to see: The original is still the best, as Fox’s Marty McFly has to go to the past to make sure his parents fall in love – and deal with his mom (Lea Thompson) hitting on him.

But feel free to skip: There is definitely a case of gradually diminishing returns in the last two movies, though the wrap-up of the Western-flavored “Back to the Future III"" still works.

‘The Dark Knight’ trilogy

Beginning with “Batman Begins,” the series helmed by Christopher Nolan gave the iconic Caped Crusader grit and depth, an outstanding actor in Christian Bale, plus Heath Ledger’s all-time portrayal as the Joker.

Be sure to see: Ledger arrives in the second chapter, “The Dark Knight,” to lend madness and mayhem to a story ultimately about finding humanity amid pure chaos.

But feel free to skip: Even with a masked Tom Hardy as Bane, the concluding “Dark Knight Rises” is a letdown. (Though it’s “Citizen Kane” compared with George Clooney’s “Batman & Robin.”)

‘The Conjuring’

Horror history is chock full of memorable series (“Friday the 13th,” “Halloween”) and director James Wan’s freaky mythology based on the exploits of real-life paranormal investigators is a haven of recent fright fests.

Be sure to see: The two main “Conjuring” films (starring Patrick Warren and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren) are the primary culprits in doling out chills, especially the 2016 sequel with some serious “Exorcist” vibes.

But feel free to skip: The spinoffs have been a mixed bag, and the worst is “The Nun,” a 1950s-set prequel that completely wastes its demonic leading lady of the cloth.

‘Die Hard’

Bruce Willis’ John McClane was a breath of fresh air when he showed up in 1988, a relatable action hero who had all sorts of craziness thrown at him, only to get back up with a witty retort and gumption to spare.

Be sure to see: The original “Die Hard” is a towering action film that doubles as one of the best Christmas movies ever.

But feel free to skip: The other four installments are all over the place, though the low point is “A Good Day to Die Hard,” which rolled out Jai Courtney as McClane’s son.

‘Fast & Furious’

The muscle-bound action series has gifted us with nine testosterone-fueled extravaganzas, as Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his car-loving crew have gone from vehicle-jacking hoods to world-saving good guys.

Be sure to see: After four somewhat lackluster films, the “Furious” films really revved into gear with the addition of “franchise viagra” Dwayne Johnson in “Fast Five.”

But feel free to skip: Not counting Johnson’s spinoff “Hobbs & Shaw,” “2 Fast 2 Furious” is the only “Fast” movie without Diesel. And it shows.

‘The Godfather’ trilogy

Francis Ford Coppola’s sprawling family saga is the epitome of gangster flicks in Hollywood with a murderers row of acting talent (including Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino).

Be sure to see: The 1972 first film and 1974 sequel both won best picture, so, yeah, those are no-brainers.

But feel free to skip: “The Godfather III” is infamous as the weak link, although why risk having a horse head in your bed?

‘Harry Potter’

OK, sure, J.K. Rowling’s books are better. Still, it’s super-fun to witness Daniel Radcliffe grow up as a boy wizard in the span of eight movies and take on the slithery biggest bad this side of Darth Vader.

Be sure to see: “Prisoner of Azkaban,” Alfonso Cuaron’s 2004 third chapter, is dark, ultra-stylish and enjoyably weird as Harry meets the enigmatic Sirius Black (Gary Oldman).

But feel free to skip: The 2002 second movie “Chamber of Secrets” leans very kiddie compared to the rest.

‘How to Train Your Dragon’

Sorry “Toy Story” nerds, there’s no better animated series than the fantasy epic featuring a Viking boy and his scaly best friend.

Be sure to see: The 2010 first movie is a must-watch in terms of character relationships and the 2014 sequel is a world-building wonder.

But feel free to skip: They’re all pretty good, though last year’s third film lacks some of the others’ magic.

‘Indiana Jones'

Harrison Ford’s whip-cracking archaeologist has traveled the world, punched Nazis, saved antiquities and avoided having his face melted off – all for the greater good.

Be sure to see: “Raiders of the Lost Ark” introduced Henry Jones Jr. and is one of the best films ever made.

But feel free to skip: Second film “The Temple of Doom” features an utterly perfect, action-packed opening, so just stop after that and get out before things get bad.

James Bond collection

Coronavirus has delayed Daniel Craig’s 007 swan song, “No Time to Die,” to a fall release, which gives everyone extra time to catch up on the British superspy’s 26 previous efforts and various onscreen personas, from rough-and-tumble Sean Connery to uber-suave Pierce Brosnan.

Be sure to see: Each Bond has a standout, including Connery's ""Goldfinger,"" Roger Moore's ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" Timothy Dalton's ""Licence to Kill,"" Brosnan's ""GoldenEye"" and Craig's ""Skyfall.""

But feel free to skip: Brosnan's finale ""Die Another Day"" boasts Halle Berry, Madonna and loads of campy nonsense.

‘John Wick’

A favorite of dog lovers everywhere, Keanu Reeves’ well-dressed and retired title assassin is yanked back into a global underworld in a series with bonkers-good action sequences and so many memorable kills.

Be sure to see: The first film from 2014 is no slouch, yet 2017’s “Chapter 2” is one that really builds out the intriguing “Wick” mythology.

But feel free to skip: None of them. Reeves is a national treasure.

‘Jurassic Park’

So genetically engineering a bunch of dinosaurs in a theme park isn’t the greatest idea. You can’t deny the coolness of them romping and stomping yet again, in Steven Spielberg’s 1990s-era movies or the recent incarnations headed up by Chris Pratt.

Be sure to see: Spielberg’s original offers the visual spectacle of CGI dinos paired with a soaring John Williams score for a sense of childlike awe, with some definite high-stakes danger. (Thanks, T. rex.)

But feel free to skip: By the time the B-grade “Jurassic Park III” rolled through in 2001, the initial novelty – and Spielbergian wonder – was gone.

Kevin Smith’s View Askewniverse

Way before Marvel popularized the shared universe, 1994's New Jersey-set indie phenomenon “Clerks” wove together a group of oddball characters, with Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith) as the stoner Greek chorus connecting them all.

Be sure to see: While the black-and-white “Clerks” helped kick off a new generation of film, the 1997 romantic dramedy “Chasing Amy” with Ben Affleck and Joey Lauren Adams is Smith's most insightful picture.

But feel free to skip: Last year’s “Jay and Silent Bob Reboot” is a retread with familiar callbacks and cameos mainly for the hardcore Smith fans, albeit with the occasional winning bit of nuance.

‘The Lord of the Rings’ and ‘The Hobbit’

Peter Jackson’s adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth is a sight to behold, an epic quest first seen through the eyes of Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and then by his ""uncle"" Bilbo (Martin Freeman) in a prequel story.

Be sure to see: “The Return of the King” won best picture, closed out the “Rings” cycle and set a high bar for fantasy battles.

But feel to skip: The “Hobbit” trilogy is fine but doesn’t compare with its predecessor.

'Mad Max'

Australian director George Miller has been the master of populating post-apocalyptic wastelands with stoic heroes for decades, first with Mel Gibson for three movies (including 1979’s “Mad Max”) and more recently Tom Hardy in 2015’s “Mad Max: Fury Road.”

Be sure to watch: “Fury Road” is one of the best movies this century, a two-hour chase flick and blitzkrieg on the senses with a strongly female edge.

But feel free to skip: “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome” from 1985 is a more cheesetastic entry compared to the rest, though it did gift us Tina Turner with a crossbow.

Marvel Cinematic Universe

The “Infinity Saga” of 23 superhero movies, starting with 2008’s “Iron Man,” is a meticulously crafted story of origins and team-ups that will keep you powered through any lockdown.

Be sure to see: “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” is not just a capes-and-tights movie but a superb political thriller, and you can’t go wrong with any main “Avengers” film (except for “Age of Ultron”).

But feel free to skip: We won’t think ill of you moving past “Thor: The Dark World,” “The Incredible Hulk” and “Iron Man 2” for streamlining purposes.

‘Mission: Impossible’

Tom Cruise got his pop-culture resurgence starring in the films based on the old 1960s TV show, and he wears the role of action hero well, scooting around in speedy motorcycles and hanging off planes as superspy Ethan Hunt.

Be sure to see: The fourth installment “Ghost Protocol” has been the height so far of the six movies – and features Cruise doing his thing 1,700 feet off the ground in Dubai.

But feel free to skip: “Mission: Impossible 2” is all John Woo style and not much substance.

‘Rocky’ and ‘Creed’

Sylvester Stallone headlined the ultimate underdog tale of boxer Rocky Balboa, with championship ups and huge knockdowns aplenty, before passing the baton to Michael B. Jordan’s Adonis Creed and making it a generational saga.

Be sure to see: 1976's OG “Rocky” won best picture and is just a spectacular, rousing sports movie. But don’t sleep on the first “Creed,” which conjured a similar feeling nearly 40 years later.

But feel free to skip: “Rocky V” was the bad seed, giving Rocky brain damage to deal with as well as a hotheaded young pugilist (the late Tommy Morrison).

‘Star Wars’

Led up by the nine-movie Skywalker Saga, George Lucas’ galaxy far, far away of lightsaber-wielding warriors, megalomaniacal fascist villains, good-hearted rebels, cool bounty hunters and heroic princesses is just as awesome as you’ve heard.

Be sure to watch: The original trilogy is classic in its themes of good vs. evil and impressive in storytelling scope.

But feel free to skip: You won’t really miss anything too important by nixing “The Phantom Menace.”

“By the way, you know, when you say that we lead in cases, that’s because we have more testing than anybody else,” the president said at the White House. “When we have a lot of cases, I don’t look at that as a bad thing. I look at that in a certain respect as being a good thing, because it means our testing is much better. So, if we were testing a million people instead of 14 million people, it would have far few cases, right?

“So, I view it as a badge of honor. Really, it’s a badge of honor,” Trump said.

'This will kill you': People are warning others following Trump's apparent use of hydroxychloroquine

The U.S. has performed more than 12 million tests, according to the Covid Tracking Project. However, the country still faces testing shortages after months of hurdles in development and access.

At a Senate hearing last week, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said U.S. testing for coronavirus is “nothing to celebrate” because the country “treaded water” during the early stages of the pandemic while other countries such as South Korea tested people aggressively to curb the outbreak.

Romney said by March 6, the U.S. had conducted only 2,000 tests while South Korea had completed 140,000. Romney He said more aggressive testing was part of the reason why South Korea has had more success in fighting the virus.

South Korea has had 263 COVID-19 deaths, while the U.S. surpassed 92,000 Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

It took the U.S. until mid-April to pass South Korea in testing, which confirmed its first COVID-19 case on the same day, and until April 25 to surpass Finland.

'Unrivaled?' Fact-checking Donald Trump's claims about COVID-19 testing

Trump is correct when he says the U.S. has the most completed tests by any nation. However, that represents a single test for approximately 3.7% of the population.

The U.S. still trails many nations in per capita testing, including the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany.

Despite ramping up national testing in the U.S., health experts have raised concerns that not enough are being done for state's to safely reopen.

Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, told a congressional panel monitoring the federal response to the COVID-19 pandemic last week that, ""The U.S. needs more than 900,000 tests every day to safely open up again. We are doing about a third of that.""

Sarasota Herald-Tribune

SARASOTA, Fla. — Facing an explosive charge that his administration is manipulating coronavirus data to help make the case for reopening Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis played down the controversy Tuesday as a “nonissue.”

Florida’s COVID-19 death toll topped 2,000 Tuesday, underscoring the serious threat posed by the coronavirus and the potential consequences of not giving people accurate information on the risks involved.

Health experts say the milestone should serve as a sobering reminder to exercise caution as the state reopens, and DeSantis has presented his reopening plan as a “safe” and “step by step” approach. But the accusations levied by Rebekah Jones, a data expert at the Florida Department of Health, could undercut the governor’s reopening push.

Jones wrote in an email last week that she no longer was overseeing the state’s COVID-19 dashboard, which she built and managed for two months.

""As a word of caution, I would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency that I made central to the process during the first two months,” Jones wrote. “After all, my commitment to both is largely (arguably entirely) the reason I am no longer managing it.""

But DeSantis said at a Tuesday news conference that Jones sent an email to her supervisor saying the comments were being misinterpreted.

“I don’t know who she is but they gave me an email that she sent to her supervisor, said that, ‘Uh oh, I may have said something that was misrepresented,’” DeSantis said.

He added that Jones went on to write: “I said they’ve got a team working on it now and what I meant when I said don’t expect the same level of accessibility is that they are busy and can’t answer every single email they get right away and that it was ridiculous that I managed to do it in the first place and that I was tired and needed a break from working two months straight.""

Jones told Florida Today that she was fired on Monday. And she said in an email to the CBS12 television station in West Palm Beach that she faced blowback because she refused to ""manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.""

DeSantis spokeswoman Helen Aguirre Ferré, in a separate statement after the news conference, said Jones was fired for ""insubordination."" (Her complete statement is also at bottom.)

Jones ""exhibited a repeated course of insubordination during her time with the Department, including her unilateral decisions to modify the Department’s COVID-19 dashboard without input or approval from the epidemiological team or her supervisors,"" Ferré said.

""The blatant disrespect for the professionals who were working around the clock to provide the important information for the COVID-19 website was harmful to the team,"" she added. ""Accuracy and transparency are always indispensable, especially during an unprecedented public health emergency such as COVID-19.

""Having someone disruptive cannot be tolerated during this public pandemic, which led the Department to determine that it was best to terminate her employment.""

Asal M. Johnson, an assistant professor of Public Health at Stetson University, told Florida Today that she worried DOH is trying ""to undermine evidence-based decision making to prioritize (the) economy.""

Florida Democratic Party Chair Terrie Rizzo called for an independent investigation into the alleged data manipulation.

“Allegations that Florida’s government may have tried to manipulate or alter data to make reopening appear safer is outrageous,” Rizzo said. “These kinds of actions are dangerous and, frankly, should be criminal.”

Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, the only statewide elected Democrat, wrote a letter to DeSantis requesting that members of his administration appear at the state’s next Cabinet meeting to answer questions about the accusations levied by Jones.

“These actions undermine public trust in our government, are extraordinarily dangerous to public health, and are absolutely inconsistent with the transparency and accuracy that Floridians expect and deserve during this pandemic,” Fried wrote.

Meanwhile, the Florida Department of Health reported 55 more COVID-19 deaths Tuesday, bringing the statewide total to 2,052.

“In a rather short period of time we lost over 2,000 people in Florida to COVID-19, a disease we hadn’t even heard of before this year,” said Dr. Marissa Levine, a professor of public health and family medicine at the University of South Florida who leads the school’s Center for Leadership in Public Health Practice.

“As we work to reopen Florida it is critical for us all to remember that we each have a role in controlling this pandemic. Our individual and collective actions will determine the course of this pandemic in our own communities and will be the key as to whether we experience an even greater spike of disease and death in the coming months.”

Florida health officials reported the state’s first COVID-19 death on March 6, meaning it took 74 days to top 2,000 deaths.

The novel coronavirus has become one of the leading causes of death in Florida in just over two months. Based on 2018 death totals, 2,052 deaths would rank 16th among Florida’s top causes of death, above homicides and HIV.

Influenza and pneumonia killed 3,082 people in Florida in 2018. The coronavirus could top that this year.

Florida health officials are reporting a steady stream of new coronavirus cases, and more deaths are sure to follow.

The state’s coronavirus case total rose by 502 Tuesday to 46,944.

Floridians should be careful as they emerge from a month-long lockdown, said Levine, who previously served as Virginia’s state health commissioner.

“We know the virus is still circulating in our communities in Florida as well as around the nation and the globe,” Levine said. “Although we don’t have complete information, our best estimates tell us that many in our communities still remain vulnerable to the virus.

""Given Florida’s demographics and the burden of chronic disease in the population, many of us are at high risk of serious complications and even death.”

DeSantis began lifting Florida’s lockdown earlier this month. He has focused on the fact that the state’s health care system has not been overwhelmed, as some models predicted, and hospitals have plenty of available beds.

DeSantis touted his reopening strategy during a press conference in Orlando Monday. He has branded it the “Safe. Smart. Step by Step.” plan as he seeks to avoid criticism that he is moving too fast, something public health officials are warning against.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said during a U.S. Senate hearing last week that “the consequences could be really serious” if states reopen “prematurely.”

“I’m just looking forward to helping bring us back,” DeSantis said Monday. “Obviously we still have issues with public health; that’s not going to go away, but I think we have a pathway to get Florida moving again.”

DeSantis is pushing a phased reopening that accelerated this week when gyms, libraries and museums were allowed to welcome people at 50% capacity. Restaurants and other retail establishments were allowed to increase from 25% to 50% occupancy.

The governor also allowed barbershops and hair salons to reopen last week, and many municipalities have reopened beaches.

Public health experts worry that the number of new cases and deaths could spike if the state reopens and people don’t continue to practice social distancing and take other precautions.

“Our only tools to deal with this have remained the same: Physical distancing (including cloth face coverings) and aggressive hygienic practices,“ Levine said. ”Our ability to adapt and incorporate those practices into our everyday lives will determine the success of our reopening.

""I am hopeful that we will not interpret reopening as a return to the normal we once knew, but rather to a new normal that incorporates the adaptations we need to implement to protect one another.”

Rebekah Jones said in an email to the USA TODAY Network that she single-handedly created two applications in two languages, four dashboards, six unique maps with layers of data functionality for 32 variables covering a half a million lines of data. Her objective was to create a way for Floridians and researchers to see what the COVID-19 situation was in real time.

Then, she was dismissed.

""I worked on it alone, sixteen hours a day for two months, most of which I was never paid for, and now that this has happened I'll probably never get paid for,"" she wrote in an email, confirming that she had not just been reassigned on May 5, but fired from her job as Geographic Information Systems manager for the Florida Department of Health.

After USA TODAY Network first reported Jones' removal from her position in charge of the Florida COVID-19 Data and Surveillance Dashboard she created, she confirmed, as reported by CBS-12 in West Palm Beach that she was fired because she was ordered to censor some data, but refused to ""manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.""

She provided no further details.

In an email last Friday to researchers and other data users, Jones warned that with her removal changes were likely coming to the accessibility and transparency of the dashboard data.

""They are making a lot of changes. I would advise being diligent in your respective uses of this data,"" she wrote.

Researchers who saw the email reacted with shock and dismay, suggesting it could be evidence that the Gov. Ron De Santis' government was censoring information to support the case for re-opening Florida.

Lucky Tran, a Biologist and public health communicator at Columbia University, on Twitter reacted to the news in a series of tweets: ""When politicians censor scientists and manipulate the numbers, the rest of us suffer,"" he wrote.

US Congresswoman representing Tampa Bay, Kathy Castor wrote: ""Floridians will not feel safe in opening up without transparency.""

Governor Ron DeSantis' spokeswoman, Helen Aguirre Ferré, issued a statement to the Miami Herald, saying: “The Florida COVID-19 Dashboard was created by the Geographic Information System (GIS) team in the Division of Disease Control and Health Protection at the Florida Department of Health. Although Rebekah Jones is no longer involved, the GIS team continues to manage and update the Dashboard providing accurate and important information that is publicly accessible.”

But emails from Jones through April showed that Jones was the one responding to feedback from researchers in a bid to improve and update her product. Jones told the USA TODAY Network that she alone was responsible for ""every line of code.""

In a May 5 email in which she announced the launch of a Spanish-language version of the dashboard, Jones wrote: ""Please be patient as we get all this connected and running smoothly, and do let me know if you see any errors."" It was sent the same day she was removed from her role managing of the dashboard.

For 60-days Jones said she never took a day off, not even when a powerful April 12 Easter tornado leveled her parents' home in Southeast Mississippi. A GoFundMe page was set up to help her family recover. Luckily, her mother survived. Her father, a truck driver, was in Texas at the time.

""Sorry if I’ve been a little slow to respond these last few days,"" she wrote to data users in an email just 3 days later reporting updates to how data was organized, and the inclusion of county-level race data.

Jones provided detailed updates in emails every few days, often technical and always responsive to user feedback. At the time was dismissed, she was working on making historical data more accessible to users.

On April 25, Jones provided an explanation to why the data set would go from morning and evening daily updates to just once per day.

""We’re gearing up to provide more analytics and data, and would not be able to process the full dataset twice daily with the staff we have,"" she wrote.

""We have been directed to start tracking data related to reopening, and it is consuming a lot of staff hours on very short notice.""

Days later she would be removed from the position entirely and her data users sounded the alarm that government might be censoring science.

Jones had worked with the Department of Health as a geospatial analyst and then a Geographic Information System (GIS) manager since obtaining her doctorate in Geography from Florida State University in 2018.

She holds a masters of science degree in geography and mass communication from Louisiana State University and a bachelors in Journalism and Geography from Syracuse University.

The Department of Health has so far not replied to request for comment.

He was never alone for long.

Inevitably, someone would spot the legendary high school football coach and stop by to say hello, to share a story, but most often to ask his advice.

“He couldn’t be out there 10 minutes before someone would come up,” said his son, Wayne Reese Jr. “I would hear the stories all the time. Just the other day someone told me, ‘You know, your father is the reason that I am the man I am today.’”

In New Orleans, a city weathered both by natural and socioeconomic storms, Coach Reese was both a pillar and a safe harbor.

He knew success on the field – amassing 250 career wins and seeing players like hall-of-fame running back Marshall Faulk reach the NFL – and off it, where he coached generations of young people – now lawyers, general contractors, bus drivers and educators – on how to win at life.

Spring was typically the time when Reese and Frank Daggs, 42, his longtime assistant coach at McDonogh 35 High School, took their players around the region to watch college scrimmages. They were opportunities for the kids to see what it took to play at the next level and to connect with coaches and scouts who might have scholarships to offer.

But by March 13, the day Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards ordered all state schools to close in response to the coronavirus, Reese was suffering the symptoms of what he thought was a cold.

Less than three weeks later, on April 2, he took his last breaths from a ventilator in a makeshift coronavirus wing of Tulane Hospital in New Orleans. He was 75 and is survived by his wife, Stella Chase Reese, and four children and six grandchildren.

A month after Reese’s death, current and former players said they miss their coach’s presence the most. “When Coach Reese talked, you listened,” said Clifford Chattman, now a 22-year-old senior defensive back at Texas A&M.

Chattman was 13, a shy, indifferent student, when Reese came to his seventh grade class and spoke with the boy, already a star on his rec league football team. During the meeting, the coaches didn’t talk with him about football, and they didn’t try to recruit him. Reese simply asked the boy about himself and how he was doing in school.

“He didn’t even know whether I would be playing for him then,” Chattman said. “So for him to already be known as this legendary coach, and he shows up at my school, and he’s there to see me? That told me a lot about him right then.”

After Chattman came to play at McDonogh 35, Reese was unrelenting about the importance of good grades and taught Chattman to ask his teachers for help if he struggled in class. When colleges came recruiting, Reese urged him to pick the school where he felt most at home. Chattman will earn his bachelor’s degree this summer in youth development.

“Coach told me, ‘No matter the situation in life, just be yourself. You’ll always go the furthest in life by being yourself,’” Chattman said.

For Reese, that meant being the rock that everyone around him could lean on. They saw it three years ago when one of his players, Devin “Duke” Winters, passed away from a sudden heart attack the morning he was supposed to leave for a visit to Syracuse University.

Reese was returning from a coaching seminar when he heard the news, his friend and athletic director Kevin Sanders said. Instead of going home, Reese and the other coaches huddled at school to brainstorm how best to support Duke’s family and classmates.

Sanders said he never saw Reese shed a tear for his fallen player; he was too busy being the shoulder for others to cry on. “The school is a safe haven for most of the kids,” Sanders said. “As a PE teacher, (Reese) basically touched every student in the building.”

Up until the day Reese left his office for the last time, Sanders said the coach had a photograph of Winters in his window. His voice welled with emotion as he recalled his son recently pointed out that April 2, the day Reese died, was also Duke’s birthday.

“He said ‘Duke got the best birthday present ever,’” Sanders said. “‘He got his coach back.’”

In the end, Reese never told his son anything was wrong. Wayne Reese Jr. always had to go to his mother to learn if anything was wrong. She told him his father wasn’t feeling well.

The last time he spoke with his father, Reese Jr., also a high school head coach who twice went head to head with his father’s teams, had to hold back his own tears as his father told him that all he wanted to do was go home.

“I had to tell him: ‘You’re not the coach right now, you’re the player. And the doctors, they’re the coaches. So if they say you have to stay there right now, then that’s what you have to do.’”

After his death, Reese’s students, colleagues and friends organized a drive-by caravan around the school to honor him within social distancing rules.

A trumpet player from the school’s band played the alma mater next to the school’s marquee, which bore Reese’s name along with a tribute that read: “The man, the legend, our coach!”

What breaks his son’s heart is that his father, who spent most of his life surrounded by people, died in the hospital bed without family and close friends.

Even now, he says, his father's spirit is not far from him. Its echoes are in the words he shared with generations of students and with those who couldn’t pass without stopping by the coach’s front porch to seek his counsel.

“With things I’ve dealt with just these past few weeks, in my mind, I’m thinking, what would my dad do?” Reese Jr. said. “And sometimes I’ll just look up and say ‘Daddy, talk to me.’ Because he always had all the answers.”

As people are trying to stay safe and disinfect their homes during the coronavirus pandemic, families are searching for ways to buy hand sanitizer, toilet paper and other household essentials to help them stay safe and healthy in quarantine.

One of the biggest problems, though, is that most of those everyday products are still selling out at lightning-quick speeds. This is especially true when it comes to cleaning wipes, which topped the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) list of disinfectants that can help protect against COVID-19. Lysol spray and Clorox wipes could even potentially be in low supply through the end of June.

Whatever you do, don't panic—you can still get your hands on enough cleaning supplies for the whole family—and skip the big crowds in stores—if you shop them at these online retailers. While we'll be updating this list daily, supplies are selling out extremely fast, so we recommend not putting it off more than you need to. Here are the places online where you can buy cleaning wipes and spray right now.

Where to buy cleaning wipes and spray

Cleaning wipes that actually disinfect surfaces are one of the hardest things to find right now, but you can occasionally get them along with cleaning sprays at the following retailers:

Staples

Target

Walmart

Make your own disinfectant wipes

Despite the current shortage of Lysol and Clorox wipes, you can also make your own CDC-approved wipes right at home using a precise balance of bleach or alcohol. We put together comprehensive instructions on how to do so.

How to use cleaning wipes

If you already have cleaning supplies around the house, you'll want to be certain that you're using them the right way. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), disinfection won't happen immediately—it can actually take up to three to five minutes.

Although wipes and sprays are on the EPA's list of approved disinfectants, you may not be using them long enough to keep whatever surface you're cleaning—like a countertop, for instance—wet for the recommended amount of time to kill germs.

As a good rule of thumb, you may want to set a timer so you can monitor surfaces to ensure they're still wet. You may also want to make sure that you're sanitizing frequently-used objects and surfaces daily, especially when it comes to doorknobs, keyboards, faucet handles and more. You don't want to forget your phone, either—you can even use Clorox wipes or 70% isopropyl alcohol on Apple products, according to Apple.

Jonathan Chan, senior lab testing technician at Reviewed, recommends following best practices, and advises that if you're using wipes, you should make sure you're only wiping in one one direction, as studies have suggested that doing so can reduce the risk of recontamination.

Special to USA TODAY

The coronavirus pandemic has upended the personal finances of millions of workers and their loved ones. And one recent trend is of particular concern.

Many workers who have been furloughed or laid off are now strapped for cash. And they're considering borrowing money from their 401(k) instead of using other sources of funds.

Advisers recommend tapping all other sources of money before borrowing from your 401(k).

“Please stay away from retirement accounts,” says Chris Chen, a certified financial planner with Insight Financial Strategists. “The long-term damage is absolutely horrible.”

The economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which is closing businesses and forcing millions out of work, makes it even less appealing.

“We like to use 401(k) loans as a last resort, especially in a challenging financial environment,” says Dan Galli, a certified financial planner with Daniel J. Galli & Associates.

No match:My company just stopped their 401(k) match. What should I do?

Wall St. vs. Main St.:Here's why the market is better than the economy right now

Reason to avoid 401(k) loans

Galli also advises against 401(k) loans for this reason:

Plan sponsors, according to the IRS, may require an employee to repay the full outstanding balance of a loan if he or she terminates employment or if the plan is terminated. And that could put even more financial stress on your finances if you’re already desperate for living expenses.

Even worse: If you, the employee, are unable to repay the loan, then your employer will treat it as a distribution and report it to the IRS.

“The country is littered with stories about folks that took 401(k) withdrawals with every attempt to pay the money back, but never got around to it,” says Charles Sachs, a certified financial planner with Kaufman Rossin Wealth. “Imagine the lost growth over a 20-, 30- or 40-year period. If people think they have it tough now, they should imagine when they are in their 80s without the benefit of a nice sized 401(k).”

One bit of good news: You, the employee, can avoid the immediate income tax consequences by rolling over all or part of the loan’s outstanding balance to an IRA or eligible retirement plan by the due date for filing the Federal income tax return for the year in which the loan is treated as a distribution.

What to tap instead

So, where might you find money for living expenses? Well, for starters consider that each option has its pros and cons.

But in the main, borrowing from family, a home equity line of credit and credit cards should be used before borrowing from a 401(k), says Galli.

Thomas Scanlon, a certified financial planner with Raymond James, also recommends tapping your Roth IRA. “Your contributions to the Roth IRA can be withdrawn any time, income tax and penalty free,” he says. “This is because the contributions go in after tax.”

If you’re owed a refund, file your 2019 tax return right away. That’s another source of cash, says Rita Cheng, a certified financial planner Blue Ocean Global Wealth. Likewise, follow up on your stimulus check if you haven’t received that yet.

And, for some, accessing the cash value in your life insurance is another source of funds, says Cheng.

You might be able to take a hardship distribution from your 401(k) plan. Typically, it’s allowed for an immediate and heavy financial need, and limited to the amount necessary to satisfy that financial need. But experts generally advise against this tactic. That's because because you will have to pay taxes on the distribution, and you can’t pay the distribution back into your 401(k).

Bottom line: List all your available options and create a plan that will best position you to weather a difficult storm, says David Mullins, a certified financial planner with David Mullins Wealth Management Group.

When a 401(k) loan is the best option

To be fair, a 401(k) loan may be the best option, depending on the expected need and the length of time, and what other options are available. But remember “you are pulling from funds in a down market and missing out on a potential recovery,"" says David Shotwell, a certified financial planner Shotwell Rutter Baer. ""It may be less interest cost, but the long-term cost can be much greater.”

The right way and the wrong way: If you borrow money from your 401(k) plan, there are best practices to follow. When you take a loan, you are selling securities, says Leon LaBrecque, a certified financial planner with Sequoia Financial Advisors. And given that, Robert Braglia, a certified financial planner with American Financial & Tax Strategies, advises against taking the money on a pro-rata basis across all investment options but rather specify which ones, probably cash or bonds, will be sold.

The Cares Act: According to Ed Slott, a CPA with Ed Slott and Company, the CARES Act increases the maximum loan amount for qualified individuals to the lesser of $100,000 (reduced by other outstanding loans) or 100% of the account balance, and, two, allows qualified individuals to take up to $100,000 of penalty-free coronavirus-related IRA and company plan distributions during 2020. If you’re a qualified individual, either the loan or distribution could be a source of funds for living expenses.

Special for USA TODAY

“One Morgan” is a saying among the approximately 20,000 people in Georgia’s Morgan County. But a county that preaches such a unified message is now as spread apart as ever, just like countless counties, cities and towns across the United States.

And like their peers around the country, seniors at Morgan County High have been deprived of prom, graduation and the last day of high school, not to mention their final sports seasons.

Coaches and administrators at the school demonstrated what it means to be “One Morgan” by delivering a personalized yard sign to all their seniors on the day it was announced spring sports were canceled. Baseball coach Merritt Ainslie even helped wrangle some cows that got loose from one family's pasture during a delivery.

“You would have thought I was giving them a million dollars,” tennis coach Stacy Manger said of the yard signs, which went to all seniors but were delivered by spring coaches to their seniors. “It was like we were coming home from World War II. It was just an incredible feeling and one I will never forget.”

In order to gauge the impact of coronavirus on athletes and coaches at one high school, sports journalism students from the University of Georgia spoke in April with members of the Morgan County community. These are their stories:

Comforting athletes

Manger walks her dogs past a collection of desolate tennis courts every day. She gazes at them, wishing she could still be with her players.

Manger, a former college athlete and now a licensed professional counselor, sympathizes with her “second family.”

“I’m thanking God that I got the degree I did because it’s helped me to not only be a better coach, but be able to help others,” said Manger.

Senior Sara Moore’s relationship with Manger has helped her put the sudden and cruel cancellation of her last high school tennis season behind her.

“She’s like a second mom to me,” Moore said. “She’s always there for us.”

High school coaches everywhere have a new task: comforting their athletes, especially the seniors.

Girls soccer coach Anne Stamps is navigating her way through “what feels like a grieving process.” In an attempt to bond with her players, Stamps wrote each of them a letter and sent those with a team picture “as something to bring us together.”

Stamps’ son Ethan also had his senior baseball season taken from him.

“I see it as a mom of a senior and then as a coach of seniors,” she said. “So I kind of know the face they put on for the public but I see them at home, and they’re really bummed out. No matter if they’re telling me they’re OK, I can tell if they’re really not because I see it at my own house. I think that’s helped me reach out to these seniors.”

Morgan County High had an enrollment of 939 students as of last October. Approximately 450 of them participated in one or more sanctioned athletic activity.

Unanswered questions

Seth Robertson and his teammates had already run a school record-setting 4x100-meter relay this season. He made no qualms about his expectations: the Bulldogs’ first state championship in the event.

“It was devastating, for sure, just knowing that we could never finish,” said Robertson, a football standout committed to Georgia Southern who also played on the Morgan County baseball team. “It’s always going to be that not knowing that we could go on to the state level and show what we had.”

For the senior athletes of Morgan County, like thousands of others across the country, the premature end to their seasons left many unanswered questions – on the field and in their relationships.

Haylee Patterson and her golf teammates were playing in their first tournament of the season when they realized the impact that coronavirus would have on the remainder of the schedule. Patterson was looking forward to helping rebuild a young team with fellow senior Maitlin Stapp.

“We loved playing with each other,” Patterson said. “We had made a really good friendship the last two years. It’s been really tough on us.”

Although Patterson takes solace in being able to golf later in life, drifting away from her friends is not the storybook ending she dreamed for her high school career.

“I think we’re really missing out on our final goodbyes,” Patterson said. “It just felt like it was taken so fast.”

Patterson and Robertson stay in touch with former teammates and work out in their backyards to maintain semblances of bygone routines. While Robertson stays fit in hopes of going to Statesboro in June for orientation and summer camp, the possibility of no college football this fall weighs heavily on him.

“That’s heartbreaking,” Robertson said. “I just hope that I can go out there on Saturday and play ball really.”

Pondering football

Doug Connelly, Morgan County’s athletic director, strives to mimic the normal work day, getting to his desk by 8 a.m., in his red M-lettered ball cap.

That desk, however, normally serves as his family’s dining room table. And instead of having it to himself, it's a multi-purpose workstation. His wife, Ivey Connelly, is a teacher. Their three children -- Trace, 10; Lila Mae, 7, and Tucker 5 – are students. They all use the same space.

He works on projects (notably a revised athletic handbook) and communicates with coaches virtually. He has the freedom of an extra hour’s sleep. But something feels off. Connelly yearns for daily handshake greetings with colleagues.

""Nothing is typical any more,"" Connelly said. ""This is all so new.""

A cloud of uncertainty looms over Connelly, too. With sports grounded, there's no plan for when, or if, football season — the main money maker — will begin.

Connelly has no concerns for lost spring-sport gate revenues. The cancellation of championships, and the travel expenses that saves, serves as a financial ""wash,"" he said. The county’s board of education also provides funding.

The issue lies with the uncertainty of football season and sponsorships. Connelly had designed a branding-display package for businesses. Some scheduled quarterly or bi-annual payments, and one is due in June. Connelly is debating whether to delay or cancel the collection.

""It's very important for us and helps run our teams,"" Connelly said. ""It's a huge concern as to whether they'll renew sponsorship.""

Everybody knows each other in Madison, so Connelly is extra aware of the burdens small businesses face. He’s trying to keep his programs afloat while not putting his neighbors in a position to sink.

Connelly struggles to find a solution. One that might not come until he’s back at his school office.

""When we do have our first football game, I feel confident that people will support,"" principal Miki Edwards said.

Chasing dad

Ethan Stamps needed eight home runs to break his father’s school career record of 32. Stamps hit five in the last two series the Bulldogs played.

“Every time I hit a home run, I looked at my dad, and we laughed at each other, because he was getting worried I was actually going to beat the record,” Ethan Stamps said.

Crandall Stamps graduated in 1988.

The younger Stamps will play baseball at Lipscomb University in Tennessee next season. His goals for this last high school season were to hit the ball hard and get on base, he said, but the thought of beating his dad’s record constantly ran through his mind.

“By him getting closer and closer with the home runs he hit, it gave him more drive and focus to keep working hard,” Crandall Stamps said. “It would have meant a lot to him.”

Not being able to beat the record was tough, Ethan Stamps said, but losing his final season with his teammates after a good start in region play was tougher.

Ainslie, the coach, said he hopes to get the whole team together over the summer to play one last game.

“When we are done with the shutdown, we would like to have a senior night and a banquet and a final intrasquad game, so they can have some memories of going out on the field one last time."" Ainslie said. ""We all need that.”

Recalling 9/11

Bill Malone has thought about 9/11 often in recent weeks. The Morgan County football coach for 26 years sees a lot of similarities in his community between then and now: fear, tragedy, uncertainty.

Back then, though, the time it took to return to normality was shorter.

“During 9/11, we canceled football games for that week,” Malone said. “But, by God, we knew we’d be out there next week.”

Things are different from 9/11, and by a wide margin. The rallying cry following the terrorist attacks for a small-town community gathering at a high school sports event can’t be replicated in a time of social distancing. For each day that rally doesn’t come, anxieties in Morgan County grow.

“This has been like a bulldozer to us,” Malone said. “This thing is just continuing to pile up and pile up and pile up, and we don’t know when it’s going to stop.”

You can hear the impact of COVID-19 shutdowns in people’s voices in Madison. Malone can also see it in the town square. What used to be a gathering place is now a ghost town.

“I have a very big concern for small businesses,” Malone said. “You go to the post office and that's about the only place you can go to in the town square.”

Football season serves as a beacon of hope here that can bring pride and joy back to the community. Now, a fall football season is in question, and hope dwindles as uncertainty grows.

As he slowly recovers from a near-death bout of COVID-19, the disease brought on by the coronavirus, at an acute care hospital near San Antonio, Wilkins and his loved ones face a new worry: states pushing to reopen stores and economies.

""People don’t really understand how serious this is until they know somebody who's going through it,"" said Rebecca Patterson, Wilkins' longtime girlfriend. ""It's only a matter of time before everyone in the country knows someone.""

She added, ""I don’t know what the solution is, but I don’t think hurrying to open things up is it.""

Thousands of coronavirus survivors are returning home after long, harrowing hospital stays to face lingering symptoms, job losses, staggering medical bills and stigma attached to surviving the virus that has infected roughly 1.5 million people in the USA and killed nearly 90,000.

Coronavirus may last 2 years, study warns: And its second wave could be worse

Many worry that states rushing to rescind stay-at-home orders and allow businesses to reopen will unleash a new wave of infections.

The debate over how fast states should reignite their economies flared last week when Dr. Rick Bright, a government immunologist, told a congressional committee that the window is closing fast to prevent the “darkest winter in modern history” if the nation doesn’t improve its response to the coronavirus.

Bright filed a whistleblower complaint alleging he was ousted from his federal post in retaliation for his views. President Donald Trump called Bright an ""angry, disgruntled employee"" and has continued pushing states to reopen and rekindle the struggling economy.

Leaders in some states, including Wisconsin and Texas, advocated for the reopening of small businesses with the same guidelines as essential services, such as supermarkets, even as their COVID-19 cases mount.

Last week, the Wisconsin Supreme Court eliminated Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' stay-at-home order, prompting patrons to stream into bars and restaurants across the state.

""Do we need statewide rules for the run-of-the-mill opening of restaurants or small retailers? I don’t think so,” state Rep. Joan Ballweg told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

Dashauna Ballard, 28, an educator from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, said state officials would slow the pace of reopenings if they'd been through a COVID-19 scare. Ballard tested positive for the disease in early April after experiencing body aches, fatigue, fever and shortness of breath. She drove herself to a hospital and spent eight hours in the intensive care unit as doctors debated putting her on a ventilator.

Her breathing improved the next day, and she was released. Her job working with at-risk high school students was suspended, and school officials were wary of letting her return to campus to collect her personal items after learning she had contracted the virus, she said. Some friends have been reluctant to meet with her after discovering she had COVID-19.

Despite the stigma and uncertain economic future, Ballard said she's glad to be feeling better and recovering at her mother's home in Selma. She's worried states will reopen too soon.

""You are just potentially making the problem worse,"" Ballard said. ""It's not something you'll want to go through. ... You don’t want to feel that feeling of your breath taken away when you bend down to tie your shoes. You don't want to go through that, no matter what age you are.""

Dr. Omar Maniya, an emergency medicine resident at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, has seen both sides of the pandemic. Working in the hospital's emergency department, he's treated almost 200 COVID-19 patients, seen them struggling to breathe and had scores of them die on his shift.

One day in early March, Maniya woke up with chills, body aches and a fever that spiked to 102. As was the protocol at the time, he stayed home for a week, until his symptoms passed, then returned to work. He tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, a sign that he probably had the disease.

Maniya said he's worried that as states reopen, they'll experience the surge that hit New York, which leads the nation in confirmed cases (350,000) and deaths (28,000).

""I fear that many people around the country not experiencing this in their state are rolling their eyes thinking, 'It's not going to happen here,' "" Maniya said. ""A majority of states still have rising cases every day. I don’t think this is, by any means, under control.""

Virginia Bennett, 77, is an active grandmother of four. She shuttled between her home in Indiana and her winter home in Naples, Florida, and took line dancing classes five days a week.

In mid-March, she felt suddenly ill in Naples and went to a hospital. X-rays showed her lungs ravaged by the virus. Doctors moved her to an ICU and placed her on a ventilator immediately, where she spent the next 36 days. Family members had no access to her, relying on twice-a-day phone updates from doctors and nurses.

Slowly, in early May, she began to improve and was released from the hospital May 8. Masked doctors, nurses and technicians applauded as Bennett was wheeled out of the hospital to the sounds of the Beatles' ""Here Comes the Sun"" playing on the hospital PA system.

Bennett was transferred to another critical care hospital, where she would begin her long recovery from the disease, daughter Jennifer Grytza said. Doctors said Bennett might be at her new hospital for several more months.

Before COVID-19 nearly took her mom's life, Grytza, a sales manager at a hotel chain who lost her job early in the pandemic, said she believed states should reopen as soon as possible. Now, she's not so sure.

""I know people need to get back to work,"" she said. ""I want to say, 'Let's reopen, but do it with caution and sensitivity to your neighbors and friends.' ""

Alice Police, a Westchester, New York, breast cancer surgeon, thought she could ride out the virus at home in late March when she was hit with flu-like symptoms and tested positive for COVID-19. As her condition worsened, she was admitted to a hospital in early April.

Doctors discovered Police was experiencing what's known as a ""cytokine storm,"" in which the body releases a surge of immune responses to combat a virus, a condition that could turn deadly.

“It’s like a thunderstorm for the body,” Police, 66, said. ""It’s where the body is basically willing to kill you to kill the virus.”

Police was diagnosed with pneumonia. She was never intubated but struggled to breathe. She suffered from anxiety attacks, especially at night. After a few days, her condition improved, and five days later, she was released from the hospital. Later, symptoms reemerged, and Police returned to the hospital for a plasma infusion.

Recovering at home, she said she feels the country and its leaders are not taking the contagion seriously enough.

“This push to reopen is very, very wrong and short-sighted,” Police said. “The second wave could be worse.”

As the coronavirus began its explosive spread across New York City in March, Wilkins, 62, a well-known trombonist in New York, chose to ride out the pandemic with his mother and relatives in his hometown of San Antonio. In late March, he complained of congestion and fatigue but thought it was allergies flaring up.

On April 4, he texted Patterson, his longtime girlfriend, to tell her he felt ""much better."" Two hours later, Wilkins was rushed to the hospital, unresponsive, and immediately placed on a ventilator.

""It just escalated so quickly,"" Patterson said.

For the next 30 days, Wilkins was heavily sedated and struggling to breathe. The recipient of a kidney transplant six years ago, his only working kidney failed, and he had to be placed on dialysis. His white blood cell count shot up, and his blood pressure plummeted. He received a tracheotomy to make it easier for air to enter his lungs.

Doctors called Patterson to tell her Wilkins might not make it through the day. She rushed to the hospital and spoke to him from the nurse's station via a walkie talkie that a nurse held up to Wilkin's ear in his room.

""Hang in there,"" Patterson told him. ""I know it's not your time, and we'll be hanging out again soon.""

Slowly, in early May, his condition began to improve. He was able to breathe on his own and was transferred to a long-term acute care hospital in nearby New Braunfels. Thursday, he took his first bite of solid food in over a month.

Patterson said she doesn't know how soon Wilkins can return to his music career or whether there will be much of an industry left when he does. Wilkins, an Air Force veteran, has health insurance underthe Department of Veterans Affairs,but Patterson suspects it won't cover most of his medical bills, which she expects will be staggering. She started a GoFundMe.com site and personal website to try to raise money to cover his medical expenses.

Patterson relishes Wilkins' small victories, such as forming a few words using a Passy-Muir speaking valve and regaining the use of his fingers.

""It doesn't matter how old you are,"" she said. ""It's a serious disease with long-term effects.""

Special for USA TODAY

For millions of kids and teens in America each year, summer camp is a cherished part of childhood. It’s often a young person’s first foray with freedom. Or maybe it’s a chance to run wild in the great outdoors, playing all day, and splurging on s’mores around the campfire all night.

Whatever the case, it’s a moment in the short window of being a kid, where everyone involved can make lifelong friends and lasting memories – and parents can get a little break, too.

But this year?

“It’s another thing that COVID-19 has taken away,” says parenting expert Jennifer Kelman.

Kelman, a mom of 10-year-old twins and a licensed clinical social worker, says she’s getting this question dozens of times every day right now, while she and many other families try to figure out what to do with summer camp plans. “With shelter-in-place orders, this pandemic has taken the connection away for children and adults,” she adds.

State of the summer camp

The U.S. has more than 14,000 year-round and summer camps serving an estimated 20 million campers annually, along with more than a million camp workers. Together, it fuels an $18-billion industry according to the American Camp Association. Now, nearly everyone involved is stuck at home trying to figure out what’s going to happen next with the pandemic. Parents are desperate for answers, while camps are scrambling to come up with a plan to avoid complete shutdown or, worse yet, the collapse of their entire business.

Can technology save the day?

Already, at least 22 programs across the country have announced they will hold some form of “online camp” this summer. Just like the internet turned office workers into remote employees overnight, “online camps” hope to bring activities and fun to kids while keeping them safe from the ongoing health crisis.

Unhappy campers:Parents are concerned amid summer camp uncertainty

Pivoting to online courses is a big transition for kids who expected to be spending weeks socializing and making new friends. Many parents also wonder if more screen time is good for kids at this point.

“My kids are changing before my eyes because of how much screen time they’re getting between online learning and just trying to physically connect with her friends,” says Sacramento-based attorney and working mom of two, Leslie Sindelar. “So I’m feeling very anti-tech right now. If our traditional summer camps aren’t available, do I concede and sign them up for online camp anyway?”

Virtual summer camps

The Oregon-based outdoor-adventure camp company, Trackers Earth, was among the first to take its after-school and summer classes online last month, shortly after shelter-in-place orders left many parents – and kids – desperate for options. They named the virtual options Trackers Spark. “Our online camps are live, small group interactive webinars,” Trackers Co-Founder, Tony Deis told me over the phone. “It’s usually a ratio of one teacher or guide for a maximum of eight students, and they (the instructors) bring one-of-a-kind skills and expertise to every single day, just like they do in real life.”

Trackers Spark courses are tailored to kids ages 4 to 14, and they offer just about every area of interest you could think of, from outdoor safety and survival to arts and crafts, even role-playing and light-hearted “secret agent” training. Most online camps are 30 minutes to an hour in length and run $5 to $25 dollar for a single class, with discounts if parents buy them as a series.

Deis says the idea isn’t to distract kids with a screen, but rather to use a computer or tablet as a window to the same kind of camp instructor they would follow at an in-person camp. “We want to keep kids active and connected. What each camper does varies based on the topic, but every program is more than passive screen time,” Deis explained.

Right now, all of the Trackers Spark courses are offered in Pacific time zones via private, secure Zoom video calls. Trackers is headquartered in Portland, Oregon, but Deis says they’ve already had campers join in from New York, Maryland, and even Sweden to take the live classes.

“He shooed me out of the room, before it started,” parent Terrie Jarrell says regarding her 12-year-old son’s experience in the recent “Realms: Elite Guard Campaign” class. “He's not forthcoming with details, other than his party fought ogres for breakfast food.”

“These classes have been completely transformative. Particularly while we're sheltering in place,” agreed Oakland mom Saray McCarthy, who says her 7-year-old son is partial to the Evil Secret Agent Academy: World Domination class. “He LOVED the idea of being an evil spy and is really into being the double agent. Trackers creates such an immersive experience, and he just loves that.”

Not all virtual camps are interactive

Just like every in-person summer camp is different, each online camp offers its own special take on what kids and teens might want too. Deis says most online camps break down into three categories:

Videos kids watch. These are often subscriptions. Webinars with large groups, where the interaction is something 20+ kids can do together. Small group, interactive webinar-type classes.

Deis says his company chose to go the No. 3 route because, “it lets kids be social, connecting with each other, and getting personal interaction with the teacher.”

Another camp founder I spoke with has created a different kind of virtual online camp called Happy Camper Live. It’s packed with web series, live programs, and a 360 virtual tour of their Camp Starlight sleepaway camp in Pennsylvania, no VR headset required. The video activities are taught by real camp counselors – but none of them are interactive – on purpose.

“What we offer is not a Zoom room,” says Happy Camper Live founder Allison Miller. “That might work well for some of the other camps, but we already know that parents are going to be the real camp counselors this summer, and we’ve created a critical resource for both kids and parents. The whole concept is for kids to get inspired and go out and do something new.”

Happy Camper’s videos are typically two to six minutes long and cover a wide range of activities such as magic tricks, sports drills, arts and crafts projects, performing arts, and outdoor skills. Each day, there are a handful of free videos, and a yearly subscription costs around $12.

Miller says their goal is to offer kids and parents dozens of different options for fun things they can learn, master, and do on their own – or with each other. “The whole concept is for kids to get inspired and go out and do something,” Miller added. “We can’t bring every kid to summer camp, but we can bring summer camp to them.”

Parental supervision required

Typically, one of the best things about sending the kiddos off to camp is that the adults get a bit of breathing room. That’s missing from online camps, and most of them suggest a parent or guardian be on-hand – or at least nearby – for additional support.

All of the camp owners I spoke with reiterated that these online courses are not a replacement for parenting. In other words, don't stick them in front of a screen and zone-out for the next hour or two. Trackers Spark tells parents before they register for any course, that the classes need some level of guardian supervision, which they rate as follows:

Phone On – Guardians must be in the same house with a phone on for notifications. Example – Martial Arts

Eyes On – Guardians must be close enough to observe. Ready to help. Example – Cooking

Hands On – Guardians with the camper to offer immediate help and co-guidance. Example – Woodcarving

Will online summer camp work?

Will online summer camp work? Absolutely. It already is – as a “recess,” or maybe even “re-set” – of sorts for parents running out of ideas to keep kids entertained, active, and from fraying their last nerve.

The classes I’ve audited have been fun, informative, engaging, and an obvious relief for kids and parents alike. Last week, I learned how to walk in the woods without making any noise. I loved that, and so did the half-dozen 7- to 10-year-olds learning “tracking skills” along with me. There were also a few times kids seemed so excited just to have others youngsters their own age to talk with, it really drove home the need for continued connection with people their own age.

As a parent myself, I do have one word of warning here: Make sure each instructor is properly vetted, as you would with anyone you trust to care for your child, virtual or otherwise. Most in-person camps require counselors to get background checked, fingerprinted, and bring specific skills and experience to the environment. Make sure online camps offer the same. Then – take a deep breath – and get ready to learn some fun stuff, too.

All of these online options offer more than any of us could possibly dream up ourselves, so why not use what’s available at our fingertips to help us all get through these trying times? To echo what one of the camp owners said, “when kids are exposed to a lot of different things, it helps them find their passion,” even if that passion this year – is right in our own backyards.

Coming up with a new line of business was the only way Nemetz could keep paying her five-person full-time staff and continue to call part-time workers.

The idea was to bring the sights and tastes of Milwaukee to customers' doors with care packages. Instead of taking people through the city for sausages at Usinger's and pretzels from Milwaukee Pretzel Co., Milwaukee Food & City Tours is packing those items up (along with virtual tour experience access) and shipping it out.

Milwaukee Food & City Tours started in late March with quarantine care kits and shelter-in-style kits.

Nearly 2,000 care packages have been sold. The move is sustaining Nemetz's business. She has not had to furlough staff members. She also received federals funds through the Paycheck Protection Program.

The selection has expanded with specialty care packages for events like birthdays, Mother's Day and Cinco De Mayo. The kits vary in price from around $35 for a chocolate self-care kit to $78 for the ultimate snack break.

Milwaukee Food & City Tours is thinking about offering tours again to private groups with guides leaving adequate distance and talking through headsets. But it's also thinking about how these care packages can become a lasting part of the business.

""For the next couple of years, it's possible that some individuals won't be able to do a tour,"" she said. Instead of having travelers visit Milwaukee to learn about the city, she'll ship the experience to them.

We leave a pack of gloves for the trash collector. We pick up an extra jug of milk for a friend. We take to the streets and burst into ragged song, and we laugh. We welcome new babies into an uncertain, confusing world, and we allow ourselves to be overtaken by the world's oldest and most elemental joy. We learn to appreciate every breath.

Stories can infuse meaning into events that feel random and cruel. They are our history and our guide. The stories here remind us that others have survived this and worse, and that we can find, in so much churning loss, kernels of resolve.

We're proud to bring you these stories – human moments of resilience and sacrifice and celebration and faith. If you know of someone we should write about, send us a note. We'd love to tell your story, too.

USA TODAY NETWORK

In hundreds of cities across the USA, scientists hope monitoring systems will provide an early warning if coronavirus infections reemerge as communities in some states cautiously reopen.

These monitors don't rely on testing patients or tracing contacts.

All that's required? Human waste.

Over the past few months, private companies and university researchers have partnered with communities to collect sewage at treatment plants and test it for the presence of the novel coronavirus. The results are reported to municipal governments and state health officials to help them monitor the situation.

Testing wastewater can reveal evidence of the coronavirus and show whether it’s increasing or decreasing in a community, said Ian Pepper, a professor and co-director of the University of Arizona’s Water and Energy Sustainable Technology Center, one of the groups tracking the virus through different municipal sewage systems.

Although they cannot determine the exact number of COVID-19 cases from the wastewater, researchers said they can estimate the potential case count based on the amount of genetic material detected, the number of customers per system and the volume of wastewater generated. They continue to improve upon those estimates, trying to achieve greater accuracy.

They need a better understanding of “how much virus is shed in the stool” when someone is infected, said Newsha Ghaeli, president and co-founder of Biobot Analytics, a startup company formed by a group of researchers with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that is heavily involved in the emerging science.

“As our understanding of this evolves, and as Biobot collects more and more data,” Ghaeli said, “our case estimates will be refined.”

When the coronavirus attacks a person’s body, it leaves a trail of castoff genetic evidence that winds up in wastewater flushed from toilets across a community.

Scientists watched this spring as that evidence emerged at sewage treatment facilities in California, Florida, Massachusetts, Paris, Australia and the Netherlands. By sampling the wastewater, researchers detected COVID-19 hot spots days, and sometimes weeks, before those cases appeared in hospital admissions data and clinical testing.

Such early detection – the virus marks the body before or even without the development of physical symptoms such as a fever or cough – is aimed at helping communities better respond to the pandemic. Officials can issue stay-at-home orders to prevent further spread. Hospitals can stock and staff ahead of a wave of patients.

The information can help local governments, many of which are reporting declining COVID-19 cases, spot the first signs of an anticipated autumn resurgence. And it can help them measure the effectiveness of their actions. In Paris, the utility provider reported finding coronavirus particles in wastewater before cases began to grow exponentially, then it observed the quantities decrease as a result of a lockdown.

Hundreds of communities

Promising results from initial studies have spawned widespread interest, and the science is expanding to hundreds of public utilities across the USA through a collection of initiatives.

Most prolific is Biobot Analytics, which worked with local governments to track the prevalence of opioid use through wastewater testing before shifting focus to COVID-19 this year. It monitors wastewater data from 400 communities across 42 states.

Using $6.7 million in seed money and collaborating with researchers at MIT, Harvard and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Biobot provides the testing for free.

The company concluded that wastewater sampling in Massachusetts and Delaware indicated a bigger coronavirus outbreak than reported through hospital admissions and clinical testing. In New Castle County, Delaware, the estimates were 15 times the laboratory-confirmed cases.

“This is a high-level way of getting a quick snapshot of the scope of a virus in a community,” Ghaeli said. “We’re hopeful this data becomes very useful in the long run, when we have opened up again, in determining the reemergence of the virus.”

Your guide to COVID-19:What you need to know about the coronavirus

The sewage surveillance, in concert with clinical testing and reported cases, can give officials a broad look at COVID-19 in their community, Ghaeli said. Biobot provides the numbers to participating utilities, which in turn provide the data to officials and health departments, she said.

In early April, the utility in Albany, Oregon, started sharing with Biobot weekly samples of pre-treated sewage from the Albany-Millersburg Water Reclamation Facility.

The weekly sampling occurs alongside routine water testing, meaning little additional work for the staff, said David Gilbey, the city’s environmental services manager. It costs about $120 a week for sample bottles and shipping, according to the city’s website. Results usually come within a week, Gilbey said, and are shared with the county health department.

The research holds “much promise,” Gilbey said. The community has seen declining coronavirus cases and things are starting to reopen, he said. If the wastewater numbers increase, that information would help the utility and local governments “get ready” by adding social distance measures or stockpiling more resources.

“It kind of gives us an idea of what we may be in for over the next couple of months,” he said.

At the University of Arizona, Pepper chairs one of the many committees looking at how to handle the possible return of students to campus this fall. He said the university will sample the campus wastewater for at least a year to monitor coronavirus levels.

In Detroit, officials announced Monday they are refocusing a 2-year-old study with Michigan State University to try to detect COVID-19 in the wastewater. The study was originally designed to determine whether they could track disease-causing viruses in the city's sewer system.

City health officials said the Detroit study found viruses in the sewer collection system about one to two weeks before those same viruses showed up in health department data.

From November 2017 to February 2018, then from October 2018 to March 2019, samples were collected weekly before treatment at Detroit's Water Resource Recovery Facility.

Looking for disease

Scientists hope to promote development of a national wastewater surveillance network to monitor and respond to not just the coronavirus but all kinds of infectious diseases, Ghaeli said.

In Israel, a wastewater-based monitoring system for polio started in 1989. In 2013, when the surveillance indicated a polio outbreak was occurring, government officials swept in with polio vaccines and prevented any cases of paralysis.

Routine sampling for emerging viral diseases isn’t standard practice at most wastewater treatment facilities. Ghaeli hopes it will become permanent and so prevalent that the information is integrated into public health decision-making.

Monitoring wastewater could be especially beneficial as an early warning in a “micro context,” for example at nursing homes or care facilities, where the rapidly spreading coronavirus has been responsible for many deaths, concluded a group of researchers led by Gorka Orive, a biomedical researcher at the University of the Basque Country in Spain.

Even in a larger context, such as a neighborhood or city, the information could help officials adopt more focused and balanced measures, including restricting movement, the researchers wrote in an article to be published in the Elsevier journal Science of the Total Environment. Early warnings, the group wrote, could save lives.

Scientists have studied disease in sewage for years, said Kyle Bibby, an associate professor in civil and environmental engineering at Notre Dame. Researchers in Sweden showed two decades ago that a single infection in one person could be detected in the wastewater from 10,000 people.

As genetic research advances and many groups monitor wastewater for the coronavirus, the science is moving very fast.

“Everyone is sort of learning as they go,” Bibby said.

Bibby’s team works with dozens of utilities, and the research groups collaborate and share what they learn, he said.

More than a dozen research papers have been published, some in pre-print without full peer review, since the beginning of the year.

Additional research is planned.

“This is definitely a community effort,” Bibby said, “through a broad, scientific community.”

But a scattering of remote counties continue without a single reported case, according to a USA TODAY analysis.

As of May 15, a total of 231 of 3,143 counties had no reported cases.

The list is getting shorter by the day, though. In the first half of May alone, 40 counties went from zero recorded cases of the virus to at least one.

Georgia started the month with two zero-case counties. Now there is none. Tennessee also had two counties with no reported cases on May 1; two weeks later, only one remained. Iowa went from eight counties with no cases to only four by mid-May.

Counties where there are no reported cases of COVID-19*

The long stretch without coronavirus cases in some counties likely reflects an undercount from limited testing. But in others it may also reflect the benefits of being relatively cut off. USA TODAY found a strong link between population density and official infection rates across the country.

People in case-free counties said they don't consider their communities immune, just less exposed.

“To get to Hancock County, you either have to go over a ridge or a mountain,” said Tom Harrison, the mayor of Tennessee's last county with no recorded cases. “You don’t just drive by and see us. You have to have us on your mind to get here. And hopefully that had a little something to do with the COVID. It’s had trouble finding us.”

Counties without COVID-19

Studies have shown that the more COVID-19 tests, the more positive cases reported. USA TODAY's analysis found states that still have counties reporting zero cases tested less of their population than others -- about 30.2 tests per 1,000 residents, compared to 37.7 tests per 1,000 in states with cases in every county.

Local officials in counties without reported infections also point to another factor: The counties they live in are overwhelmingly rural, with isolated, sparse populations.

USA TODAY’s analysis included data from its own county-by-county tracking report and demographic characteristics of each county drawn from the U.S. Census and American Community Survey.

The demographic data show counties with no reported cases are mostly isolated areas, drizzled across the nation’s midsection, in the northern plains and in the Southwest.

Texas had 34 of its 254 counties reporting no positive cases – the most of any state. At least 1 in 4 counties in North Dakota, Montana and Alaska were listed as case-free through May 15.

More than 90% of such counties are rural, with a majority of residents living outside a city or large town. Most had five or fewer homes per square mile, and their populations averaged about 5,000.

Among counties with at least one case, the rate gets higher with more residents per square mile, the data show.

In counties with 10 or less people per square mile, the rate is 12 positive COVID-19 cases per 10,000 residents. In counties with more than 100 people per square mile, the case rate is nearly three times as high -- 35.4 per 10,000 residents.

But researchers like Malia Jones, an assistant scientist in health geography at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, say the impact of COVID-19 can’t always be traced to an urban-rural divide.

Jones studies how infectious diseases spread. In Wisconsin, four rural counties have remained case-free, yet plenty of other rural counties have not.

“One thing to consider is, they’ve just been lucky,” Jones told the Wausau Daily Herald earlier this month. “Other rural places that are similar were unlucky, and had a case introduced early on.”

A matter of time

In Georgia’s rural Glascock County, which reported its first case earlier this month, Emergency Management Director Mike Lyons believes the county’s size may have shielded it from COVID-19 for as long as it did. Census data put Glascock County’s population at 3,009, making it the fifth-smallest statewide.

“We don’t have malls or big places to gather,” Lyons said.

Realizing Glascock County's luck might eventually run out, county officials and first responders met for weeks to prepare before their first recorded case came.

County residents did their part – handwashing, social distancing, and complying with community mandates to close schools, nursing homes and churches – all the while, knowing that someone would eventually test positive.

“It wasn’t a matter of if it was going to happen, but when,” said Lori Boyen, chair of the Glascock County Board of Commissioners.

Glascock County got its first case May 1, when a nursing home patient at Gibson Health and Rehabilitation tested positive. The case was first reported publicly last week.

Three days later, nearby Taliaferro County, population 1,665 announced its first positive case, the last county in Georgia to do so.

Lyons said other patients and staff members at the Glascock County rehabilitation center have since tested negative.

News of the initial infections in Georgia’s last two case-free counties brought a more urgent call to action. Last week, officials began hosting drive-thru testing sites at Glascock County and Taliaferro County schools.

Lyons, the Glascock County emergency director, expects more positive cases to emerge as testing becomes more accessible.

Tennessee holdouts

At the base of verdant ridges and mountains in Tennessee, rolling pastures surround the switchback roads into Hancock County.

The drive to Sneedville, the county’s only town, is at least 40 minutes from any nearby city.

It’s a route where unrivaled natural beauty is interrupted only by a smattering of single-family homes, trailers and the scrapyards set up outside some of their doors.

Once in town, there is no Walmart, no Ruby Tuesday. There is one grocery store.

So it should come as little surprise that one of the most isolated areas in Tennessee would be the only remaining county without a case of the novel coronavirus.

Now that Tennessee's virus-related restrictions are being lifted, things are returning to normal in the Appalachian community. But residents and businesses are still taking some precautions.

Phil Harrison, the owner of Harrison Farm & Home supply, a True Value hardware store in town, did only curbside service for five weeks, despite being considered an essential business by the state.

Now, a sign on the door asks customers to wear masks, though few are. A large makeshift plastic screen is set up at the cash register.

More: How one Tennessee county has escaped coronavirus so far

“We wanted to keep it down, and make sure that we did our part in keeping it from getting in here,” said Harrison, uncle of the county mayor with the same last name.

Phil Harrison believes the virus will subside some with warmer weather, but he is concerned that the town’s luck will run out as everyone resumes business as usual.

“Being secluded,"" he said, ""I fear that maybe we’ll get a little lax because of that.""

Per capita, Hancock County’s testing rate for the virus is nearly the worst in the state, according to an analysis by The Tennessean in Nashville. The county has administered 145 tests per 10,000 people, compared to 362 per 10,000 statewide.

More: Coronavirus cases are likely artificially low in some states thanks to flawed testing

But health officials said the testing disparity isn't because of a shortage of tests in the county or people being turned away. It’s a shortage of people showing up to take them.

“It’s possible that there’s an unidentified case there, but we certainly don’t have sick people coming to the emergency room or calling our health department that can't get tests,” said Dr. David Kirschke, medical director of the Tennessee Department of Health’s Northeast region.

Kirschke said isolation and precautions by residents seem to have made a difference. He noted that cellphone tracking data gave Hancock County residents the highest grade in the state for limiting their travel during the pandemic.

“At least relative to the rest of the state and just by that data, which has a lot of limitations, they appear to be doing well with social distancing,” Kirschke said.

Keeping it that way

Isolation has proven to be insulation in Iowa as well, as four farmland counties in the southern tier of the state still have no reported infections.

Out of 99 Iowa counties, only Adams, Decatur, Lucas and Ringgold counties remain on the zero case list – for now.

Residents and small-town businesses in Adams County are doing all they can to stay case-free.

When Iowa officials responded to the pandemic by ordering a shutdown of all dine-in food establishments across the state, folks in Corning, Iowa, population 1,400, adjusted on the fly and began offering restaurant delivery service.

Even after Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds lifted sanctions on some counties that had fewer reported cases of the virus, Corning restaurant owners almost uniformly chose to keep their doors shut to dine-in customers, said Adams Community Chamber director Marti Gebbie.

And the owners remain defiant when it comes to serving customers in counties where cases are prevalent.

Gebbie said one restaurant manager had considered breaking rank and reopening – until the restaurant got a reservation call from a customer in West Des Moines, a city to the north in Dallas County, IA, where reported cases are among the fastest-growing in the United States.

“That's really when they kind of were like, ‘You know what, we don't have any cases. Do we really want people from all these other communities coming to us to dine in our restaurant?’” Gebbie said.

Even as business owners stay vigilant, Adams County Emergency Management Director Bill Lyddon has resigned himself to thinking that there will be cases in the county.

“We're going to get some,” he said. “Whether we've already had some and they just haven't been tested, or whether we're going to get some down the line – I'm sure we will somewhere.”

While hundreds of residents in Iowa's four remaining zero-case counties have completed assessments to see if they need to be tested, fewer than 400 had actually received tests as of last week.

Mary Williams, spokesperson for CHI Health Mercy Corning Hospital, which serves the area, believes the community is ready for a possible COVID-19 outbreak.

CHI Health, like other large health care networks, draws resources and staff from dozens of hospitals, and is able to focus those services on an area if it were in need, said Williams, who operates out of Omaha, just across the Iowa-Nebraska state line.

“We have a rather large footprint in that area,” she said. “We have the power of a system instead of one hospital, and we can go where the need is great.”

In the meantime, Williams believes residents of the four case-free Iowa counties are holding on, with daily doses of precaution and Divine intervention.

“We’re blessed,” she said. “We know things can change daily, but at this moment in time, we’re okay.”

""With the virus continuing to impact communities and ports around the globe, we have made the decision to further suspend cruise voyages across our fleet for all sailings embarking through July 31, 2020,"" Christine Da Silva, spokesperson for Norwegian, told USA TODAY in an email.

The suspension was previoulsy extended to last through the end of June after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention imposed a 100-day no-sail order following outbreaks on ships belonging to multiple cruise lines.

Passengers on three Norwegian ships had symptoms or tested positive after their sailings, the CDC said.

The no-sail order – which was imposed April 15 – required cruise lines to cancel sailings through July 24. Last week, Disney Cruise Line suspended its sailings past the July 24 expiration date until July 27 and Carnival Cruise Line had previously extended its sailing suspension until Aug. 1.

""Despite this further delay, we remain optimistic and expect to relaunch cruise operations in the near future,"" Da Silva said. ""Given the fluid and evolving nature of the circumstances, we are making decisions as quickly and thoughtfully as possible and, as always, we are keeping our guests’ and travel partners’ best interests at heart.""

'Hygiene is the new luxury':How cruise ship design could evolve to ward against outbreaks

Frank Del Rio, CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., said during an earnings call Thursday that Norwegian has been planning a phased relaunch.

Last week, he estimated full resumption of operations could take up to six months across Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings' 28 ships, which are spread across its three brands: flagship Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises.

But he expressed that it will take time and require cooperation with government and health authorities – including the CDC.

Del Rio said wants to do ""everything humanly possible within the bounds of what technology offers today"" to be able to look his family members in the eyes and tell them that Norwegian's cruise ships are safe to board.

Del Rio added that ships won't operate until that point, and when operations start to resume, it will be a gradual process that takes several months.

""Nothing will be more critical to resuming sustained and profitable long term operations than making cruising the safest option in (the) travel and leisure space and providing cruisers with peace of mind,"" Del Rio said.

Passengers who had made a reservation on one of Norwegian Cruise Line's canceled sailings will receive a 125% or 150% future cruise credit, depending on the date of their trip. They can either use that credit through the end of 2022 or opt for a full refund, according to its website.

And they paid the price for it. Literally.

Grocery store bills shot up April, showing the biggest monthly increase in nearly 50 years, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistic's monthly Consumer Price Index report.

While overall the April CPI declined 0.8%, consumers on average paid 2.6% more for groceries. It's the largest one-month increase since February 1974. During the last 12 months, grocery prices rose 4.1%.

Price increases in the meat, poultry, fish and egg category were the steepest.

Mary Kay Ash of Clinton Township, Michigan, is among those who have noticed their average weekly grocery receipts are on the rise. The 54-year-old mom says she typically spent about $100 to $125 a week on groceries for a family of four adults before the pandemic. Now, she says, she is spending $140 to $150.

Her shopping plan means getting to the store early Sunday mornings. She shops in produce first, then heads over to the meat department to see what's available.

Ash said she has noticed grocery prices are up, especially on meat, but also on just about everything, including produce.

Regional CPI statistics are reported on a bimonthly basis. The most current report showed consumers in metro Detroit, for instance, paid 3.3% more for groceries from February to April, the Labor Department said.

Increases reflect classic supply-and-demand economics. Disruptions in the food supply linked to meat processing plant closures and slowdowns, along with a shift in production from restaurants and institutions to retail, led to increases. You can also toss in panic buying.

Several food categories had steep increases.

Prices in the meat, poultry, fish and egg category had the biggest monthly increase as consumers paid 4.3% more for those items in April. Prices were nearly 7% higher over the last 12 months.

When broken out into individual products, egg prices had the biggest jump as consumers paid 16.1% more in April than in March for eggs. Prices for eggs, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) were as high as $3 a dozen in April.

But now, wholesale shell egg prices are at a level closer to what they are expected to be, said Trey Malone, Michigan State University agriculture economist.

""Trend lines in eggs had a massive spike in April and now, as of May 18, it's down,"" said Malone.

Multiple regulations by the federal government were relaxed to allow the shell egg industry to shift supply of eggs from restaurants to retail, Malone said.

The USDA's May 18 Egg News Report has wholesale prices of eggs averaging about $1 a dozen.

While Malone is convinced that overall prices have increased, it's not entirely clear how the CPI goes out and looks at prices in the middle of a pandemic.

""What the CPI is telling you here is something that is changing rapidly,"" he said.

Malone expect price increases to continue at least on the meat side because of a decrease in supply of animals. Contributing to that is the euthanizing of animals by farmers because some processing plants were down with sick workers and an increase in exports.

With pork, Malone also cites a jump in demand for pork exports. Before COVID-19, China was hit with an African swine fever in hogs.

Grocery pork prices were up 3% in April. What's also going on is there's a shortage of certain pork cuts.

""In the U.S., we've gotten very comfortable with this proliferation of options at the grocery stores,"" Malone said. ""Right now, the system is having to flex in a way that we are just going to have to expect there's a limited, smaller number of items in the market while simultaneously the prices will increase. ""

Uncooked ground beef was up 4.8% in April, beef roasts were up 5% and beef steaks saw a 2.1% jump, the Labor Department said. Year over year, ground beef was up a whopping 9.7%.

Ground beef prices have taken Ash by surprise during this pandemic. She has seen packages of ground round or chuck selling as high as $9 a pound.

It's become a grocery store game with Ash and her fiancé where they try to find a cut of meat that's affordably priced and buy two.

""Then I plan my meals from that,"" Ash said. ""It's seems pork was the best buy and still is, so I've been doing many dishes with boneless pork loin.""

While food prices increased, they were offset by lower prices for energy. Year-over-year gas prices were down 32%. Other categories less food and energy that showed decreases included apparel and transportation.

Here's a sampling of some items that increased the most in April:

Apples: 4.9%

Bread 3.7%

Cookies 5.1%

Fresh sweet rolls, coffeecakes, doughnuts: 5%

Hot dogs: 5.7%

Pork chops: 7.4%

Poultry: 5.8%

Michigan residents on alert as Midland could be under 9 feet of water

Urging residents to evacuate and warning that downtown Midland could be under 9 feet of water by Wednesday afternoon, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency after the Edenville and Sanford dams breached. Several dams upstream of Midland along the Tittabawassee had either been breached or were releasing water uncontrollably after 4 to 7 inches of rain fell Sunday and Monday, including the Edenville and Sanford dams, forcing the evacuation of thousands of people in mid-Michigan. ""Please do not hesitate. Go to stay with a friend or relative or go to one of these shelters now,"" Whitmer warned, adding that even at a shelter, people should try to do the best they can to practice social distancing and wear a face covering to protect themselves and others from the coronavirus.

Bring your mask to the Disney Springs reopening

Face masks and temperature checks are in and cash payments are out Wednesday for the partial reopening of Disney Springs, the large shopping, dining and entertainment complex at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. Visitors must have temperature checks before entering and wear face masks except when dining. Disney also will limit the number of people allowed in and in certain areas. Wednesday's move is the first phase of Disney World's comeback plan, the company said, though no reopening dates have yet been announced. The resort has been closed since March amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Retailer J.C. Penney plans to reopen about 115 of its stores on Wednesday that had been closed since March because of COVID-19. Forty-one stores previously reopened. The move comes days after the troubled chain filed for bankruptcy. According to a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, about 29% of the retailer's 846 stores, or 242 locations, will close between the current fiscal year and next fiscal year.

Hundreds of McDonald's workers in 20 cities plan to strike Wednesday, part of an effort to pressure the fast-food chain into improving what they say are inadequate protections for employees from COVID-19. Labor organizers, which include the ""Fight for $15"" minimum wage labor campaign, say there have been dozens of McDonald's workers who have had COVID-19. They also cite a survey of more than 800 McDonald's workers in which nearly one quarter reported being told not to wear masks and gloves and four in 10 reported that social distancing was very difficult or impossible at their restaurants. The company disputes the allegations. The strike comes one day before the company’s annual shareholders meeting.

Millions flee as powerful cyclone threatens India, Bangladesh

A potentially catastrophic cyclone is bearing down on India and Bangladesh, with howling winds, drenching rain and a devastating storm surge. Cyclone Amphan is forecast to make landfall near India's West Bengal state and Bangladesh on Wednesday. Millions of people are evacuating as the storm approaches, while still trying to practice social distancing due to the coronavirus. Amphan's large size and previous extreme intensity will result in an immense amount of water being pushed northward through the Bay of Bengal, the Weather Channel said. India's Meteorological Department is warning that a storm surge of 13 to 16 feet is possible in low-lying areas near where Amphan makes landfall.",100,High,Center,USA,1

Trump's demands, made in a letter Tuesday to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, are an escalation of his attacks on the organization. He accused the WHO of ""repeated missteps"" during the coronavirus pandemic and demanded it ""demonstrate independence"" from China.

""My administration has already started discussions with you on how to reform the organization. But action is needed quickly. We do not have time to waste,"" Trump wrote in his ultimatum, which comes about a month after he froze WHO funding, pending a formal investigation into the international health body and its coronavirus response.

The letter lists Trump's allegations that the United Nations agency missed warning signs of the virus's spread, then blithely accepted China's lack of transparency over the outbreak. The WHO initially circulated preliminary Chinese claims that there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus.

COVID-19:Health Secretary Alex Azar slams WHO as China backs coronavirus investigation

In his letter, Trump did not outline specific actions the WHO needs to take to satisfy his demands. Monday, Trump called the U.N. health body a ""puppet of China.""

Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry, said Trump's letter was ""smearing and slandering China’s efforts in epidemic prevention."" He called it a Trump administration attempt ""to shift responsibility in its own incompetence in handling the epidemic.""

The WHO said in a statement it was ""considering the contents"" of Trump's letter, but otherwise, it had no comment.

The organization has disputed claims from the Trump administration that it acted too slowly in sounding the alarm over coronavirus. Public health experts have long warned the agency is overly bureaucratic and in need of reform. Little evidence has emerged to substantiate accusations from Trump administration officials that the WHO deliberately acted in concert with China to obfuscate what it knew about the outbreak.

Monday, Ghebreyesus said he would launch an independent evaluation of the WHO’s coronavirus response ""at the earliest appropriate moment."" Chinese leader Xi Jinping said he would support an independent investigation into the pandemic, though it remains unclear whether any such review would probe the origins of the virus. Trump has speculated, without giving evidence, that the coronavirus escaped from a lab in Wuhan, China, where the virus emerged late last year.

The United States is the WHO's biggest donor. It paid $400 million to the WHO for 2018-2019, according to the organization's website. That money represents about 15% of the WHO's budget. When Trump said last month that he would temporarily freeze WHO spending, he said he would ""channel"" the money into other areas to combat the coronavirus outbreak. He has not provided specifics on that pledge.

Among the other accusations made in Trump's letter:

He suggested that the WHO, bowing to pressure from China, delayed an emergency declaration connected to the outbreak. (There is no known evidence for this claim.)

He highlighted the global health body's praise of China's government for its ""transparency"" with respect to the coronavirus, setting a ""new standard for outbreak control."" (True. The WHO has gone on record that it believes China has done a good job fighting the coronavirus.)

Trump accused the WHO of ""inexplicably"" opposing his closure of the U.S. border and travel ban from China. (The WHO has consistently argued for years against closing borders and travel bans during pandemics, saying such actions can exacerbate the spread of infectious disease. But it has not publicly questioned Trump's decision.)

He said the agency failed to publicly address accusations of ""China's racially discriminatory actions"" in China against African nationals. (True.)

Trump suggested The Lancet, a British medical journal, published a report in early December about a virus spreading in Wuhan. (False, according to The Lancet. Its editor said the first reports it published were from Chinese scientists Jan 24.)

Analysis: Trump halts funding to WHO. Experts say we need it now more than ever

The WHO held its annual general assembly online, which ends Tuesday. The forum was dominated by many of its 194 members pushing for a review of how the organization responded to the outbreak.

In an interview with the BBC, former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said it would be ""grossly irresponsible in international humanitarian terms"" for the United States to permanently withdraw its funding for the WHO because of its potential impact on poor countries around the world where the virus has yet to have its full impact.

""The WHO goes in and advises and/or provides direct material help with the setting up of health systems to deal with the crisis on the ground,"" he said.",100,High,Center,USA,1

Oprah Winfrey is giving grants to the cities she’s called home through her $12 million coronavirus relief fund.

She announced Wednesday that her Oprah Winfrey Charitable Foundation will donate money to organizations dedicated to helping underserved communities in Chicago; Baltimore; Nashville, Tennessee; Milwaukee; and Kosciusko, Mississippi, where she was born.

“The reason I’m talking about it is because there is going to be a need for people of means to step up,” Winfrey said in an interview with The Associated Press. “I mean, this thing is not going away. Even when the virus is gone, the devastation left by people not being able to work for months who were holding on paycheck to paycheck, who have used up their savings — people are going to be in need. So my thing is, look in your own neighborhood, in your own backyard to see how you can serve and where your service is most essential. That is the real essential work, I think, for people of means.”

After speaking with Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and other leaders, Winfrey decided to give $5 million to Live Healthy Chicago, which provides immediate support to seniors and high-risk residents affected by the coronavirus.

In Nashville, where Winfrey lived with her father and started her media career, she is giving $2 million to NashvilleNurtures, a collaboration with Mount Zion Baptist Church and Tennessee State University, Winfrey’s alma mater. They plan to feed 10,000 families in and around the city.

In Milwaukee, where she lived with her mother, Winfrey is assisting those in need of housing and mental health care with a $100,000 donation to SaintA and The Nia Imani Family, Inc.

In Baltimore, where Winfrey also built her media career, she’s donating money to Living Classrooms Foundation and Center for Urban Families.

She will also give $115,000 to the Boys and Girls Club of East Mississippi.

“I’m not opposed to big organizations dispersing money, but I always like to do the on-the-ground grassroots stuff myself,” she said. “Look, I want to be able to reach people who have been incarcerated and are coming out of prison. I want to reach mothers of domestic violence. I want to reach people. I want to feed people. I want to help people get access to testing.”

Winfrey said she’s been homebound since March 11, four days after she wrapped her nine-city wellness tour that visited arenas like Barclays Center in Brooklyn and the Forum in Inglewood, California.

She announced her COVID-19 Relief Fund last month, initially giving $1 million to America’s Food Fund. She said Wednesday that she will also give grants to advocacy organization Global Citizen, New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in Chicago and Minnie’s Food Pantry in Plano, Texas, among other organizations.

Before giving out millions to others, Winfrey said she first helped the people closest to her.

“The first thing I did was start in my own family, people I knew who were going to be touched and were not going to have jobs. Then I moved out to people who I’ve worked with and known who maybe would be out of work. I started literally here, working my way out, and then into the community. So people who I hadn’t spoken to in years ended up getting checks from me like, ‘What is this?’/p>

“All the cousins and some aunties — try to help your own family first,” she added. “I didn’t want an announcement about, ‘I’m going out into the world trying to help other people’ and then your own family saying, ‘Hey, I can’t pay my light bill. I can’t pay my rent.’”

Last week, Winfrey gave a commencement speech during Facebook’s virtual “Graduation 2020” event, and asked the graduates, “What will your essential service be?” She said she’s asked herself the same question.

“What this pandemic has done is made me think about giving differently. How I give and who’s on the receiving end of that, and how do you do that in such a way that sustains people? I’ve ultimately always believed that you teach people to fish ... but sometimes people just need fish and a piece of bread,” she said. “Sometimes you need some fish, OK? Sometimes you don’t have time to learn to fish. I just need some fish today!”",100,High,Center,USA,1

Special to USA TODAY

If you're worried about losing all those pretax dollars you saved in a flexible spending account this year, relief may be in sight, even if COVID-19 keeps you from visiting the doctor or putting your kids in day care.

FSAs allow employees to set aside money for medical and child care expenses. It’s a careful calculation that allows them to pay for essential care while lowering their taxable income. Like many other aspects of daily life, the coronavirus pandemic is upending those plans.

By mid-April, at least 30 states had placed non-emergency medical and dental visits on hold to contain the spread of COVID-19. While some states have since allowed elective medicare to resume, consumers may be wary and opt to delay procedures. Day care centers in eight states are closed except to children of essential workers as of mid-May, while many others are now slowly reopening or are under restrictions that limit capacity.

If people fail to claim all of the dollars set aside in those accounts by a certain date – typically a few months after the end of a calendar year – they forfeit the money, and the unused funds go to their employers, who are in charge of administering the accounts.

Thanks to a federal coronavirus relief package and new rules from the IRS, you may not have to ""use it or lose it"" when it comes to those saved, pretax dollars. On May 12, the tax agency said it would provide more options for FSAs, including the chance for employees to readjust their contributions.

U.S. representatives from Washington state introduced a bill in Congress that would allow people to roll over their 2020 contributions into 2021, arguing that consumers need flexibility amid the crisis. But for now, the “use it or lose it” rule is in effect.

“We have circumstances now that we couldn’t have expected,” says David Speier, managing director of benefits accounts at Willis Towers Watson. “These are new events that should allow people to rethink what they contribute, whether that's dependent care or a health savings account.”

Here’s what to know about managing your pretax spending accounts during the pandemic:

Health FSAs

Even before the coronavirus swept the globe, Americans weren’t experts at efficiently handling their health FSAs, which allow workers to set aside as much as $2,750 in 2020. The typical user forfeited about $263 in 2019, up from $159 the previous year, according to a study from health savings account company Lively.

While medical offices were shuttered to all but emergency treatments in many states, consumer spending on health care plunged 18% in the first quarter, according to data from the Commerce Department. That may put even more dollars at risk of being forfeited than in a typical year. Some changes from the IRS and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act could help you avoid this.

• The IRS allows employers to reopen their flexible spending accounts. This would allow workers to reduce the amount they set aside. Typically, employees are given one enrollment period in the fall to set aside these dollars for the coming year. There’s a catch: The IRS says it’s up to the employer to reopen FSAs.

• There is more time to claim reimbursements. Employers can allow employees to tap their unused 2019 health FSA money on health care costs incurred through the end of 2020, according to the new IRS rules. That may help some consumers who weren’t able to use all their 2019 funds by the end of their company’s grace period in early 2020, which is typically in mid-March – when the pandemic hit the USA.

• There are more ways to spend your health FSA dollars. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act includes a few tweaks to what consumers can buy with their health FSA dollars. Consumers can use the money to buy over-the-counter drugs without a prescription, as well as feminine hygiene products such as tampons and pads.

“The IRS is trying to create more flexibility,” says Shobin Uralil, co-founder and COO of Lively. “The biggest piece of advice is for employees to ask their employers how their plans are designed to determine whether these changes will take place.”

Employees should be on the lookout for communication from their employers about these plans reopening for new elections, says Speier of Willis Towers Watson.

If you are concerned about spending your dollars, consider taking advantage of telehealth services, which are eligible for reimbursement through FSAs, Uralil recommends.

Dependent care accounts

The IRS has relaxed the rules for these accounts, which allow parents of children younger than 13 to set aside as much as $5,000 to pay for day care, after- or before-school care, summer camps or babysitting. While many child care centers are shuttered – and parents working from home – families may be spending much less than they expected on these expenses.

The new IRS rules allow employers to reopen enrollment for these plans. In that case, parents could reduce the amount they set aside in these accounts, for instance. But the same catch applies as with the health FSAs: It’s up to your employer to make this option available.

Pretax commuting dollars

Don’t forget about pretax plans for commuting expenses, which your employer may offer to help reduce the cost of parking, trains, subways and other commuting costs – expenses that fewer workers are incurring since many employers asked their workers to telecommute amid the pandemic.

These plans don’t have a “use it or lose it” rule, and the money is deducted from your paycheck on a monthly basis. In this case, it’s up to the worker to ask the employer to halt the deductions. Otherwise, you may lose that money.

“If you aren't parking at work, don't forget to shut off your commuter benefits,” Speier says. “If you’ve already paid the parking lot, it's pretty much gone.”

Labor organizers say there have been scores of McDonald's workers with COVID-19 in at least 17 states. They also cite a survey of more than 800 McDonald's workers from March 31 to April 6 in which 42% reported being told not to wear masks and gloves by management. The survey also said 46% came to work feeling sick because they were afraid they would be disciplined or penalized.

The strike is supported by the Service Employees International Union and is being organized by the ""Fight for $15"" minimum-wage labor campaign.

""This is about choices,"" SEIU President Mary Kay Henry said. ""McDonald’s can do the right thing and protect its workers. It is choosing not to.""

The company disputes the allegations by these workers, saying they are not representative of the 850,000 McDonald’s employees nationwide. McDonald’s also called it a strategically timed “publicity stunt” by labor organizers.

Each side planned to take out full-page advertisements in national newspapers this week on the subject of safety at McDonald's restaurants. One ad is scheduled to appear Wednesday in USA TODAY in the form of an open letter to McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski. It was submitted by several public health professionals, including David Michaels, former chief of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

“Reports by McDonald’s crew members and media outlets reveal a pattern of severe shortcomings by McDonald’s under your leadership to fully comply with the highest standards for safety and hygiene at a time when such failures can have deadly consequences for workers, their families, their communities, and your customers,” the letter states.

“We are aware of scores of cases of COVID-19 positive workers in at least 16 states across the country. Time and time again, McDonald’s has failed to swiftly close and disinfect stores following confirmed reports of COVID-19 among employees. To make matters worse, your restaurants have also failed to promptly inform workers of exposure to the virus and to provide pay during quarantine,” the letter continues.

McDonald’s sent its own message Tuesday with an ad in The New York Times. It is planning to open dining rooms at restaurants where permitted and says its 14,000 locally owned restaurants are “putting safety first.” The ad also says that it has more than 50 new procedures that go “well beyond masks and gloves” to keep everyone safe.

McDonald’s vice president for U.S. communications, David Tovar, said restaurants now have an ample amount of cleaning supplies, gloves and masks, and he suggested the employee survey from April was outdated at best. He also said labor actions at McDonald’s so far only have involved a small fraction of the workforce.

Henry of the SEIU said these are widespread issues.

""I don’t think there would be strikes happening on 20 cities all on the same day (Wednesday) if this was not a widely experienced condition of all workers in fast-food restaurants,"" she said.

A group of strikers also plans to hold a Zoom meeting with Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday to discuss their ongoing efforts to hold McDonald’s accountable during the pandemic.

Since March, employees in some cities have conducted walkouts to protest McDonald’s response to COVID-19. Wednesday’s action is billed by organizers as the first coordinated nationwide strike.

“The way work is set up right now at McDonald’s, the workers are at increased risk for transmission of COVID-19, and there are reported cases of COVID-19 among workers, which is not surprising considering the conditions that have been reported to me,” said Michaels, an epidemiologist.

Michaels said he was approached by some of the workers and has agreed to advise them as an unpaid expert.

“Are their demands reasonable?” Michaels asked. “I think they are.”

The strikers want McDonald’s to halt dividends and instead use that money for increased safety and economic protections for workers, including “pandemic pay of $15X2,” plus paid sick leave and sufficient protective gear for workers. They also want immediate store closures when workers become infected to allow for a deep cleaning, contact tracing and self-quarantine for two weeks at full pay.

The workers cite a number of examples in various cities about the lack of protective gear or inadequate response to sickness among workers. In San Francisco, workers filed a complaint alleging managers told them not to worry about a lack of masks in the store, suggesting they use coffee filters instead.

Tovar of McDonald's said the company has strict social distancing guidelines and takes safety seriously for customers and employees. He said there have been less than 10 restaurants out of the 14,000 in the country ""that have had any type of activity like this that’s been orchestrated by the SEIU.""

""That’s not to say there aren’t real issues and concerns that are out there, as we’re all dealing with this terrible pandemic,"" he said. ""But the feedback that we get from thousands of employees does not match (what the SEIU says).""

The worker experience can vary by location. In Los Angeles, longtime McDonald’s cook Bartolome Perez makes $14.25 an hour and says he’s seen his hours reduced after speaking up previously about the working conditions. He plans to strike Wednesday.

“They only care for their profits,” he said. “They don’t care for our lives. They show it to us again and again.”

The move comes at a time when millions of Americans have been laid off and had their household income slashed due to the coronavirus fallout. The situation is particularly dire for people with low-wage jobs that cannot be performed at home.

Nearly 37 million Americans were food insecure in 2018. That number could rise by 17.1 million in the wake of the pandemic, according to Feeding America.

Harnessing today's technology to the task of fighting the coronavirus pandemic is turning out to be more complicated than it first appeared.

The first U.S. states that rolled out smartphone apps for tracing the contacts of COVID-19 patients are dealing with technical glitches and a general lack of interest by their residents. A second wave of tech-assisted pandemic surveillance tools is on its way, this time with the imprimatur of tech giants Apple and Google. But those face their own issues, among them potential accuracy problems and the fact that they won't share any information with governments that could help track the spread of the illness.

Contact tracing is a pillar of infection control. It's traditionally conducted by trained public health workers who interview those who may have been exposed, then urge them to get tested and isolate themselves. Some estimates call for as many as 300,000 U.S. workers to do the work effectively, but so far those efforts have lagged.

Apple is reopening some stores this week:Expect to wear a mask, have temperature checked

More:Apple, Google will warn you if you've been exposed to COVID-19. Here's how.

Other tech companies like Salesforce have offered database tools to assist manual tracing efforts, although those also raise privacy concerns because of the need to collect and store detailed information about people's social connections, health status and whereabouts.

Privacy concerns over tracking

Privacy advocates warn that the danger of creating new government surveillance powers for the pandemic could lead to much bigger problems in the future. In a new policy paper shared with The Associated Press, the American Civil Liberties Union is warning state governments to tread more carefully and establish stricter privacy procedures before deploying technology meant to detect and curb new coronavirus outbreaks.

Even the most privacy-minded tools, such as those to be released soon by Apple and Google, require constraints so that they don't become instruments of surveillance or oppression. ""The risks of getting it wrong are enormous,"" said Neema Singh Guliani, a senior legislative counsel with the ACLU.

ACLU's report says the worst location-tracking technology should be rejected outright, such as apps that track individual movements via satellite-based GPS technology and feed sensitive personal data into centralized government databases. ""Good designs don't require you to gather people's location information and store that,"" Singh Guliani said.

She urged governments to set rules addressing both privacy and efficacy so that surveillance tools don't interfere with more conventional public health methods.

Utah, North Dakota and South Dakota were the first U.S. states to launch voluntary phone apps that enable public health departments to track the location and connections of people who test positive for the coronavirus. But governors haven't had much luck getting the widespread participation needed for them to work effectively.

The state with the highest known rate of participation so far is South Dakota, where last week about 2% of residents had the Care19 app on their phones. Last week was also the first time it recorded a single infection. The same app is getting even less support in North Dakota.

""This is a red state,"" said Crystal Wolfrum, a paralegal in Minot, North Dakota, who says she's one of the only people among her neighbors and friends to download the app. ""They don't want to wear masks. They don't want to be told what to do. A lot of people I talk to are, like, 'Nope, you're not going to track me.' ""

Wolfrum said she's doubtful that the app will be useful, both because of people's wariness and its poor performance. She gave it a bad review on Google's app store after it failed to notice lengthy shopping trips she made one weekend to Walmart and Target stores.

North Dakota is now looking at starting a second app based on the Apple-Google technology. ""It was rushed to market,"" because of the urgent need, Vern Dosch, the state's contact tracing facilitator, told KFYR-TV in Bismarck. ""We knew that it wouldn't be perfect.""

Tracking without revealing identity

The ACLU is taking a more measured approach to the Apple and Google method, which will use Bluetooth wireless technology to automatically notify people about potential COVID-19 exposure without revealing anyone's identity to the government.

But even if the app is described as voluntary and personal health information never leaves the phone, the ACLU says it's important for governments to set additional safeguards to ensure that businesses and public agencies don't make showing the app a condition of access to jobs, public transit, grocery stores and other services.

Among the governments experimenting with the Apple-Google approach are the state of Washington and several European countries.

Swiss epidemiologist Marcel Salathé said all COVID-19 apps so far are ""fundamentally broken"" because they collect too much irrelevant information and don't work well with Android and iPhone operating software. Salathé authored a paper favoring the privacy-protecting approach that the tech giants have since adopted, and he considers it the best hope for a tool that could actually help isolate infected people before they show symptoms and spread the disease.

""You will remember your work colleagues but you will not remember the random person next to you on a train or really close to you at the bar,"" he said.

Other U.S. governors are looking at technology designed to supplement manual contact-tracing efforts. As early as this week, Rhode Island has said it is set to launch a contact-tracing database system mostly built by software giant Salesforce, which has said it is also working with Massachusetts, California, Louisiana and New York City on a similar approach.

Salesforce says it can use data-management software to help trained crews trace ""relationships across people, places and events"" and identify virus clusters down to the level of a neighborhood hardware store. It will rely on manual input of information gathered through conversations by phone, text or email.

""It's only as good as a lot of us using it,"" Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo said at a news conference last week. ""If 10% of Rhode Island's population opts in, this won't be effective."" The state hasn't yet outlined what people are expected to opt into.

Harnessing today's technology to the task of fighting the coronavirus pandemic is turning out to be more complicated than it first appeared.

The first U.S. states that rolled out smartphone apps for tracing the contacts of COVID-19 patients are dealing with technical glitches and a general lack of interest by their residents. A second wave of tech-assisted pandemic surveillance tools is on its way, this time with the imprimatur of tech giants Apple and Google. But those face their own issues, among them potential accuracy problems and the fact that they won't share any information with governments that could help track the spread of the illness.

Contact tracing is a pillar of infection control. It's traditionally conducted by trained public health workers who interview those who may have been exposed, then urge them to get tested and isolate themselves. Some estimates call for as many as 300,000 U.S. workers to do the work effectively, but so far those efforts have lagged.

Apple is reopening some stores this week:Expect to wear a mask, have temperature checked

More:Apple, Google will warn you if you've been exposed to COVID-19. Here's how.

Other tech companies like Salesforce have offered database tools to assist manual tracing efforts, although those also raise privacy concerns because of the need to collect and store detailed information about people's social connections, health status and whereabouts.

Privacy concerns over tracking

Privacy advocates warn that the danger of creating new government surveillance powers for the pandemic could lead to much bigger problems in the future. In a new policy paper shared with The Associated Press, the American Civil Liberties Union is warning state governments to tread more carefully and establish stricter privacy procedures before deploying technology meant to detect and curb new coronavirus outbreaks.

Even the most privacy-minded tools, such as those to be released soon by Apple and Google, require constraints so that they don't become instruments of surveillance or oppression. ""The risks of getting it wrong are enormous,"" said Neema Singh Guliani, a senior legislative counsel with the ACLU.

ACLU's report says the worst location-tracking technology should be rejected outright, such as apps that track individual movements via satellite-based GPS technology and feed sensitive personal data into centralized government databases. ""Good designs don't require you to gather people's location information and store that,"" Singh Guliani said.

She urged governments to set rules addressing both privacy and efficacy so that surveillance tools don't interfere with more conventional public health methods.

But where are they going?

Travelers have been using the short-term rental service to explore online experiences in the interim. But travel won't be stuck online forever.

Guests are adding homes to their Airbnb wish lists from all over the world. The top 10 most wish-listed homes, from March to early May, include stays in Indonesia, Brazil and Greece. Lines in their descriptions touch on the escape travelers are looking for worldwide:

Singaraja, Bali, Indonesia: ""The villa sits in an elevated postion in one of the last remaining untouched parts of the island.""

Santa Catarina, Brazil: ""Come for a weekend, a week, two weeks, a month or more… This property is natural and beautiful: you will not regret it.""

Santorini, Greece: ""The private veranda offers a private space for relaxing, dinning, or even sunbathing, having as a background the most breathtaking views of Santorini: the Volcano, the caldera cliff and Thirassia Island.""

What might they be celebrating? Data from the last 60 days shows a swath of keywords indicating guests might be looking to recreate special occasions, not to mention enjoy warmer weather. Popular keywords include beach, getaway, birthday/bday, wedding, honeymoon and anniversary.

As for what type of place guests might want to stay in: In early May alone, U.S. users have been increasingly searching for cabins. Of the top 10 most wish-listed space types around the world, they are the fastest-growing category. Cabins are likely of interest to travelers given the private settings and proximity, given a road trip to a cabin is much less of a hassle than heading to an airport right now.

What to do if you are booking a short-term rental on Airbnb, other services during coronavirus pandemic

You might have questions regarding your next short-term rental stay during the coronavirus pandemic. Are people even going right now? Is it safe to stay there? What do I need to know before I go?

Before you get to any of that, make sure you're aware of the basics – including how to cancel (or book) your stay if you're wary of traveling or can't get there because of travel restrictions because of the pandemic.

If you have a short-term rental booked for this summer or are planning to book, first check cancellation policies. Is it eligible for a refund or rebooking? If so, for how far out? Remember that if you booked through a third-party site, you may have to abide by their rules.

Keep checking websites if the date you booked isn't eligible for a refund just yet as the hospitality industry has been updating cancellation policies frequently because of the pandemic. Airbnb, for example, has extended the eligibility for certain guests to seek refunds.

With short-term rentals, you may have to work with both the company and the host to get a refund or rebooking. These extra steps in the process have been challenging for consumers and hosts alike, though the companies are also hurting.

Americans want our country to open up safely.

We have been at this for a number of difficult weeks since the global coronavirus pandemic began, and it has taken a toll.

It has been a time of unprecedented challenge. To our health. To our jobs. To our social connections. To our health care communities.

We have sacrificed with great unity to #StayHome in order to reduce the infection rate and save lives.

We want a sense of normalcy back — to go to work, to go to restaurants, to see sports again, to send our kids to school, to hug our families — but not at the expense of the lives of our friends, families and neighbors.

We want a good economy and public safety, but we are afraid if we open too quickly, or don’t have plans to adjust if spread recurs, we will have neither.

We don’t believe we need to wait until everything is completely perfect or there is zero risk before we open again. The reality is that many states are already taking the first steps toward opening, and this must happen in the safest way possible.

Americans should still #StayHome whenever possible and continue social distancing. Now we need to get on a path to #OpenSafely that gets it right.

Still growing, contagious and lethal

COVID-19 is still spreading, but at a steadier rate. While it is shrinking in places like New York, it is still growing rapidly in some areas where there had been fewer cases. The virus is still equally contagious. The virus is still lethal to many. The virus still spreads through unsuspecting asymptomatic people. Some places are especially hard hit: nursing homes, meatpacking plants, prisons, detention centers, public housing, and the communities around them as people move in and out. People are still dying at an alarming rate, and that will continue unless we follow the path like the one outlined by Dr. Deborah Birx at the White House: a steady, gated reopening that avoids accelerated growth in cases, hospitalizations and deaths.

Tens of millions of Americans are now out of work. Many businesses have closed; others are in danger. Americans are facing hunger and the inability to pay their rent or mortgage at levels not seen here since the Great Depression. Congress and the administration have passed laws to support Americans through this, but support isn’t the same thing as a job. And the support still leaves voids that need to be filled.

Yet opening the country before we have the conditions like those outlined in the White House plan can put Americans at risk unless we take further steps. It won’t help the economy if we end up having to pull back hard or close again because the virus starts spreading toward the point where it threatens our health care systems and further disrupts our health. The things that will bring us back — consumer spending, business hiring, signing leases, travel and capital investment — won’t happen unless Americans feel confident they can do these things without a substantial risk of harm to themselves or their loved ones from getting and spreading COVID-19.

We are asking decision-makers at all levels to #OpenSafely — to move along the path of opening up our communities again as deliberately as necessary and as quickly as can be safely accomplished.

Opening up safely means:

►Following the plan laid out by Dr. Birx to begin opening communities up with two weeks of declining case counts and the other gating criteria met — or explaining how there is an alternative plan for containment if that condition is not met.

►Creating adequate diagnostic testing availability so that people who need a test can get one — particularly people with symptoms, and those without symptoms in high-risk settings like nursing homes, prisons and meatpacking plants.

►Implementing improved safety standards and protocols to avoid outbreaks and slow spreading in potential hot spots.

►Having adequate public health infrastructure to contact trace and offer voluntary isolation to contain the virus when it is detected — not necessarily to trace all cases successfully, but enough to minimize potential outbreak clusters and keep getting better over time.

►Protecting vulnerable and at-risk populations and hard-hit communities, and not putting essential workers at needless risk.

►Obtaining sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect our first responders and health care workforce, including by expanding access to testing in the community

Pause if care capacity is threatened

As the reopening process begins and moves forward, states should be carefully monitoring hospitalization trends and their hospital capacity. If the rise in cases is on track to threaten hospitals’ capacity to care for COVID-19 or other acutely ill patients in the state, states should immediately take steps to slow or pause reopening efforts. The lag between infection and serious complications is typically eight days or more, so there is little time to wait if such trends emerge.

Additional important areas to make progress on that will reduce risk of transmission and support continued opening up:

►Widespread use of high-quality masks.

►Surge capacity in the health care system with sufficient PPE to protect health care workers.

►Evidence-based mitigation measures and screenings in offices and public spaces, using guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or comparable ones.

►Controls at major air and rail entry points.

►Continuous monitoring at the state and county level for indications of potential emerging outbreaks, including symptom-checking apps, digital thermometers and other syndromic surveillance tools as they become available.

►Test, trace and isolate most active cases and their closest contacts, using vacant hotel space where necessary.

►Coordinated response with neighboring states.

►Widespread use of telemedicine to improve health care access and reduce the use of PPE.

►Readiness to respond quickly to new community spread.

Safest to carefully open up

Areas that can most safely open up (with appropriate distancing and risk mitigation steps) if states have met the Dr. Birx gating criteria but have not yet initiated the reopening process are:

►Doctor offices, clinics and surgery centers with sufficient community PPE.

►Workplaces like retail and manufacturing.

►Parks and other outdoor recreation, lakes, gardens and bike trails.

►Shopping areas and coffee shops where people don’t congregate in large numbers or for extended periods.

►Outdoor weddings and funerals with small groups that physically distance and wear masks when close together.

Additional areas that we hope can open up successfully under significantly modified conditions, but that will benefit from further technical assessment on how processes should be modified that would allow them to operate with lower risks:

►Day care centers

►Summer camps and youth sports

►Restaurants

►Schools

►Movie theaters and small entertainment venues

►Sporting events with very limited or no crowds

►TV and film production

►Colleges and universities

►Bars

Areas that should remain closed until risks can be significantly reduced:

►Large-scale events like concerts, sports with high attendance

►Large conventions and other activities involving significant travel and congregation

We believe these lists can be refined and adjusted locally based on conditions, proximity to hot spots, density and other factors.

We are asking public officials and decision-makers to #OpenSafely by quickly getting the conditions in place so we can move forward. We are encouraged that other countries, including Germany, Italy and New Zealand, as well as parts of the United States, are implementing strategies to begin to open safely and closely monitor a step-by-step opening. We believe a safe step-by-step opening can happen across the United States.

We believe Americans want to remain united in the fight against COVID-19, as we were in the initial response after 9/11. We can overcome this epidemic with smart policies and committed actions.

Opinion contributor

My son was born at 6:57 a.m. Of course, I’m not the only parent who remembers the precise moment their child entered the world, but the reason that time sticks in my brain has as much to do with what else took place that morning. One hour and 49 minutes after his birth, the first plane hit the World Trade Center's North Tower.

His birth was unremarkable, thankfully, and once mother and son were comfortably relocated from the delivery room to their recovery room, I took advantage of the first lull of my morning to dash down to the hospital cafeteria to grab a breakfast sandwich and coffee to go. By the time the elevator had returned me to the 5th floor, a crowd had gathered around the small television mounted on the ceiling of the maternity wing vestibule.

On the screen a bright orange fire raged against the sharpest, bluest sky I had ever seen and people were murmuring, shifting from one foot to the other, glancing uncomfortably toward the window on the other side of the room. Nobody quite knew what was going on and what might happen next.

When the second plane hit 17 minutes later it brought, among other nightmarish things, a cold clarity. By the time I made it back to the recovery room, America had changed. The world my son had been born into, just two hours earlier, was gone.

Making sense of a shattered world

It was for this reason I decided to write my son a letter. I would describe the events of that day in the hope that years later, he would understand just a bit better the world he had been born into as well as the one he navigated through in the ensuing years. Each year on his birthday I would write another letter, summarizing both the accomplishments and milestones of his life achieved during the previous 12 months along with the goings-on in the larger world. I would, I told myself, present him with these letters all at once, 19 years later, in August 2020, when he was packing up for college.

When I made this decision, August 2020 seemed so far away. I couldn’t imagine we’d ever get there, although I knew it would arrive with a head of steam, carrying the detritus of what had been wrought the terrible morning of his birth that was still, nevertheless, a guiltily wonderful morning for my wife and me, despite it all. What would the world look like in 2020? Who could possibly know?

The fascination of finding out how we got from here to there was overwhelming for me, so I was determined to keep my promise to myself and write that letter every September 11th. And I did.

August 2020 doesn’t seem so far away right now. For my son, the excitement and anticipation brought by college acceptance letters have now been replaced with angst that he won’t be going away to college in late summer as planned but would instead be stuck in his childhood bedroom, faced with the unappetizing choice of either starting the next phase of his life on Zoom or deferring college completely until some indeterminate time in the future, a time that seems farther off every day.

Virtual classrooms, real-life lessons:All I really need to know in life I learned from my kid’s online kindergarten

After years of breathless waiting for this life-changing moment to arrive, he’s now hoping against hope that time slows down, allowing the world to settle and recover before snatching this moment away from him. Yes, I know that others have it worse and as long as we remain healthy we should count our blessings. We do. But that doesn’t mean we can’t mourn a loss that amounts to something short of death.

For years, America went off course

When I go through my collection of letters, I see with crystal clarity how, in fact, we got from there to here. On his first birthday, I told him about how he loved to crawl and play with our dog Clarence, but also about the Enron scandal and the collapse of the dot.com bubble. On his second birthday, right above the taped ticket stub of his first Phillies game, I mentioned the Iraq War and how the stock market had rebounded as a result. The Dow had risen from 8611 in my '02 letter to 9420 in my '03 letter. War, it seemed, was good business.

My '04 letter focused largely on the birth of our daughter and my son’s cool reception to the reality that the spotlight was no longer his alone. It also remarked on the fact that “the Bush administration has succeeded in so thoroughly scaring the hell out of the American public that they’ll believe anything done in the name of national security, even if it makes no sense.” It also noted that Donald Trump’s “The Apprentice” was the breakout television hit of the year.

Each year’s letter provided another link in the chain. Then-Sen. John Kerry, running as a peacenik in '04, had no shot to stop another four years of President George W. Bush’s militarization of America, I wrote. In '05 I wrote that Hurricane Katrina showed us just how unprepared we were as a nation to handle a calamity. Worse, as the messes in both the Middle East and New Orleans grew, we watched the truth become little more than a pawn to be played in a game with monumental stakes.

“The sad thing about America since you were born,” I wrote to my son on Sept. 11, 2006, “is that many people no longer trust anything that is told to us.” And on and on.

Restrictions aren't always safe:A century after Prohibition, will the coronavirus finally end it? We'll drink to that.

On the 10th anniversary of 9/11, I wrote that the day was commemorated with Stealth fighter jets flying over football stadiums and overheated praise of the armed forces. “There was a lot of talk about the ‘heroes’ of 9/11 but not much about who these heroes actually were,” I wrote. “What 9/11 stands for, if anything, continues to be open to debate.” It was a confusing day, I admitted. Nobody knew what to do or what to say. So our nation decided to laud the military in the desperate hope that it would protect us from any future catastrophe. Defense expenditures exploded along with the praise, as countless other governmental functions were marginalized, if not ignored or dismantled completely.

Now we know that the military couldn’t protect us from everything. A virus is impervious to multimillion dollar fighter jets — but perhaps not to a fully functional and funded federal government well-staffed with medical and scientific experts. They might have prevented this world, shattered on the day of my son’s birth, from disintegrating into dust under his feet once again, this time upon the occasion of his high school graduation.

My son was born on 9/11 and will now graduate high school in his bedroom in the midst of the most horrific global pandemic of our lifetimes. The world broke on the day of his birth, and the fissures from that day caused it to crack wide open right before he was to head off to college. And I have the letters to prove it.

COVID-19 has infected nearly 5 million people globally and killed almost 323,000. It can devastate a range of organ systems, including the lungs, the kidneys and the cardiovascular system.

But for those who get very sick and are lucky enough to recover, the virus carries another potential danger — to mental health. Hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 survivors could be at risk for symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. As the number of infections continues to rise steadily, this potential hazard will also grow.

We have long known that being critically ill can lead to symptoms of PTSD, including chronic fear, arousal and avoidance. The reasons for this are complex. Having a life-threatening illness that requires intensive care can be terrifying. These patients are facing the possibility of their own death in a situation in which they have ceded control of their own bodies to strangers, often in painful or unpleasant ways. They often can’t move, they are intubated, and they receive medications that make them feel sick or cause them to drift in and out of consciousness.

This nightmarish experience is often the everyday reality of being hospitalized with serious illness. These patients can also fall into a delirium and, after they recover, they are disturbed by vivid memories of these hallucinations and misperceptions.

Brains primed to remember trauma

It also appears that being critically ill, particularly with severe infections that cause inflammation, can prime the brain to remember traumatic experiences. The brains of many of these patients are deluged with adrenaline, the fight-or-flight neurotransmitter. After all, what is more urgent than trying to stay alive? Adrenaline activates the amygdala, the fear center of the brain. When this happens, a person’s memories tend to be strongly encoded. This is a key reason that people tend to remember so much about traumatic experiences.

Many seriously ill patients can also experience a burst of inflammatory chemicals that triggers an additional adrenaline spike. On top of that, many of these patients suffer a dangerous drop in blood pressure, which is often treated with, you guessed it, a shot of adrenaline. As a result, many seriously ill people, including those with COVID-19, have very high levels of adrenaline, which likely affects how they experience the already distressing ordeal of being sick in the hospital.

As a psychiatrist who often sees survivors of critical illness, I am very familiar with these problems. In some ways, being seriously ill can resemble combat, another common cause of PTSD: In both cases, people feel extreme fear, intense arousal and a sense — often quite accurate — that they have little control over their own fate.

Given these circumstances, it makes sense that many hospitalized COVID-19 patients could be at risk for PTSD symptoms once they recover. The problem may be exacerbated because most hospitals are not allowing any visitors for these patients, so most of them must suffer alone, without family or friends.

Research suggests that PTSD symptoms are particularly common in people who survive acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, in which the lungs fill with fluid and breathing becomes difficult. Oxygen is central to life, and we have evolved to prize it intensely. Anyone who has gotten something caught in their throat knows how terrifying this feeling is. Now imagine that sensation lasting for days or weeks.

It cannot be ignored:During coronavirus isolation, treating mental health issues through telemedicine is vital

Of course, ARDS is a hallmark of severe COVID-19. Many such patients must be attached to ventilators in order to breathe. A tube is inserted deep into their throats, which can give them the sensation of being choked. Often, these patients must be sedated and restrained to keep them from pulling the tube out in a panic.

The problem may extend beyond the hospital. The health care system has been stretched so thin that many COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms don’t go to the hospital at all. Some describe struggling over days to breathe freely. This group could also be at risk for persistent emotional effects.

Don't overlook PTSD after COVID-19

Because COVID-19 is so new, there is little research on its mental health consequences. A study of over 700 COVID-19 patients by Chinese researchers, published in March in the journal Psychological Medicine, found that an astounding 96% of them had significant PTSD symptoms during quarantine. This rate is much higher than what researchers typically find for non-COVID critical illness survivors. Most researchers agree that 20% to 25% of such patients end up with PTSD symptoms.

The high rate found in the Chinese study could be due in part to the fact that these patients were quarantined for weeks in hospitals, apart from family and friends. The United States has not used this strict approach. Nevertheless, not all of these patients had a serious illness. In that region of China, anyone who tested positive for COVID-19, whatever their symptoms, was quarantined.

A second crisis:Mental illness is epidemic within the coronavirus pandemic

PTSD after critical illness is treatable, with strategies similar to those used for PTSD triggered by other circumstances. For many patients, a combination of medication and psychotherapy can, over time, ease or eliminate symptoms. But because the problem remains unfamiliar to many doctors, including most psychiatrists, many of these patients don’t receive the help they need.

It is impossible to know how many Americans will ultimately be infected with COVID. But as the partial reopening continues, the number will likely stretch into the millions. Not all of these people will become seriously ill, of course, but many will. One recent paper from the Annals of Internal Medicine estimated that about 9% of patients infected with COVID-19 require intensive care. Of those, tens or perhaps hundreds of thousands could end up with symptoms of PTSD.

Over the coming months and years, we will need to make sure that we focus on the mental health of these patients, providing the support they need to recover, not only physically but emotionally as well.

Food prices soar to highest one-month increase since '74; eggs up 16% in April

Grocery store bills shot up April, showing the biggest monthly increase in nearly 50 years, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistic's monthly Consumer Price Index report.

While overall the April CPI declined 0.8%, consumers on average paid 2.6% more for groceries. It's the largest one-month increase since February 1974. During the last 12 months, grocery prices rose 4.1%.

Price increases in the meat, poultry, fish and egg category were the steepest. Egg prices had the biggest jump as consumers paid 16.1% more in April than in March for eggs. Prices for eggs, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) were as high as $3 a dozen in April.

New York's MTA to use UV light to disinfect subways, buses

Transit officials in New York announced a new program to disinfect subways and buses relying on the power of ultraviolet light to kill the new coronavirus.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority will spend roughly $1 million on 150 UV lamps used to disinfect trains and buses, the agency announced Tuesday.

'What in God's name is he doing?': Biden rips Trump for saying he uses hydroxychloroquine

Former Vice President Joe Biden criticized President Donald Trump for saying he uses hydroxychloroquine, a drug unproven to treat or prevent the new coronavirus.

""It's like saying maybe if you injected Clorox into your blood, you know it may cure you. Come on, man. What is he doing? What in God's name is he doing?"" Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said during a virtual Yahoo News town hall. ""The things the president say, the words of a president, matter.""

Biden worried that people may hear Trump's comments and start using the drug themselves. The Food and Drug Administration has warned against improper use of the drug for COVID-19 outside a hospital or clinical trial setting, citing evidence that the drug could have potentially fatal side effects.

""Look, this is absolutely irresponsible. There's no serious medical personnel out there saying to use that drug. It's counterproductive. It's not going to help,"" Biden said.

After scientist fired, Florida gov. calls coronavirus data manipulation charge a 'nonissue'

Facing an explosive charge that his administration is manipulating coronavirus data to help make the case for reopening Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis played down the controversy Tuesday as a “nonissue.”

The accusations levied by Rebekah Jones, a data expert at the Florida Department of Health, could undercut the governor’s reopening push, which he has called a “safe” and “step by step” approach despite its COVID-19 death toll topping 2,000 Tuesday.

Jones wrote in an email last week that she no longer was overseeing the state’s COVID-19 dashboard, which she built and managed for two months. She wrote that she ""would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency.""

But DeSantis said at a Tuesday news conference that Jones sent an email to her supervisor saying the comments were being misinterpreted.

Jones told Florida Today that she was fired on Monday. And she said in an email to the CBS12 television station in West Palm Beach that she faced blowback because she refused to ""manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.""

DeSantis spokeswoman Helen Aguirre Ferré, in a separate statement after the news conference, said Jones was fired for ""insubordination.""

CDC quietly releases longer, detailed reopening guidance: reports

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quietly published a longer 60-page document providing guidance to businesses, restaurants, schools and other establishments on how to reopen while minimizing the risk of spreading the virus, CNN and Politico reported.

The document comes after the agency had released six one-page documents and faced criticism amid reports that the Trump administration shelved the longer, more detailed reopening guidance for being too specific.

Politico and CNN reported Trump administration officials delayed the release of the document because of references to religious organizations that they feared were being unfairly targeted. References to faith-based groups were removed from the final 60-page document, an unnamed CDC official told CNN.

Michigan conservative group to hold 'Operation Haircut' on Capitol lawn

The Michigan Conservative Coalition, an organization intended to shape policy and help more conservatives win election, will hold what it's calling Operation Haircut outside the Capitol on Wednesday. They will protest Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's stay-at-home order and the closing of barbershops and hair salons.

“Michigan’s small business owners are patriotic and law-abiding citizens but enough is enough,” said Marian Sheridan, a co-founder of the group, who added that marijuana dispensaries remain open but ""barber shops are, somehow, unsafe.""

Michigan State Police did not immediately disclose how they would react to the event. Organizers said those attending ""will be encouraged to comply with social distancing and other safe practices,"" such as wearing masks, but people providing haircuts would not be able to remain six feet away from people getting them, as required by the order.

Donald Trump calls high number of US coronavirus cases a ‘badge of honor'

President Donald Trump on Tuesday called the number of COVID-19 cases in the United States – the highest in the world – a “badge of honor,” arguing the still-increasing number of cases is simply evidence the country is testing more people.

“By the way, you know, when you say that we lead in cases, that’s because we have more testing than anybody else,” the president said at the White House. “When we have a lot of cases, I don’t look at that as a bad thing. I look at that in a certain respect as being a good thing, because it means our testing is much better. So, if we were testing a million people instead of 14 million people, it would have far few cases, right?""

The U.S. has performed more than 12 million tests, according to the Covid Tracking Project. However, the country still faces testing shortages after months of hurdles in development and access.

McDonald's workers in 20 cities set to strike over lack of COVID-19 protections

Hundreds of McDonald’s workers in 20 cities plan to strike Wednesday, the day before the company’s annual shareholders meeting, as part of an effort to pressure the fast-food chain into improving what they say are inadequate protections for employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Labor organizers say scores of McDonald's workers in at least 16 states have COVID-19. A survey of more than 800 workers, organizers say, found 42% reported being told not to wear protective gear by management and 46% said they came to work feeling sick because they were afraid they would be disciplined or penalized.

The strike is supported by the Service Employees International Union and is being organized by the ""Fight for $15"" minimum-wage labor campaign.

The company disputes the allegations.

US extends border closures to Canada, Mexico until June 22 amid coronavirus

Travelers looking to make a trip to Canada or Mexico will have to wait another 30 days as the Department of Homeland Security extended border closures to curb COVID-19 infections.

Chad Wolf, the acting Secretary of Homeland Security, announced Tuesday that the U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico land border closure has been extended until June 22.

The U.S. and Canada first limited travel in March for a period of 30 days after President Donald Trump and Trudeau agreed to close the border to help contain the spread of coronavirus. In Mexico, the U.S. limited travel in March for a period of 30 days after Trump said the country agreed to close the border to help stem the spread of the coronavirus.

Mnuchin: 'No workers should give their lives' to boost GDP, stock market

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said no worker should die in order to boost the U.S. economy. Mnuchin was responding to a question in an exchange with Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, during a hearing on the coronavirus relief legislation.

""How many workers should give their lives to increase the GDP or the Dow by 1,000 points?"" Brown asked.

""No workers should give their lives to do that, Senator, and I think your characterization is unfair,"" Mnuchin replied.

Mnuchin also faced sharp questioning from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., about whether companies would have to keep employees on their payrolls if they received aid from a joint Fed-Treasury program. “You’re boosting your Wall Street buddies,"" Warren told the secretary when he declined to comment.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified Tuesday that the Fed and Congress ""may need to do more"" to help revive the economy.

Coronavirus lockdowns have caused a whopping drop in carbon emissions

The coronavirus lockdowns have had an “extreme” effect on daily carbon emissions, causing a whopping 17% drop globally during peak confinement measures by early April – levels last seen in 2006.

However, it is unlikely to last, according to a new analysis by an international team of scientists published in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature Climate Change.

This is the first analysis to measure the pandemic-driven global drop in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from January to April of this year.

While the impact of lockdown measures is likely to lead to the largest annual decrease in emissions since the end of World War II, 2020 is still on track to be one of the five hottest years on record, and the study notes that these reductions are no “silver lining.”

The Hechinger Report

This story about education software was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education. Sign up for the Hechinger newsletter.

Coronavirus school closures in all 50 states sent educators and parents scrambling to find online learning resources to keep kids busy and productive at home. Website traffic to the homepage for IXL, a popular tool that lets students practice skills across five subjects through online quizzes, spiked in March. Same for Matific, which gives students math practice tailored to their skill level, and Edgenuity, which develops online courses.

All three of these companies try to hook prospective users with claims on their websites about their products’ effectiveness. Matific boasts that its game-based activities are “proven to help increase results by 34 percent.” IXL says its program is “proven effective” and that research “has shown over and over that IXL produces real results.” Edgenuity boasts that the first case study in its long list of “success stories” shows how 10th grade students using its program “demonstrated more than an eightfold increase in pass rates on state math tests.”

These descriptions of education technology research may comfort educators and parents looking for ways to mitigate the effects of lost learning time because of the coronavirus. But they are all misleading.

None of the studies behind IXL’s or Matific’s research claims were designed well enough to offer reliable evidence of their products’ effectiveness, according to a team of researchers at Johns Hopkins University who catalog effective educational programs. And Edgenuity’s boast takes credit for substantial test score gains that preceded the use of its online classes.

Misleading research claims are increasingly common in the world of ed tech. In 2002, federal education law began requiring schools to spend federal money only on research-based products. As more schools went online and demand for education software grew, more companies began designing and commissioning their own studies about their products. But with little accountability to make sure companies conduct quality research and describe it accurately, they’ve been free to push the limits as they try to hook principals and administrators.

This problem has only been exacerbated by the coronavirus, as widespread school closures have forced districts to turn to online learning. Many educators have been making quick decisions about what products to lean on as they try to provide remote learning options for students during school closures.

Coronavirus learning:Is online school program backed by Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg the answer?

A Hechinger Report review found dozens of companies promote their products’ effectiveness on their websites, in email pitches and in vendor brochures with little evidence or shoddy backing to support their claims. Some companies are trying to gain a foothold in a crowded market. Others sell some of the most widely used education software in schools today.

Many companies claim that their products have “dramatic” and “proven” results. In some cases, they tout student growth that their own studies admit is not statistically significant. Others claim their studies found effects that independent evaluators say didn’t exist. Sometimes these companies make hyperbolic claims of effectiveness based on a kernel of truth from one study, even though the results haven’t been reproduced consistently.

The Matific study that found a 34% increase in student achievement, for instance, includes a major caveat: “It is not possible to claim whether or how much the use of Matific influenced this outcome as students would be expected to show some growth when exposed to teaching, regardless of what resources are used.”

IXL’s research simply compares state test scores in schools where more than 70% of students use their program with state test scores in other schools. This analysis ignores other initiatives happening in those schools and the characteristics of the teachers and students that might influence performance.

About those teachers... They wanted respect. It only took a coronavirus pandemic and worldwide economic collapse

Edgenuity boasts of contributing to an eightfold increase in the rate of 10th graders' passing state math tests at Altamont High School in Utah. But the claim is based on measuring growth starting two years before the school introduced Edgenuity, rather than just one year before. Over two years of actually using Edgenuity, 11th grade pass rates dropped in the featured school, ninth grade pass rates fell and then recovered, and 10th grade pass rates doubled — a significantly less impressive achievement than the one the company highlights.

Matific did not respond to repeated requests for comment. IXL declined to comment on critiques that its studies weren’t adequately designed to make conclusions about the impact of its program on student test scores. And Edgenuity agreed it shouldn’t have calculated student growth the way it did and said it would edit its case study, though at the time of publication the misleading data still topped its list of “success stories.”

More than $12 billion spent on these programs

When shoddy ed tech research leads educators to believe programs might really help their students, there are consequences for schools as well as taxpayers. Districts spent more than $12 billion on ed tech in 2019.

In some places, principals and administrators consider themselves well-equipped to assess research claims, ignore the bunk and choose promising products. But many people making the decisions are not trained in statistics or rigorous study design. They don’t have the skills to assess whether promising findings with one group of students may realistically translate to their own buildings. And, perhaps most importantly, they often don’t have the time or resources to conduct follow-up studies in their own classrooms to assess whether the products paid for with public money actually worked.

“We’re spending a ton of money,” said Kathryn Stack, who spent 27 years at the White House Office of Management and Budget and helped design grant programs that award money based on evidence of effectiveness. “There is a private-sector motive to market and falsely advertise benefits of technology, and it’s really critical that we have better information to make decisions on what our technology investments are.”

In 2006, Jefferson County Public Schools, a large Kentucky district that includes the city of Louisville, began using SuccessMaker. The Pearson product is designed to supplement reading and math instruction in kindergarten through eighth grade. Between 2009 and 2014, records provided by the district show it spent about $4.7 million on new licenses and maintenance for SuccessMaker. (It was unable to provide records about its earlier purchases.)

Typically within the district, school principals get to pick the curriculum materials used in their buildings, but sometimes purchases happen at the district level if administrators find a promising product for the entire system.

SuccessMaker, which at the time boasted on its webpage that it was “proven to work” and designed on “strong bases of both underlying and effectiveness research,” never lived up to that promise. In 2014, the district’s program evaluation department published a study on the reading program’s impact on student learning, as measured by standardized tests. The results were stark.

“When examining the data, there is a clear indication that SuccessMaker Reading is not improving student growth scores for students,” the evaluation said. “In fact, in most cases, there is a statistically significant negative impact when SuccessMaker Reading students are compared to the control group.”

The district stopped buying new licenses for the education software — but only after it had spent millions on a product that didn’t help student learning.

Students are ghosting teachers:Without in-person classes, many students have essentially gone missing, teachers say

Companies can grade their own software

That same school year, Pearson paid for a study of SuccessMaker Reading in kindergarten and first grade. The company said the study found positive effects that were statistically significant, a claim it continues to make on its website, along with this summary of the program: “SuccessMaker has over 50 years of measurable, statistically significant results. No other digital intervention program compares.”

An independent evaluator disagrees.

Robert Slavin, a Johns Hopkins professor, wanted to watchdog companies who are selling schools software to be purchased with federal money. The 2015 federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act, sets guidelines for three levels of evidence that qualify as purchases: strong, moderate and promising. But companies get to decide for themselves which label best describes their studies. A year after the law passed, Slavin started Evidence for ESSA.

“Obviously, companies are very eager to have their products be recognized as meeting ‘ESSA Strong,’” Slavin said, adding that his group is trying to fill a role he hopes the government will ultimately take on. “We’re doing this because if we weren’t, nobody would be doing it.”

Slavin’s organization tries to fill the gap by offering schools an independent assessment of the research that companies offer up for their products.

When Slavin’s team reviewed SuccessMaker research, they found that well-designed studies of the education software found no significant positive outcomes.

Slavin said Pearson contested the Evidence for ESSA determination, but a follow-up review by his team returned the same result. “We’ve been back and forth and back and forth with this, but there really was no question,” Slavin said.

Pearson stands behind its findings. “Our conclusion that these intervention programs meet the strong evidence criteria … is based on gold-standard research studies — conducted by an independent third-party evaluator — that found both SuccessMaker Reading and Math produced statistically significant and positive effects on student outcomes,” the company said in a statement.

Yet SuccessMaker also hasn’t fared well when judged by another evaluator, the federally funded and operated What Works Clearinghouse.

Launched in 2002, the What Works Clearinghouse assesses the quality of research about education products and programs. It first did a review of SuccessMaker Reading in 2009 and updated it in 2015. The ultimate conclusion: The only Pearson study of the program that met What Works’ threshold for research design showed the program has “no discernible effects” on fifth and seventh graders’ reading comprehension or fluency. (The Pearson study included positive findings for third graders that What Works did not evaluate.)

The Hechinger review of dozens of companies identified seven instances of companies giving themselves a better ESSA rating than Slavin’s site and four examples of companies claiming to have research-based evidence of their effectiveness when What Works said they did not. Two other companies tied their products to What Works’ high standards without noting that the organization had not endorsed their research.

Online school is hard enough:Now imagine you're still learning to speak English

'There isn't a ton of great evidence'

Despite almost 20 years of government attempts to focus on education research, “we’re still in a place where there isn’t a ton of great evidence about what works in education technology,"" said Stack, the former Office of Management and Budget employee. ""There’s more evidence of what doesn’t work.”

In fact, out of 10,654 studies included in the What Works Clearinghouse in mid-April, only 188 — less than 2% — concluded that a product had strong or moderate evidence of effectiveness.

Part of the problem is that good ed tech research is difficult to do and takes a lot of time in a quickly moving landscape. Companies need to convince districts to participate. Then they have to provide them with enough support to make sure a product is used correctly, but not so much that they unduly influence the final results. They must also find (and often pay) good researchers to conduct a study.

When results make a company’s product look good, there’s little incentive to question them, said Ryan Baker, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania. “A lot of these companies, it’s a matter of life or death if they get some evidence up on their page,” he said. “No one is trying to be deceitful. (They’re) all kind of out of their depth and all trying to do it cheaply and quickly.”

Many educators have begun to consider it their responsibility to dig deeper than the research claims companies make. In Kentucky's Jefferson County, for instance, administrators have changed their approach to picking education software, in part because of pressure from state and federal agencies.

Felicia Cumings Smith, the assistant superintendent for academic services in Jefferson, joined the district two years ago, after working in the state department of education and at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. (The Gates Foundation is one of the many funders of The Hechinger Report and is a partial funder of USA TODAY's education team.) Throughout her career, she has pushed school and district officials to be smart consumers in the market for education software and technologies. At Jefferson, she said things have changed since the district stopped using SuccessMaker. The current practice is to find products that have a proven track record of success with similar student populations.

“People were just selecting programs that didn’t match the children that were sitting in front of them or have any evidence that it would work for the children sitting in front of them,” Cumings Smith said.

Jefferson County, one of the 35 largest districts in the country, is fortunate to have an internal evaluation department to monitor the effectiveness of products it adopts. Many districts can’t afford that. And even in Jefferson, the programs that individual principals choose to bring into their schools get little follow-up evaluation.

A handful of organizations have begun to help schools conduct their own research. Project Evident, Results for America and the Proving Ground all support efforts by schools and districts to study the impact of a given product on their own students’ performance. The ASSISTments E-TRIALS project lets teachers perform independent studies in their classrooms. This practice helps educators better understand if products that seem to work elsewhere are working in their own schools. But these efforts reach relatively few schools nationwide.

Some people say educators shouldn’t shoulder the full responsibility of figuring out what works. Vendors, they say, should be held to higher standards of truthfulness in the claims they make about their products.

The Food and Drug Administration, after all, sets limits to what drug and supplement manufacturers can say about their products. So far, ed tech companies have no such watchdog.

Sudden school closures have only complicated the problem, as educators rushed to find online options for students at home. “This is such a crisis that people are, quite understandably, throwing into the gap whatever they have available and feel comfortable using,” Slavin said.

Online testing has problems, too:Online AP exam issues prompt College Board to offer email option. It's too late for thousands of students who will have to test again.

Still, Slavin sees an opportunity in the chaos. Educators can use the next several months to examine ed tech research and be ready to use proven strategies — whether they’re education software or not — when schools do reopen, ultimately making them savvier consumers.

“Students will catch up, and schools will have a taste of what proven programs can do for them,” he said. “At least, that is my hope.”",100,High,Center,USA,1

The retailer, based in Fort Worth, Texas, announced in a news release Tuesday that it was seeking bankruptcy court approval to begin an “orderly wind-down” when stores are able to reopen ""following the government-mandated closures during the COVID-19 pandemic.”

In January, Pier 1 said it planned to close up to 450 stores, or nearly half of its locations. It then filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February.

Robert Riesbeck, Pier 1’s CEO and chief financial officer, said the company had been working to find a buyer to continue operating before the coronavirus.

""Unfortunately, the challenging retail environment has been significantly compounded by the profound impact of COVID-19, hindering our ability to secure such a buyer and requiring us to wind down,” Riesbeck said.

Pier 1 is currently accepting orders on its website and said it will ""initiate store closing efforts and liquidation sales once store locations can reopen, in compliance with COVID-19 guidelines from local government and health officials.""

The company says it has approximately 541 U.S. stores and in the court filing says it plans to reopen some stores on or around May 22.

More retailers are expected to file for bankruptcy and more stores are expected to close because of the impact of COVID-19. J.C. Penney, which filed for bankruptcy Friday, said it plans to close 242 locations.

Pier 1 returns: What you need to know

The company said in its court filing that if its order is approved it will accept returns for the first 30 days from the date it is approved “so long as the return is otherwise in compliance with the Debtors’ return policies in effect as of the date such item was purchased.”

Returns of items sold in the liquidation sale of the company’s initial closing stores will not be accepted.

Pier 1 gift cards, loyalty certificates

Pier 1 has proposed that valid gift certificates, gift cards, and loyalty certificates issued previously will be accepted for 21 days from when the order is approved on its website. Then the gift cards and certificates would be accepted for the first 21 days “from the date of the reopening of any store” for in-person purchases only.

After the 21 days, they will not be accepted and “deemed to have no remaining value,” according to the court filing.

Nevertheless, with stay-at-home orders lifting across the nation and businesses reopening, many employees will be returning to the workplace soon.

States including Alaska, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia have at least partly lifted shutdown orders in recent days. On Wednesday, Wisconsin's Supreme Court struck down Gov. Tony Evers' stay-at-home order and bars and restaurants in the state have already started welcoming back crowds.

While no one wants to be furloughed or unemployed indefinitely, recent surveys show that Americans have mixed feelings about returning to work right now. A Bankrate survey notes that 55% of Americans believe businesses are reopening too soon and 43% say they will shop less in public than before the COVID-19 outbreak.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines to help businesses as they reopen. The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), a workplace safety nonprofit, has provided some guidelines for retail, restaurants, salons, gyms and other service providers and their employees at its Back to Work Safely site. And USA TODAY's reporters and columnists have answers to some common questions people have as businesses reopen:

Must employers ensure the workplace is safe? And will they be held liable if employees contract the virus?

While health care providers must follow federal safety guidelines to guard against contagion, other businesses are not obligated to do so, leaving it to states and localities to set standards, experts say.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires employers to establish a workplace that’s “free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm” to employees. To meet that standard, OSHA is advising businesses to follow CDC guidelines, including instructing employees to keep six feet away from co-workers or customers, taking temperatures, disinfecting surfaces, and providing face masks, hand sanitizers and barriers when appropriate.

In most states, employees who can file a claim through workers’ compensation must take that route and relinquish the right to sue. Meanwhile, winning such a claim can be difficult, with workers having to prove they contracted coronavirus on the job – a high bar during a pandemic. A better case could be made if several employees at a workplace contracted the virus.

“Even though it's recognized that some groups of workers are at elevated risk of catching a virus, there's still that reality that they may be catching it outside of work,” says John Ruser, CEO of the Workers Compensation Research Institute, an independent group that analyzes workers compensation issues. “The burden of proof would be pretty heavy for them to show that it was work-related.”

If your co-worker gets COVID-19 and you fear you'll be infected, can you quit and collect unemployment?

Generally, you can only qualify for unemployment if you lost your job due to COVID-19, you’ve left your job to take care of family member who has been infected, or you’re quarantining on the advice of a health care provider and you’re unable to perform your duties.

In fact, guidance in regards to the CARES act specifically states that quitting a job without cause to get benefits would be deemed fraud. You would have to prove you were possibly exposed to the virus.

If you believe your employer’s response to the possible spread of COVID-19 creates “a serious safety hazard” or if you think your employer is not following federal work safety standards, you can file a complaint with OSHA.

My boss is hiring people to replace those of us who were laid off, and reducing existing employees' hours by half. Is that legal for a business that received PPP funds?

The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) does not require businesses to rehire the same people that were laid off. It only requires that the loan will be forgiven if at least 75% of the total amount is spent on personnel with the remainder on work-related costs, such as rent, mortgage, or utilities. If you believe your boss has acted improperly or illegally, you could contact your local or state labor agency to file a complaint.

I am concerned my job puts me at high risk for COVID-19. Can I ask my employer to furlough me?

You can’t refuse to come to work based on anxiety over exposure alone. Keep in mind that 31% percent of employers have laid-off workers and 15% have permanently cut the headcount with no intention to rehire, so asking for a furlough could be risky unless your company is already taking that measure. Your employer is not obliged to grant your request – and it could offend or upset your boss so carefully consider whether you want to make that move.

I have Type 1 diabetes, so I'm at risk for the coronavirus. People in the office are sick but are not staying home. Can I ask to work from home?

Type I diabetes can be considered a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Working from home may be a reasonable accommodation your employer could be required to consider. In addition, you are at high risk during this pandemic according to the CDC.

Talk to your supervisor about it: Outline how working from home won’t impact productivity. Describe what your setup will be and how it allows you to work well without being in the workplace – and take notes.

There's never been a virus like it.

""This gets into every major biological process in our cells,"" said Nevan J. Krogan, a molecular biologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who has studied HIV, Ebola, Zika, dengue and other viruses over the past 13 years.

""At the molecular level, it's something we've never seen before, and then look at what it does to the body – the long list of symptoms – we've never seen that before.""

As Americans debate the reopening of businesses, bars, schools and other aspects of everyday life, it's important to understand the virus we are up against and why it has sown so much suffering and confusion.

At first, the virus was thought to be mostly a risk to older adults and people with chronic illnesses; its primary point of attack, the lungs. Then 30- and 40-years-olds with the virus began dying of strokes. Recently, a small number of infected children have died of a mysterious illness resembling Kawasaki disease.

'Like a war':Pfizer head of vaccines talks finding a treatment for coronavirus

Symptoms of COVID-19 range from fever, coughing and shortness of breath to the loss of smell and taste and the angry red swelling that has come to be known as ""COVID toes."" Studies have found that damage from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19, isn't limited to the lungs; it can include the heart, liver, kidneys, gastrointestinal system and bowels.

To understand a virus' ""motivation"" – why it does what it does – keep in mind that it is a parasite. It lives inside its human or animal host taking what it needs at the expense of the host.

As long as it finds hosts without immunity, and as long as its own mutations do not weaken its ability to spread and multiply, the virus thrives.

Key benchmarks of a virus are how widely it spreads and how deadly it is to those it infects.

In the five months since it was first identified in Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 4.5 million people across the globe, killing more than 300,000.

""The thing that strikes me about the clinical aspect is the shear amount of transmissibility,"" said Megan Freeman, a virologist and specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.

""There are very few viruses that are more contagious than this one,"" agreed Mark Schleiss, an investigator for the Institute of Molecular Virology at the University of Minnesota.

A single COVID-19 patient spreads the disease to a median of 5.7 people, making it twice as contagious as the 1918 Spanish flu, according to a report in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.

The rate of infection in the U.S. – what experts are referring to when they talk about ""flattening the curve"" – has slowed. Even so, the nation is still averaging about 1,000 COVID-19 deaths a day, roughly twice the number of deaths from 9/11 every week.

Thousands of the world's best scientists have worked with remarkable speed seeking to understand the new coronavirus. They deciphered its genetic code in barely a week and have produced scores of papers suggesting possible treatments and vaccines.

""The canvas we call COVID-19 was blank 16 weeks ago,"" said Gregory Poland, director of Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group. ""We've filled in a lot of dots, but we have so much more to go.""

""We don't understand HIV that well in my opinion,"" Krogan said, ""and we've been studying that for decades.""

Seeking the Achilles' heel of the virus

Scientists know some but not all of the reasons the new coronavirus spreads so easily. Freeman points to several factors, including one that distinguishes SARS-CoV-2 from the virus it closely resembles, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

SARS attacks the lower respiratory system, whose job it is to pull in air from the upper respiratory system.

SARS-CoV-2, however, attacks the upper respiratory system, the pathway that allows air to travel in and out of the lungs as we breathe. The upper airway is also the system involved when we cough.

The upper respiratory system offers a more efficient means of spreading, Freeman said.

""That's why it is more transmissible. ... When this emerged probably there was some mutation that adapted it to use the upper airway, and the upper airway has made it very successful.""

A second difference between SARS and SARS-CoV-2 involves the bond that allows viral cells to attach to human cells and infect them. With both viruses, this bond forms between the Spike Protein on the virus and a region on the outside of the human cell called the ACE-2 receptor.

Both viruses use this bond to enter cells, but the bond is much stronger with the new coronavirus than it was with SARS. That is why many of the potential treatments so far are designed to undermine that bond.

""You always want to target the Achilles' heel of the virus, something the virus does not have the luxury of changing too much"" explained Maria Elena Bottazzi, a professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine and co-developer of a potential SARS vaccine that is going to be tested on SARS-CoV-2.

Although public health leaders compared the new coronavirus to seasonal flu early on, coronaviruses have a special feature that separates them from other viruses like flu. They have their own proofreading system that helps limit mistakes in their genetic code known as mutations.

""Flu viruses make six and a half times more mistakes than coronaviruses do,"" Freeman said.

Even as the spread of the virus slows in the United States, some researchers fear what will happen if major outbreaks hit poorer, densely populated cities in Africa.

""Look at the problems we've had,"" Poland warned. ""Now amplify that through areas that have civil wars, that have corruption, that have scarce resources. That's a humanitarian disaster in the making.""

A remarkable destroyer

The virus' skill at spreading poses one challenge; what it does inside the human body poses another.

Much of what scientists have learned so far about the new coronavirus suggests that it is a remarkable destroyer at both the micro and macro levels, decimating individual cells and entire organs.

At the molecular level, the virus disrupts some of the most fundamental functions of life: cell division; the system cells use to talk with one another; and their ability to make proteins.

The proteins our bodies make help us carry out almost every human action from eating and walking to breathing and thinking.

Once a person ingests the new coronavirus, it enters the lungs and directly infects the air sacs, the microscopic workhorses that take in the air we breathe. In serious cases, the air sacs fill with fluid, leaving less and less room for oxygen. This is a feature of what is known as COVID-19 pneumonia.

The pneumonia can lead to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, a severe breathing condition that deprives the vital organs of oxygen.

A healthy blood oxygen level is usually between 95% and 100%. Below 90% is low. Some COVID-19 patients have been found to have blood oxygen levels below 65%.

As the air sacs are infected and damaged, this triggers the immune system, which can lead to a dangerous condition called a cytokine storm. In a cytokine storm, the immune system goes into overdrive and winds up killing both healthy and diseased cells.

One of the most subtle and deadly offshoots of low blood oxygen is a condition called silent hypoxia.

As described by emergency room doctor Richard Levitan in a commentary in The New York Times, silent hypoxia allows patients to develop low blood oxygen levels without realizing the problem until it dips into dangerous territory. They breathe faster to compensate for the lack of oxygen but are unaware they are breathing faster.

Levitan suggested that people can bypass long waits for coronavirus tests, using a simple device called a pulse oximeter as an early warning system for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia. The device, which fits over your finger, measures blood oxygen levels, and can be bought at pharmacies without prescription for about $30.

Unfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 does not restrict its damage to the lungs.

The virus also causes blood clots, which have led to people in their 30s and 40s dying from strokes.

And then there are the recent cases in New York and Paris of children with COVID-19 who develop symptoms closely resembling Kawasaki disease. The disease begins with a rash and fever, inflames blood vessels, and eventually can damage the coronary arteries that deliver blood to the heart.

""What is it about COVID-19 that it produces Kawasaki disease?"" said Schleiss, at the University of Minnesota, who estimates he has seen more than 1,000 Kawasaki cases in his medical career.

""I don't think SARS-CoV-2 is a cause of Kawasaki disease, but it is the cause of something very similar.""

Every few weeks, SARS-CoV-2 seems to reveal new and disturbing oddities.

A recent study from China published in the journal JAMA Network Open, reported finding the new coronavirus in the semen of six of 38 infected men, raising concern that it may be possible to transmit the virus through sexual contact.

The virus also has been found in patient stool samples and untreated wastewater. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that standard methods at wastewater treatment plants should be effective enough to protect workers.

Such discoveries, however, raise fundamental questions, as we try to return to our old lives. Have we yet determined all of the ways the virus can spread from one person to another? Are there activities that may pose risks we have not anticipated?

At the University of California, San Francisco, Krogan said it will be important to examine the genetic scripts of both those who suffer severe cases of COVID-19 and those who get mild or no disease at all.

Hydroxychloroquine is FDA-approved to treat autoimmune conditions such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. It can also be used to treat some forms of drug-resistant malaria or to protect against certain types of malaria.

The President appears to be taking it as a prophylactic, with the thought it could prevent someone exposed to coronavirus from getting it. There is at least one study looking into this usage underway but no data to support the idea yet.

Hydroxychloroquine can be administered either as a pill or by intravenous drip and is marketed under the brand name Plaquenil.

Because it is FDA-approved for those diseases, physicians are legally free to prescribe it in any manner they want ""off-label,"" meaning not for the reason listed on the drug's label.

It is not available over the counter at drug stores. It is also different from chloroquine, an anti-malaria drug that Trump has at times suggested as a treatment or preventative for COVID-19.

There is no data to support the notion that hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine helps people infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

There is strong evidence that hydroxychloroquine can cause abnormal heart rhythms and a dangerously rapid heart rate, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

“There’s no proof that it works and some people might experience side effects that could be severe. There’s no proof that it works and some people might experience side effects that could be severe,” said Dr. Daniel Kaul, a professor of infectious disease at the University of Michigan school of medicine. “

The FDA has cautioned that hydroxychloroquine should be limited to people in clinical trials, which are carefully overseen, or who are hospitalized, due to concerns about the potentially dangerous adverse effects.

Trump says he's taking hydroxychloroquine, the drug he touted as coronavirus treatment, despite FDA warnings

A study posted on April 21 involving 368 patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 treated at Veterans Health Administration medical centers found there were more deaths among those given hydroxychloroquine than those receiving standard care. In addition, the drug made no difference in the need for ventilators.

The U.S. National Institutes of Health launched a large clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine given in conjunction with the antibiotic azithromycin last week. It is among multiple studies underway to see if the drug can help decrease hospitalization and death from coronavirus.

In a statement on the N.I.H. website about the study, Dr. Anthony Fauci noted that while where was anecdotal evidence that the drugs might benefit some people, ""we need solid data from a large randomized, controlled clinical trial to determine whether this experimental treatment is safe and can improve clinical outcomes.”

'This will kill you': People are warning others following Trump's apparent use of hydroxychloroquine

The University of Minnesota is also in the midst of a large study of whether the drug can be used prophylactically, but it will not be completed until August.

""There is no data that pre-exposure prophylaxis is effective in prevention COVID-19. The study we're conducting should help us answer the question,"" said Mahmoud Al-Kofahi, a professor of experimental and clinical pharmacology at the University of Minnesota.

Another worry is that people taking it might have a false sense that they’re protected from becoming infected COVID-19 or cannot become infected and therefore cannot pass it along.

“The concern would be they might change their behavior and put others at risk,” said Michigan's Kaul.

Hydroxychloroquine craze has French roots

The drug first came to public attention after several small, anecdotal, non-peer reviewed reports about the drugs in China in February. None were up to the scientific gold standard of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that would definitively show they worked or not.

Interest in hydroxychloroquine took off when a controversial microbiologist in France posted a video on Feb. 25 promoting the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19. Didier Raoult, has denied climate change is happening and wrote a book declaring Darwin's theory of evolution was wrong.

Raoult then posted two small studies of the drugs on COVID-19 patients that were quickly criticized by scientists because they had no control group, making it impossible to know if people who got the drugs recovered any faster than those who didn't.

Television doctor Mehmet Oz initially supported the drug multiple times on Fox and Friends but later backed away from it.

Trump first spoke about hydroxychloroquine given together with the antibiotic azithromycin on March 19. He went on to tout them numerous times in various media and public events.

On April 13 he announced his administration had deployed roughly 28 million doses of hydroxychloroquine from the National Stockpile. ""Just recently, a friend of mine told me he got better because of the use of that, that drug,"" he said in a briefing.

Since late April Trump had toned down his support of the drug, but during a roundtable discussion with restaurant executives at the White House on Monday said he began about a week and a half ago.

That was around the time two people in the White House who would have been in close contact with him tested positive for COVID-19. One was a valet to the president, the other Vice President Mike Pence's press secretary, Katie Miller.",100,High,Center,USA,1

Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said that if a ""big peak"" of coronavirus floods hospitals this winter, ""we have the potential here to go through days we have not seen since World War II. ... As a nation, we will not be ready.""

“What we’re experiencing is a massive global destabilization of all our systems,” adds Brian David Johnson, a futurist and director of the Threatcasting Lab at Arizona State University. “We actually don’t know all the damage that has happened. We’re on life support, globally.”

If the world premiere of COVID-19 caught you off guard, you may need to get prepared for a sequel.

Many scientists believe the pandemic likely will dissipate over the summer only to return late this year in a second wave that could be worse than the first. While that outlook is no certainty – just one of several plotted by public health experts – disaster planning is all about anticipating worst-case scenarios.

So, with months to go before a possible Round 2, is the United States prepared – medically, economically and emotionally?

The leading answer from epidemiologists, economists and futurists: probably not. But tomorrow depends in part on what we do as individuals, communities and a nation.

The destabilization described by Johnson is glaringly evident in three realms:

Medicine. Some U.S. hospitals, hit with patient surges in COVID-19 hot spots, warned of running out of ventilators, personal protective equipment and other supplies. The Strategic National Stockpile was nearly emptied. Thanks to a global manufacturing binge, supplies appear to be catching up and, in key locations such as New York City, the disease is abating for now. But, if the coronavirus returns with a second wave, will the health care system be ready?

The economy. Unemployment is higher than any time since the 1930s. Businesses – from mom-and-pop shops to major corporations – are going under. Global trade is crippled. Travel, sports and entertainment industries are mostly dormant. How much more financial trauma can the economy endure?

Emotional damage. Psychological, social and political strains of the coronavirus, though not easily measured, are palpable products of a medical and economic nightmare. If the pandemic gets worse down the road, threatening our fabric of work, schools, homes and governance, will Americans be ready?

Preparedness is not easily defined. In biblical lore, Egypt endured 10 plagues – water turning to blood, swarms of locusts, even an infestation of frogs – and it’s still around.

But, if COVID-19 has delivered any lesson, it may be the value of looking ahead at a nation's ability to absorb catastrophic shock.

Hoping for a miracle

On the health care front, it’s crucial to recognize that COVID-19 is, as University of Michigan epidemiologist Arnold Monto puts it, “a very strange virus.”

Its origin, transmission, symptoms and damage remain puzzles. And its future seems to defy computer modeling. Because of that, experts start any conversation by warning that the first wave is still cresting and that predicting the future of the coronavirus is a fool’s game.

“If you don’t express doubt about what’s going to happen, you really haven’t done your job,” noted Monto, who has consulted for the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control. “My take is you have to keep an open mind and prepare for all eventualities.”

Monto and others point out that COVID-19’s threat could be blunted by the development of a vaccine or a treatment.

But many epidemiologists share the view of Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, who testified during a congressional hearing Tuesday: “The idea of having treatments available or a vaccine to facilitate reentry of students into the fall term would be something that would be a bit of a bridge too far.”

In the absence of a panacea, public health experts say, comprehensive testing is the immediate solution. It would allow disease tracking and quarantines to significantly dull a second COVID-19 spike. Most argue that testing and tracing is the most important step in controlling the disease. But they also contend those efforts have been a bust in the United States so far.

“We still haven’t gotten our act together,” said Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. “I think it’s inevitable that we’re going to have a second, if not a third, wave” because of the nation’s “erratic and disorganized policies.”

“The biggest single failure was the lack of testing in this country,” agreed Eric Toner, senior scholar with Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security. “That influenced every single other thing that has gone wrong. … And we still have problems in testing.”

Until the disease can be monitored and controlled, Toner warned, “we need to be really careful about dialing back social distancing. It has been amazingly successful – more effective than I thought it would be.”

Monto's big fear is a resurgence of COVID-19 coinciding with a deadly flu outbreak, overwhelming hospitals, health care workers and supply systems. “If they’re all synchronized, it may really break down,” he said. “To me, that’s the worst-case scenario.

I don’t think we’re ready now.""

Medical supplies: The great unknown

Without a vaccine or treatment, and with testing problematic, hospital preparedness looms crucial.

But questions about medical supplies lead to a dead end. It's not clear how many ventilators or personal protection outfits would be needed, how many are now in stock, or how many may be produced by a ramped-up manufacturing system during the coming months.

In mid-April, Toner estimated supply demands in the United States for a 100-day surge of COVID-19: 4 billion gloves, 321 million gowns and 179 million medical-grade masks. But those numbers are no longer valid, he said, and the actual need is unclear.

Even if an accurate count was available, there is no national inventory showing the volume of supplies on hand.

Nor is there a calculation of worldwide manufacturing increases amid the crisis, which could meet the demand.

In a National Action Plan for medical preparedness issued this month, Toner and other researchers at Johns Hopkins portray the U.S. health care system almost like an intensive care patient who is bleeding out – desperately needing an infusion of money to restock supplies and reinforce staffing.

While a federal bailout bill provides $175 billion to cover losses, the report says, that's not nearly enough.

While the price is high, authors concluded, “it will certainly cost less than the trillions now being spent spend because our public health and health care system was not prepared or equipped for this pandemic.”

Economy: Recovery or ruin?

In a recent op-ed for The New York Times, Romer and fellow economist Alan Garber wrote about the dueling threat coronavirus poses to America's public health and financial well-being. While shutdowns may allow some people to survive, they concluded, “it is our economy that will be dead.”

In an interview, Romer said that whether COVID-19 stays on its present course or ebbs and surges, the nation faces an unemployment rate of 30%, yet people seem to think it will just go away allowing life to resume as before.

""There's this optimistic bias, and a certain amount of denial,"" he said. ""With no change in policy, they're just not going back to those jobs … and there's a good chance those jobs won't be there.""

Unless or until a vaccine is developed, Romer said, the only hope is a biweekly testing requirement for everyone, with those who have the disease going into isolation.

An alternative would be to choose the economy over safety. But Romer said that raises a tragic question: ""Are we willing to accept 2,000 deaths a day for months on end?""

“The longer it goes on, the more it’s going to imply we’re just not coming back to the same place,” agreed Ken Rogoff, economics professor at Harvard and former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund.

While declining to give the nation a letter grade for preparedness, Rogoff said COVID-19 has undermined much of the planet's economic structure. As one example, he said, “we’re going to see just a collapse of global trade. We may have a world where (nations) … become more like fortresses.”

Rogoff praised the “drastic measures” taken thus far in the United States to fight the pandemic, including huge relief allocations. But such tactics cannot be sustained, he said, and leaders in Washington, D.C., seem unequipped for prolonged viral waves. “The problem is, where is the economy heading?” Rogoff said. “Are they mentally prepared for that? I doubt it. … It’s not going to be easy, because the political system is really fragile.”

Colin F. Camerer, a professor of behavioral finance and economics at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, said COVID-19 may require intense, short-term pain to achieve a long-term gain. He and others pointed to South Korea as a model nation that used comprehensive testing and strict social distancing to weather the economic storm while limiting infections. By contrast, Italy and the United States – which were slow to test or take precautions – have suffered heavy casualties and economic damage.

“The No. 1 thing is to get the first wave over, and then prepare for the second one,” Camerer said.

Surviving a psychic trauma

Almost everything about American life has changed: jobs, schools, homes, churches, entertainment.

Psychiatric journals are churning out articles on suicide and mental health problems triggered by fear, financial ruin and social isolation. An already polarized political system seems utterly askew, with dueling versions of reality. And the internet's output of conspiracy theories, lies and apocalyptic visions has gone on steroids.

Johnson, the futurist at Arizona State University, said it’s not yet clear how we’re handling the first go-round of coronavirus, let alone additional waves. But upheaval is coming.

After the 9/11 attacks, Johnson noted, there were changes – from sweeping anti-terror legislation to relatively small things, like footwear: ""We’ve normalized taking off our shoes at the airport.”

While Johnson prefers to focus on human resiliency, he acknowledged doomsday visions are part of the profession. With COVID-19, he said, ""there are ways of looking at this destabilization where it does not restablize.""

Thomas Frey, a futurist and founder of the DaVinci Institute in Colorado, said the pandemic may be “the most explosive crisis in all of world history” – a potential paradigm shift not just economically but culturally.

Fundamental gestures, such as the handshake, are likely to vanish or change.

Yet Frey also questioned whether worldwide “hysteria” over the disease is rational, and he suggested that shutting down a country may be overreactive unless the death toll borders on 1 million.

“It’s a bizarre balancing act we’re trying to maneuver,” he said. “I think our emotional preparedness – societal preparedness – I’d give that a failing grade. I actually don’t see us having the political will do go through this again.”

Nancy Berlinger, a research scholar with The Hastings Center, a non-partisan bioethics institute in New York, said it’s clear America is not ready for a second viral peak “because we were not prepared for the first.”

Berlinger, who lives in one of the world's hardest-hit communities, speaks with evangelical passion about displaying virtues during catastrophe times: Compassion. Open-mindedness. Unselfishness.

While the pandemic has created wrenching dilemmas for leaders, she said, daily personal decisions such as social distancing also fall within the ethical prism, and selfishness may empower a pandemic to take more lives, cause more suffering.

“It’s about the moral choices each and every one of us make,” Berlinger said. “I hope we will in every way possible have a stronger sense of who our neighbor is, who our fellow citizen is.”

It's important to understand that the numbers reported by agencies and officials don't paint a complete picture of the pandemic. Many people who have COVID-19 — and no one knows how many — are not being counted by medical authorities. Because COVID-19 can have mild symptoms or even none at all, many people with the disease are unaware they have it. Others may have symptoms, but be unable to access testing near them.

Some types of masks are not intended for reuse, but there are a few things you can do to sanitize them, upgrade filtration and extend their lives. Here are some strategies that will help you get the most out of your mask, and keep you and your family safe.

Let's say you just got back from the grocery store wearing your mask. Now what?

1. Treat your mask like a biohazard.

Isolate it from the rest of your family. “You don't want to be leaving it on the kitchen counter or the coffee table where other people may inadvertently be handling it,” says Kirsten Koehler, an associate professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

2. Wash your hands with soap every time you remove or even touch the mask.

Act as if the virus is on both sides of the fabric. Make sure to wash your hands properly for at least 20 seconds.

Those are coronavirus mask basics.

There’s much more to know, though, if you want to extend the life of your gear or even make your own mask.

How to clean homemade cloth face masks and the best material to make one

To clean your mask, run it through the washing machine and dryer after use. The water doesn't necessarily needs to be hot but make sure to use a laundry detergent.

If you don't have access to a washing machine, you can hand-wash using soap. Another option: Put the mask into a paper bag and leave it in a warm place for at least two days. After that, the virus will become inactive and won’t be infectious.

When you are wearing a homemade mask, you should keep in mind that you are not wearing the mask to protect yourself, but to minimize the spread of virus particles to others. Even if you feel no effects, you may be asymptomatic.

Homemade masks are less effective at protecting the wearer because most have voids, or spaces near your nose and cheeks where the tiny droplets can be inhaled, and the pores in the fabric alone are generally not small enough to trap tiny aerosolized droplets.

Some materials make better masks than than others. According to a study published in Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness, homemade masks made from a kitchen towel proved to be the most effective at removing particles.

On the other hand, T-shirts or pillowcases may be the best choice as they can provide a better fit by stretching. Avoid using old fabrics because washing and drying may stretch the pores, allowing more particles to get in.

The choice of fabric is very important. Professor Koehler suggests using tightly woven fabric folded in multiple layers. A research paper published in PeerJ confirms the fabric concern. The study looked at the surface of 20 different types of cloth masks and found the size of pores in masks ranged from 80 to 500 micrometers. For comparison, the novel coronavirus is about 0.12 micrometers:

You may also want to avoid thick materials like vacuum cleaner bags. A material with high resistance will force air to escape through routes around the mask fabric creating a void. Also, breathing through a thick mask can be tough on your heart and lungs. This could put elderly people and those with preexisting cardiopulmonary conditions at risk.

""It shouldn't be so difficult that you just can't physically breathe, but you should notice some resistance in your breathing,"" Dr. Koehler said. ""Otherwise your mask is probably not doing anything.""

Adding any sort of filtering inside the mask may help to reinforce it and add additional protection. An engineer specializing in aerodynamics has tested the effectiveness of paper towels. A single layer captured 23% of particles 0.3 microns or larger. Adding an extra layer increased particle capture to 33%.

Phillip Clapp, a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Environmental Medicine, Asthma, and Lung Biology at the University of North Carolina, has been testing various homemade masks. When he studied three layers of cotton fabric, he saw that the material itself had efficiency of around 90%. However, once he wore the mask made from that material, its efficiency dropped below 50%.

""And what that tells us is that it really has to do with how well that mask will fit your face, as to how well you'll be protected,"" Dr. Clapp said.

The mask should cover both your nose and mouth. The CDC has published several tutorials on making face masks, which include masks with elastic ear loops as well as tie strings. If you choose to make a mask with tie strings, it's important to make sure the straps fit correctly around the head so the mask does not fall down.

When wearing a mask, secure the bottom ties first with a bow around the nape of your neck. Then, pull the mask by the upper ties over your mouth and chin and secure around your head.

Preliminary results from a study by researchers at Northeastern University show that sewn fabric masks can in some cases approach the filtration efficiency of commercially produced masks.

Adding an elastic outer layer improved fit for all mask types tested. Particularly helpful was adding an outer layer made from nylon stockings. Even surgical masks were found to perform better with stockings during the study.

You should not clean an N95 mask at home. But you can reuse it with proper care. Here's how:

The general public is asked not to purchase N95 respirators due to shortages in the medical supply. But if you have one, they offer good protection. The key with the N95 respirator is proper fit: There should be no air gaps or voids around the nose, cheeks or chin.

According to Koehler, some data suggests that the virus could live on N95 respirators up to seven days, as opposed to about two days for the cloth fabrics.

She recommends using a method that isolates the mask in a breathable location:

Never use cleaning products such as Lysol, alcohol or bleach. Liquid, including soap and water, can damage the mesh of electrically charged fibers designed to catch particles and droplets.

Can you use expired face masks and respirators?

Expired N95 respirators remain as effective as the new ones, Clapp said. He tested respirators that were as far as 11 years behind the expiration date. While the respirator may still filter particles as good as new, elastic bands that may deteriorate.

Can you clean and reuse disposable surgical masks? Sort of. Here's how:

Surgical masks are intended to protect the wearer’s face from large droplets and splashes of blood and other body fluids. Efficiency of surgical mask filters can range from less than 10% to nearly 90% depending on the manufacturer and the type of the mask. According to Clapp, surgical masks with ear loops (38.9% effective) performed worse than surgical masks with tie strings (71.5% effective.)

Generally, surgical masks are less effective than N95 respirators because they don’t provide a seal around the nose and mouth, which could allow smaller droplets to get in. At the same time, studies show that they are better than homemade masks at protecting from larger particles.

Ana Rule, an assistant professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, recommends not buying surgical masks to ensure enough supply for health care workers. Wear one only if you have it already at home.

How to reuse: The best strategy is to isolate it for a week in a breathable container such as a paper bag. Putting masks in the plastic may lead to accumulation of moisture and development of bacteria. Surgical masks should not be washed, because liquid damages the filter.

How to clean and reuse elastomeric respirators

When elastomeric respirators are properly fit tested and worn, they can provide the user with an effective face seal and will hold up to repeated use, cleaning and maintenance. As with N95 masks, use only if you already have one.

How to clean and reuse the respirator: Wipe down with alcohol swabs to disinfection after each use. The attached filter cartridges are replaceable and are easily changed. Though they can be reused, their life span depends on many factors such as exposure and concentration of particles. It's important to double check if the cartridges you have are designated for filtering coronavirus particles.

Using masks in the family

The best practice is just for one person within a family to go to a store or other places where it might be difficult to maintain social distancing. Parents should ensure that children don't touch their face, because wearing the mask may encourage them to do so. CDC recommends that children under 2 years old shouldn't wear the mask because of the risk of suffocation.",100,High,Center,USA,1

Soon after, ""Flintstone Vitamins"" began trending on Twitter.

But, many doctors, journalists and politicians issued stern warnings after the president's revelation.

Trump, who said he has tested negative for COVID-19, said he has been taking hydroxychloroquine daily for about a week and a half as an added measure to avoid getting the coronavirus. He said the White House physician ""didn't recommend"" hydroxychloroquine but offered it to him.

He has repeatedly touted the drug as a treatment for coronavirus, despite little concrete evidence it effectively treats the disease. There is no data to support the notion that hydroxychloroquine helps people infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

More:Can hydroxychloroquine prevent COVID-19? President Trump thinks maybe. There's no data to support that.

Fox News anchor Neil Cavuto warned of taking hydroxychloroquine, saying it could kill people who are in certain health risk populations.

""The fact of the matter is though, when the president said 'what have you got to lose?', in a number of studies, those certain vulnerable population has one thing to lose: their lives,"" Cavuto said.

He continued, ""I cannot stress enough. This will kill you. So, again, whatever benefits the president says this has, and certainly it has had for those suffering from malaria, dealing with lupus, this is a leap that should not be taking casually by those watching from home or assuming well the president of the United States says it's ok.""

A few studies have shown the drug has not been effective against COVID-19, and some point to an increase in heart problems.

The FDA has cautioned that hydroxychloroquine should be limited to people in clinical trials, which are carefully overseen, or who are hospitalized, due to concerns about the potentially dangerous adverse effects. Trump appears to be taking it as a prophylactic, with the thought it could prevent someone exposed to coronavirus from getting it.

""Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing COVID-19,"" the FDA warned. Both can cause abnormal heart rhythms and a dangerously rapid heart rate, the statement said.

Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and former health commissioner for Baltimore, tweeted that ""There is NO evidence for hydrochloroquine being effective in treatment of #covid19 or prophylaxis to prevent the disease.""

""This is a medication that has serious side effects. I am very concerned about @realDonaldTrump continuing to model behavior that could harm many Americans,"" she concluded.

Congressman Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who briefly ran to be the 2020 Democratic nominee, warned followers to not self-medicate with the drug, and posted that, ""The FDA has repeatedly warned against taking hydroxychloroquine. It has potentially deadly side effects.""

Trump's top health advisers – Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx – showed up at a White House event last Friday with protective masks, though the president himself continued to avoid using any facial protection in public.

Choices will have to be made about who goes to the front of the line.

“It’s inevitable that the vaccine will come out more slowly than we like. We’re not going to have 350 million doses delivered day one,” said Andrew Pavia, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.

To be most protective, a list of the first to be immunized must be carefully crafted based on what type of vaccine may become available, who it works best for and whether the disease is still raging.

Since 1964, the United States has relied on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to make those decisions. As soon as the Food and Drug Administration licenses a new vaccine, ACIP offers guidelines on how it should be distributed, to whom and when.

The World Health Organization has a similar group, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization.

More:'Our moon shot': The world needs a coronavirus vaccine ASAP. Despite drugmakers billion-dollar bets, one might not be available for years.

ACIP already has begun working on a plan for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The WHO group began its process last week.

“We’re starting as early as we can to deal with the torrent of data that’s coming out,"" said Dr. Grace Lee, a professor of pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine and a current ACIP member. ""We don’t want to wait until the vaccine becomes available and begin our deliberations then.”

Typically, ACIP’s guidelines would be used without question. That became slightly less clear Friday with the announcement of a White House initiative called Operation Warp Speed.

In a news conference in the Rose Garden, President Donald Trump said the initiative would create a group of experts and bring together the CDC, National Institutes of Health, the FDA and the U.S. military to work at “record speed” to find, test, manufacture and distribute a vaccine.

Moncef Slaoui, a former pharmaceutical executive who Trump named to head Operation Warp Speed, said early clinical trial data from at least one vaccine candidate made him confident “we will be able to deliver a few hundred million doses of vaccine by the end of 2020. We will do the best we can to do that.”

Trump announces 'Operation Warp Speed,' says U.S. could have coronavirus vaccine by January

Vaccine experts have consistently urged caution in presuming a vaccine will be available soon. The White House Coronavirus Task Force's Dr. Anthony Fauci has said that while a vaccine is likely within the next year or two, the process takes time. Securing a vaccine quickly would require everything falling exactly into place, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases has said.

""You can rush vaccine development but only when you understand – there’s no way around it – you are trading safety for speed,"" said Dr. Greg Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group.

Few details of how coordination within Operation Warp Speed would work were provided, and it is unclear what role it will play in vaccine allocation. An unnamed government official involved with the initiative told CNN earlier this month one of the tasks of the group is to determine who gets the first doses.

The CDC referred inquiries about how the two groups would work together to the White House. The White House did not respond to a request for clarification.

Vaccine experts have spent years considering the best and most effective way to dole out immunizations. ACIP has clear and transparent guidelines on how to conduct the process available on its website, and all its meetings in which it votes on vaccine recommendations are public and webcast. The next is on June 24.

Discussions center on balancing protection for the largest number of people with protecting the most vulnerable.

“If I’ve only got 30 million doses for the next year and I’ve got a population of 350 million, who do I assign propriety to?” said Dr. Arthur Reingold, division head of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California at Berkeley and an internationally recognized expert on infectious disease.

Health care providers, first responders, the military, political leaders, older adults, pregnant women and children are generally put at the front of the line, depending on the disease and the vaccine, said Reingold, who served on ACIP for many years.

“All kinds of ethicists are brought to the table,” he said.

Another approach to control an epidemic is to focus on hot spots where a disease is spreading and there are high transmission rates.

""You would rush vaccine to the area, open your clinics and try to get a large proportion of the population vaccinated quickly,"" Pavia said.

For SARS-CoV-2, the devil is in the details because so much remains unknown about who it affects and how.

Vaccines differ. One may be best for healthy adults, another better for children, and a third most effective for older adults or those with preexisting medical conditions.

In the case of the new coronavirus, data might show although older people are severely affected by COVID-19, immunizing their caregivers could better protect them, depending on how effective the vaccine is for different ages.

“We think about who’s at risk for being exposed, who suffers the worst complications and which population provides the highest benefit due to herd immunity,” said Lee.

Herd immunity is when enough people in the population have been infected and developed immunity to the virus that it can no longer spread freely. Scientists' models estimate 65% of the population needs to be immune to establish such immunity and stop the spread of the disease.

So far, infection rates alone are nowhere near high enough to create herd immunity. While a national infection rate in the United States has not yet been determined, in France, an estimated 4.4% of the population is believed to have been infected with the disease as of May 11, according to a paper in the journal Science.

Whoever determines who gets inoculated first, public health experts say past experience shows the best medical conclusion isn’t always the best solution.

During a shortage of flu vaccine in 2004, it was decided that elderly people, who were at high risk, should get vaccinated first. It turned out they didn’t want it.

“They said, ‘I’d rather my grandchildren receive the vaccine,’ ” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the division of infectious disease at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.

After health care workers and first responders are immunized, Schaffner suggested simply making a vaccine available on a first-come, first-served basis.

“Vaccine left in the refrigerator never protected anyone from anything,” he said.

Some health care professionals say Americans need to be part of the conversation about how any coming coronavirus vaccine should be doled out.

“We need to engage with the public now. You’ve got to consider public values,” said Daniel Salmon, a professor of international health who directs the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “It’s not all about what the scientists think.”",100,High,Center,USA,1

You’re not alone. Celebrities are cooped up in their homes across the country just like the rest of us. As we collectively navigate this uncharted territory, USA TODAY presents Quarantine Diaries, which give readers a peek into how our favorite stars are spending their time at home.

Today's diarist is ""Dancing With the Stars"" six-time champion Derek Hough, who romped to ""Chim Chim Cher-ee"" with girlfriend and fellow quarantiner Hayley Erbert on Sunday's ""The Disney Family Singalong 2."" (The couple re-created ""Be Our Guest"" for the first singalong last month.) Here's what life is like for multi-threat entertainer Hough, 34, who appears as a judge on NBC's ""World of Dance"" fourth season (returns May 26). – As told to Bryan Alexander

8 a.m. Sometimes we sleep in, but often we get up about 8 with our cat nuzzling our faces. The bed becomes this animal affair with two cats (Lily and Palo) and dog Romie jumps in at about 7. Most of the time, we don't have breakfast. I drink this green shake in the morning, my favorite thing, with super-green powder and vitamins. I mix it with mango-flavored Pre-Workout. It's healthy and gives a little boost.

Staying Apart, Together: Are you breathing correctly? Plus, the healing power of the Olympics

9:00 a.m. The thing I love doing right now that I've never really had time to do, but I obviously have a lot of time now, is gardening. It's springtime, so everything is blooming. I'm outside for a solid hour in the morning, picking weeds, watering the plants, admiring the new growth. There's something very peaceful and nurturing. It's amazing that gardening is my new favorite thing to do in the morning.

11 a.m. We try work out every day, do something physical. Especially right now. motion equals emotion. Whenever I'm not moving, my brain starts going a little busy. We do something outside or in the garage. I just need to move.

On creating televised routines from home: Choreographing with limited home space has definitely required creativity. But it focuses me. Normally you have a camera operator. But it's just Hayley and me. We have to fix the camera, perform, look at it. And it's like we moved out of frame or the angle's not good. Constant trial and error. Fortunately, we've been part of a lot of shows and tours. So a lot of the costumes didn't make it back to wardrobe, they make it back to our closets. Like those chimney sweep outfits or the Belle costume.

I did see my neighbor outside while I was in full Lumiere costume and I was like, ""Don't even ask me about it."" That was hilarious.

On dancing for stress relief: When I'm dancing professionally or to create something, I'm in that zone. When I'm just dancing for fun, it doesn't look good. I kind of dance like a fool, honestly, like that embarrassing uncle at a wedding. But the truth is, moving around freely with no rules is definitely liberating and makes you feel good.

6 p.m. We start making dinner. I don't know my way around the kitchen at all. I'm a sous chef to Hayley. I call it ""Hayl's Kitchen."" She directs, ""Wash this, watch this, peel this."" We like to watch shows like ""The World's Most Extraordinary Homes"" while we cook. I just love architecture. So there's often times we'll be cooking and I'll fall into a daze watching and she'll be like, ""Babe, we need those things."" And I'm like, ""Sorry, sorry."" But it's fun and nice to create something. I clean up afterward. That way, I feel I've done my part.

Dessert treat: We eat healthy all day. But after dinner is when the candy, popcorn, chips and salsa, and Twizzlers come out. Hayley has made her own ice cream, mint chocolate chip. I was like, ""I didn't know we had that machine."" She made something called S'mores Yumminess. It's graham-cracker crust with marshmallow fluff and chocolate, more graham cracker on top. She bakes it, and it's insane. She's surprising me with these skills.

On working through relationships: After six weeks of being with each other 24/7 is when we started to become like, ""OK, we might've reached our limit here."" But it's been really good, actually. If we don't agree on something or get into an argument, it's very short-lived. Because at this moment of time, we're just thankful for our health and for everything. We don't take that for granted. Also, when you're with somebody, it's not like, ""OK, I'm leaving, I'm going to go cool off out here."" It's like, ""OK, we've got to figure this out as fast as possible."" So it's been good.

What I'm streaming: We knocked out ""Tiger King"" pretty quickly. Fascinating and disturbing. We managed to get through ""Ozark,"" all three seasons. We're loving Netflix's ""Queer Eye,"" which is a great transformational show.

11 p.m. I head to bed at night like 11. This is after we'll watch something on the couch. She's out after like 30 seconds, mouth agape out cold. But I'll watch the movie or the show until about 11.

When quarantine ends: We're going to Yosemite or a national park that is just beautiful. Nature is just the ultimate. Right now with the cats, we're seeing straight up ""National Geographic."" When you watch them all day, you see behavior you've never seen before.

The coronavirus pandemic is causing major disruption across the globe, from the recently announced EU travel ban, suspension of the NBA season and the general shift towards remote work for many American employees. Times are scary, and the deluge of COVID-19 news can be overwhelming at best, and terrifying at worst.

While it's good to stay informed, take practical precautions and look out for yourself and your community during such remarkable events, it's also important to find time for self care, distraction and laughter.

While the TV industry hasn't escaped the pandemic, favorite shows can help soothe and perk us up at least for a half hour at a time. Here are the 10 shows I highly recommend streaming to help alleviate anxiety, spend your self-quarantine time and generally bring a bit more joy into a dark world.

'The Great British Baking Show'

Warm, friendly and with a focus on decent people doing their best (and doing their best to help each other), this British import is one of the happiest TV series ever made. With delectable-looking treats aplenty and kindness abounding, the series (barring the most recent season) is pure joy. And maybe it will inspire you to bake yourself a treat.

Stream it on Netflix.

'Parks and Recreation'

Nothing can stop Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), not even a pandemic. NBC's workplace sitcom is an inspiring stalwart in this genre, full of generally good people trying to do good things. Just skip the two flu-related episodes.

Stream it on Netflix, Hulu or Amazon.

'Making It'

If 'Parks and Rec' isn't enough Poehler and Nick Offerman for you, try their NBC crafting competition reality show. The closest thing the USA has to ""Baking Show,"" the series manages to find sweetness in its crafting, plus a whole lot of overalls for Poehler to wear.

Stream it on Hulu.

'Gilmore Girls'

Although the Gilmore family has plenty of trials and tribulations, the world of quaint small-town Stars Hollow is usually upbeat in this beloved dramedy. The fast-paced jokes and frequent pop culture references help.

Stream it on Netflix.

'High School Musical: The Musical: The Series'

A farcical mockumentary about a high school putting on a production of ""High School Musical,"" the stakes are low in this Disney+ series, though they seem very high (teenagers and their hormones, of course). With a hefty dose of nostalgia, it's a good choice for TV comfort food.

Stream it on Disney+.

'Queer Eye'

If you want to be so moved you come to tears, Netflix's reboot of the makeover reality show is perfect. Inspiration, triumph, overcoming obstacles; all those heartwarming attributes are here when the Fab Five swoop into someone's life to offer as much help as they can give in a week.

Stream it on Netflix.

'Schitt's Creek'

Full of beautiful romance, sunny settings and plenty of humor, Pop TV's sitcom about a rich family that loses it all but gains a little perspective is always a mood booster.

Stream it on Netflix. New episodes on Pop Tuesdays, 9 EDT/PDT.

'The Carol Burnett Show'

Nothing wrong with going classic for your distraction. There are a multitude of series from the mid-20th century available to stream, when TV was a positive affair across the board. I'm partial to the timeless comedy of Burnett, an American treasure.

Stream it on Amazon.

'Fixer Upper'

Chip and Joanna Gaines, their sweet kiddos, many adorable pets and can-do attitude may just give you the confidence you need to get through a tough time. Their home renovations are pretty to look at, too.

Stream it on Hulu.

'Puppy Prep'

A short-form documentary series about service dogs in training, ""Puppy Prep"" is like injecting furry joy right into your veins. With a cheekily funny narrator and a group of very good boys and girls out to do good, there's nothing but uplift here.

Stream it on Hulu.

And if you want a movie... anything on Hallmark

Who cares if it isn't Christmas! Hallmark movies are designed to lift your spirits, and not just during the holiday season. Cheesy romance, adorable small towns, predictably happy endings, we could all use a little of this right now.

As concerts are postponed, sporting events are canceled, schools are closed and tourist hot spots are shut down, experts recommend that even those who show no sign of illness stay home during this time of global pandemic.

That's right: It's advised that you self-quarantine.

Although remaining inside is a good way to protect yourself and others from the coronavirus, and is an important measure to help ""flatten the curve"" of daily cases that put pressure on our health care system, it could lead to a lesser evil: boredom and stir craziness.

What's there to do while stuck indoors? We've compiled 100 suggestions to help make your time quarantined as interesting – and perhaps even as productive – as possible.

The Los Angeles district attorney's office acknowledged Tuesday that convicted sex offender Weinstein will not be extradited anytime soon to face more sex-crime charges in California due to the coronavirus pandemic.

""The virus has delayed the processing of the extradition paperwork,"" said Greg Risling, spokesman for District Attorney Jackie Lacey, in an email to USA TODAY. ""There is no time estimate on when he will appear in a Los Angeles courtroom.""

His statement reiterates what the L.A. district attorney's office has been saying since former Hollywood mogul Weinstein, 68, was convicted of two sex crimes in Manhattan in February and sentenced in March to 23 years in a New York state prison.

More:Read Harvey Weinstein's revealing, rambling statement ahead of sentencing

Although Lacey stated publicly she had begun the extradition process, she was vague about when it could be accomplished as the coronavirus spread throughout the country and especially in crowded jails and prisons.

The unlikelihood of immediate extradition became more obvious after Weinstein tested positive for COVID-19 and was placed in isolation in an upstate New York prison where he is serving his sentence for first-degree sexual assault and third-degree rape.

Weinstein's spokesman, Juda Engelmayer, declined to comment on his medical status, and prison officials can't comment on inmates' medical records. But Weinstein, who has various medical problems and was hospitalized twice immediately after his conviction, is believed to have recovered while incarcerated in a medical unit.

In April, Lacey announced she had charged Weinstein with another sex crime in Los Angeles County, adding to the four charges already pending against him. The new charge is a felony count of sexual battery by restraint stemming from an encounter with a woman at a Beverly Hills hotel in May 2010.

The first four charges, including rape and sexual assault stemming from two encounters in local hotels in February 2013, were announced by Lacey on the opening day in January of Weinstein's Manhattan trial.

""At this time, it is unknown when Weinstein will be transferred to Los Angeles County,"" Lacey said in a statement in April when she announced the new charge. ""Upon his arrival, he will be arraigned on the amended complaint. Once a court date is set, the public will be notified.""",100,High,Center,USA,1

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — The last time bassist Jon Jones played a concert with his country group Eli Young Band was March 8. He hopes to hit the stage again in June to launch a new drive-in concert series in his first return to live music with fans since the devastating coronavirus.

“This is going to be a surreal kind of setting,” Jones said of plans to play acoustically to 400 cars full of people at the new Texas Rangers stadium in Arlington, Texas.

As states start to let businesses reopen under limitations, music industry organizers are testing out new models of smaller, socially distant concerts. Jones is cautiously optimistic that drive-in concerts might help crack open a door for musicians that slammed shut so quickly in March.

“We’re going to be one of those last industries, those last segments that opens up, unfortunately,” Jones said. “I do hope that everybody is cautious and opens up appropriately and slowly.”

George Couri, of artist management company Triple 8 Management, teamed up with the Rangers to put on the four-night concert series called Concert in Your Car starting June 4. The interest was so high that tickets sold out quickly and additional shows were added. In all 3,200 tickets have been sold.

“It’s about creating an experience for live music again,” said Couri. “The big driver for me is to prove it can work. It would give people hope that this can be repeated again and again in many different places.”

But the path ahead for live concerts hasn’t been easy. A venue in Arkansas initially had to postpone an indoor concert that would have defied the state’s ban on large gatherings after health officials ordered the show shut down. The concert featuring singer Travis McCready went on Monday night.

Drive-in concerts aren’t new, but in the wake of the pandemic, the idea hit in Europe and now the United States. Country star Keith Urban played a drive-in theater in Tennessee last week with scaled back production and crew, but he said that he thinks the concert industry in the near future will pivot to a drive-in style, but with larger capacity.

“The stage is going to be coming out to the parking lot and people will be staying in their cars,” said Urban. “It will be an endless tailgate party.”

In Florida, DJ D-Nice, who has been entertaining people online with his popular DJ sets on Instagram called #ClubQuarantine, played music for first-responders in their cars on Saturday. Concert promoter and venue operator Live Nation is planning to test fanless concerts, drive-in concerts and “reduced capacity shows” both indoors and outdoors, according to President and CEO Michael Rapino, who spoke about the ideas on an investor call.

Tailgate Fest in California already proved the car-centered concert was a viable option before the pandemic. The country music festival where fans are encouraged to watch from their RVs, trucks or cars is going into its third year this August.

Melissa Carbone, the CEO of Tailgate Fest, said there are a lot of changes coming to the festival this year because of the coronavirus, including removing a general admission pit area and a VIP pool party, and they are expecting attendance to drop from last year’s high of 25,000. But the lineup of Dierks Bentley, Lynyrd Skynyrd and TLC hasn’t changed as of yet.

“We’re ahead of the curve on it and nobody wants to see live music go away,” said Carbone.

The World Health Organization has guidance and risk assessments for mass gatherings during the COVID-19 outbreak, said Lucia Mullen, an analyst at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and part of the WHO’s expert cell for mass gatherings and COVID-19.

For concerts, Mullen said recommendations included moving events outdoors, limiting attendance, spacing people out, taking temperatures of participants and staff, hand sanitizing stations and extra cleaning. But she said organizers should also look at the aftereffects of holding a mass gathering in an outbreak, such as contract tracing.

“Do they know who is going there so they can follow up with them if they do find out there is a case and alert all of the participants so they can go get themselves checked out?” asked Mullen.

In a rapidly changing outbreak, Mullen said event organizers should rely heavily on the advice of local health officials in their areas.

“Mere weeks can change an epidemiological context in a city,” she said.

For most bands, touring is a large majority of their income, well above what they get for releasing albums. But Couri said this initial launch of drive-in concerts at the Texas stadium won’t be a huge money-making endeavor early on.

They are charging $40 for each car, and all tickets have to be purchased in advance, not on-site. No concessions or merchandise will be available for sale to reduce contact between people. All bands will play acoustically so there’s minimal production crew needed. There won’t even be outdoor speakers because the music will be transmitted by radio.

Jones said for him and the members of Eli Young Band, they aren’t doing the drive-in concerts solely to make up lost income, but instead to give music back to the fans.

“I think people need something safe that they can go do and if we can be that, that’s awesome,” said Jones.",100,High,Center,USA,1

Whether or not we’re willing to admit it, nearly all of us are experiencing a form of trauma because of the coronavirus pandemic. Uncertainty, stress and anxiety are running high.

A recent Common Sense Media and Survey Monkey report found that 61% of teens surveyed reported feeling worried about themselves (or someone in their family) getting sick; 63% reported feeling worried about their family’s ability to make a living; and 42% reported feeling more lonely than usual.

Many parents have lost work and are struggling to provide for their families’ basic needs. Other parents are attempting to work full-time while also caring for their children and overseeing their remote learning. We are grieving the loss of the lives we once knew.

For students, not being able to see friends, participate in regularly scheduled activities or engage in their normal routines is incredibly disruptive. And we, as parents, are learning just how hard it is to get our kids to focus when they’re emotionally distant or distracted — a task even more difficult for educators.

With schools across the country closed, districts acknowledge that student learning capacity is taking a hit. While we’re more forgiving about the number of academic hours logged, school districts can step up in other ways now and when we prepare to return: by supporting students’ social and emotional wellness.

Students need social and emotional support, and this cannot just be the job of therapists and mental health professionals, especially when schools already face a shortage of psychologists and counselors. The current 430-to-1 ratio of students to counselors in the U.S. falls far short of the American School Counselor Association recommendation of 250-to-1.

Teachers, whether they’re working in buildings or remotely, may interact with their students more regularly than anyone else. They need the tools to be able to proactively check in with students’ feelings and practice social emotional skills that will help students cope through the pandemic and beyond.

Beginning classes with a quick check in can go a long way. Asking students to share how they are feeling, a challenge they are facing, or a hope they have for the week can help educators gauge what burdens students are carrying. Every student might not have the words or vocabulary, so using facial expressions or creative modes such as drawing or poetry can bridge the gap. Guiding these conversations can feel tricky and maybe even uncomfortable at first, which is why teachers need a structured framework.

Some people argue that these skills should be practiced in the home, and not in the school. But we’re now in a position where school is in the home. We have a huge opportunity to distribute virtual social and emotional learning tools across the country to support our students, teachers and school communities through this pandemic and beyond.

Stress affects ability to learn

The fact is, our children’s stressors and their inability to properly manage their emotions prevent them from being effective learners. Much like you wouldn’t expect to run a marathon without fueling your body, we cannot expect students to learn without strengthening their minds and their hearts. With studies that show extreme stress can disrupt the architecture of a growing brain, grades don’t matter so much now.

With the emphasis on remote instruction and thinking through what school will look like when we return to “normal,” I urge districts and policy makers to invest in the healing and rebuilding of our whole selves that’s required for us to function at the highest level.

To do this right, we need to teach skills such as emotional identification, expression and management alongside foundational relationship skills and problem-solving strategies. When we provide this foundation for all students, we cultivate a more supportive learning environment and can better understand which students need additional support.

Help students process emotions

COVID-19 will leave a lasting mark. We’re going to need support to heal and grow in its aftermath. While states are re-opening and discussing how to eventually go back to school, most of the focus is on physical safety — masks, temperature checks, extra hand sanitizer, maintaining distancing. But how will your first-grader feel when they can no longer see the smile behind their teacher’s mask, exchange a high five to celebrate a job well done, or receive a hug when they seek a moment of comfort? How will they learn if they’re afraid?

Social emotional learning supports will be essential in helping students process the feelings and emotions that have surfaced as a result of living through a pandemic. Those same supports will help build a foundation for students to express themselves in healthy ways so they can learn and grow for the rest of their lives.

Amid all the economic ruin inflicted by a pandemic, businessman Kevin Smartt said he has tried to do the right thing. ""We have chosen to put people first over economics,"" the CEO of Kwik Chek convenience stores in Texas told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week.

Smartt has kept all 600 employees working even as fuel sales fell 40% and in-stores sales 17%. Workers wear masks and gloves, and they disinfect counters every several minutes. Hand sanitizers are out, and tape marks are on the floor to keep customers apart.

Federal, state and local health guidelines are confusing and even conflicting, Smartt said, yet he has worked hard to comply, and the last thing he needs is to worry about getting sued: ""We should not be punished with unfair lawsuits just because we kept our doors open for the American public.""

Over 100,000 small businesses have closed

He has a point, as businesses across the nation begin to reopen amid the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Economists project that more than 100,000 small companies have already permanently shuttered under the economic tyranny of COVID-19.

It's why the Senate is debating whether to grant liability protection to businesses, and why Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the failure to do so in any new stimulus bill would be a red line GOP senators won't cross. McConnell last week explained that what's needed is ""a legal safe harbor for businesses, nonprofits, governments, workers and schools who are following public health guidelines to the best of their ability.""

AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR JUSTICE:Blanket legal immunity will prolong pandemic

NATIONAL CONSUMERS LEAGUE:Immunizing all companies would hurt both workers, consumers

Fair enough. But the first question is what exactly are those public health guidelines that, if businesses followed, would grant them immunity from lawsuits?

Companies are still waiting. Most states don't have the scientific wherewithal to create best-business practices for a deadly illness that, each day, scientists are learning more about. It calls for the kind of expertise within the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the kind of workplace regulation found at the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

Second wave of COVID-19 coming

But OSHA has punted on this issue, leaving safety options to businesses.

CDC scientists, meanwhile, drafted precisely what's needed — detailed steps on how best to protect students, travelers, employees and worshipers for schools, transit systems, businesses and churches. But the White House has shelved that and has chosen, instead, for the CDC to issue a vague and broad checklist to be followed.

The Trump administration has joined McConnell in calling for business liability protection. But the president can't have it both ways. He can't urge Congress to protect companies from coronavirus claims if they follow public health guidelines, without providing those companies public health guidelines. Neither can trial lawyers benefit from a Catch-22 where businesses get neither clear direction from public health authorities nor protection from lawsuits.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee that called Smartt as a witness, has it right. ""The sooner we can come up with a regulatory, OSHA-driven process to allow big, small and intermediate businesses (guidance), the better off we'll be,"" Graham said last week.

Only a few dozen COVID-19 lawsuits have been filed. But the number could rise, particularly if the virus returns with a vengeance in the fall, as scientists on the White House Coronavirus Task Force are predicting. Temporary liability protection for businesses that are trying to do the right thing as they're being battered by a virus-driven recession would be fair.

But the federal government must first step up to produce a science-based road map for companies on how best to keep customers and employees safe — how best to do the right thing.

Immunity for corporations when they fail to take basic safety precautions against COVID-19 will cause more American workers and consumers to die and further hamper our economic recovery.

Blanket legal immunity will prolong the pandemic, with some businesses inevitably forgoing basic precautions. Workers and consumers will not return to offices, stores and restaurants if companies cannot be held accountable when they fail to prioritize health and safety. If no one is responsible, no one is safe. People will not go back to their normal routines if they don’t feel safe.

A recent poll found that nearly two-thirds of voters across party lines oppose legislation giving guaranteed immunity to businesses, and even small business owners think it’s unnecessary. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce — which has been demanding legal immunity for decades — inadvertently revealed in its own polling that “liability protection” was the lowest priority of small business owners.

As the president of an association representing thousands of trial lawyers, I know that there won’t be a flood of lawsuits, and the Chamber of Commerce knows this, too. Proving that a company acted unreasonably and that those exact actions caused harm will be difficult. It will be extremely challenging to prove that a victim was exposed and got sick in one specific place given the number of places or people from which or from whom that victim could have been exposed.

The cases that move forward will be the ones like those involving nursing homes that kept sick workers on the job resulting in mass death, or food processing plants that offered bonuses to sick employees who came to work.

OUR VIEW:Coronavirus lawsuits immunity requires public health guidelines

National Consumers League:Immunizing all companies would hurt both workers, consumers

Even then, blanket immunity won’t help those sick workers or the families of those who died — it will just shield corporations that failed to take reasonable steps.

Let’s make the health of workers and consumers the top priority and then watch our businesses and economy flourish. We’re all in this together.

We are all adapting to the new normal of navigating COVID-19, with innovative approaches emerging. But not all are good ideas. A case in point is the Republican leadership’s proposals to immunize businesses from accountability if they follow “government guidelines” for operating “safely.” They make it sound reasonable, but when you take a closer look, the proposals would actually jeopardize both workers and consumers and damage our economic recovery.

Many companies are doing their best to address COVID-19 by keeping their workers and customers safe and offering paid leave to employees who show symptoms. But immunizing all companies based on compliance with guidelines is problematic.

First, no authoritative guidelines exist. The Trump administration recently blocked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s detailed reopening guidelines for certain industries because they were overly prescriptive, according to The Associated Press.

The only other federal guidelines, from the CDC and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, offer ""recommendations” rather than actual rules. Similarly, some states have created their own guidelines, but they vary greatly.

We know that certain industries have failed to take reasonable precautions to protect the public and their workforce. What standards will they be held to? Even if such guidelines existed, accountability should never be based solely on compliance with standards. In fact, under current law, compliance with government standards is already a defense from liability; if the standards are sound and a business has complied, companies face no liability. However, all the facts must be considered, including whether the standards are sufficient and applicable to the particular situation.

OUR VIEW:Coronavirus lawsuits immunity requires public health guidelines

American Association for Justice:Blanket legal immunity will prolong pandemic

The Chamber of Commerce, which is supporting immunity, recently wrote that a “one-size-fits-all regulatory approach is simply impossible when talking about adapting safety measures for every workplace in America.”

This is exactly why the flexibility that exists in current rules works — to determine whether a business acted reasonably toward consumers and workers. Congress shouldn’t add another layer of broad immunity based on phantom guidelines and politicians’ whims.

Opinion contributors

As the pressure to reopen the economy intensifies, business leaders are searching for ways to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection for their workers and customers. An alluring idea is to offer testing on site, keeping those who are positive out of the workplace.

Testing seems to offer a combination of confidence building for employees and liability protection for companies. Some employers are even pursuing mandatory testing, which is permitted by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

So, should universal testing in the workplace become part of the new normal?

Not yet. Given technical and resource limitations, testing is no more than one piece of the puzzle of infection prevention and control. There are three major reasons why it would be a mistake for employers to rely heavily or exclusively on testing for safety:

Social distancing vital even with tests

►Sufficient testing is difficult to put in place at even moderate scale. Testing for active SARS-CoV-2 infection is based on identifying the genetic material of the virus in a sample taken from the back of the throat or the nose. (Saliva testing also is promising.) For one person at a time, with certain machines, results are possible within as little as 15 minutes. When dozens or hundreds of samples are needed, however, samples need to be run in tandem on larger machines, and the results are likely to take hours.

If you ask people to wait a day for the results, that’s another day when latent infection could manifest itself, and another test would be needed. And so on. New rapid “antigen” tests are unlikely to solve this problem, given weaknesses with their accuracy.

Pooling saliva samples from the whole workplace is a potential way to search for the coronavirus at lower cost. This strategy, however, takes additional time for sample collection and laboratory work. It also requires follow-up testing should the pooled sample prove positive.

►Negative test results do not eliminate the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the workplace. The accuracy of the test depends on when it is performed in an individual’s course of infection. Many asymptomatic people with SARS-CoV-2 infection could test negative — especially if they are in the pre-symptomatic but infectious phase. As a result, even the world’s most robust testing program would not eliminate the need for social distancing within an office or retail setting. One missed infection in someone who attends a packed staff meeting will require the whole office to quarantine.

COVID protection: Workplaces aren't ready for mass reopening. First we need standards to keep workers safe.

►Employer testing at scale could lead to shortages of testing supplies and compromise the ability of health care facilities to test people who develop symptoms. Consultants offering testing to businesses may go straight to suppliers of swabs, reagents and testing machines and outbid public health agencies and clinics. If even a fraction of workplaces attempts regular testing, the demands could far exceed capacity.

Less testing of those at greatest risk of infection will mean fewer opportunities for isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, the core components of controlling community spread. As cases in a community rise, so too will the likelihood of infections penetrating every workplace.

Sick leave, screenings and ventilation

Rather than as a magic wand, employers should look at testing as a potential piece of a comprehensive infection prevention and control strategy.

Employers should provide generous sick leave and quarantine benefits, screen employees and customers for symptoms before they come to the workplace, and reengineer the work environment to maintain at least 6 feet of distance and high levels of ventilation. They should focus on ways to promote hand hygiene, social distancing, environmental disinfection, and rapid identification and contact tracing for employees who develop COVID-19.

False choice:Protesters should demand coronavirus safety and a reopened economy. We can have both.

Regular testing is most appropriate for small cohorts of people who are unable to socially distance at work and who are exposed to the public in close quarters. Indeed, such testing could prove to be of high utility in very high-risk settings, such as nursing homes. Broad testing is also important in the setting of an outbreak, as directed by public health agencies.

Testing alone, however, is insufficient as an infection prevention and control strategy. A test might find the novel coronavirus, but only careful planning, policy changes, reengineering the workplace and social distancing can stop it from spreading. There are no shortcuts to defeating COVID-19.

Think of your favorite small business. It might be the corner shop where you grab coffee on the way to work, the barbershop where you get your hair cut, or the restaurant you take your kids to on special occasions. Now imagine how much you’d miss it if it disappeared.

If you live in University City, Missouri, it might be EyeSeeMe — a book shop with a difference. Inspired by their four kids, Pamela and Jeffrey Blair created a place where black children can discover role models and learn about African American history. It has become an important part of the community, serving people in their store and working with schools, day care and colleges to educate kids across the local area.

But the coronavirus pandemic turned everything upside down. Their store, like so many others, closed its doors. Pamela and Jeffrey have used all their creativity to try to make their business work online. They’re pushing online sales, selling subscriptions to boxes of books delivered every two weeks, and hosting story time readings with authors on Facebook Live. But they’ve had to rely on the goodwill of their community to stay afloat, raising money through a GoFundMe campaign.

A measure of COVID-19 shutdowns

Small businesses like EyeSeeMe are the heartbeat of our communities, and they're in real trouble. The new State of Small Business Report by Facebook and the Small Business Roundtable shows just how much.

Based on a survey of 86,000 owners, managers and workers in U.S. companies with fewer than 500 employees, the report is a sobering snapshot of the struggle they find themselves in. Since the first shelter-in-place orders, it has been clear that many businesses were going to take a big hit, but now we can hear from the people behind the businesses just how big it is.

Nearly a third told us they have stopped operating entirely. For the smallest businesses — those run by the self-employed or for personal income — the situation is worse. More than half are no longer operating. That is especially bad for women, who run the majority of these businesses.

A particularly concerning finding is that fewer than half of those surveyed said they expected to be able to rehire the same workers when they reopen. And many businesses that remain in operation face two big challenges: cash and customers. Nearly three in 10 said the biggest challenge they face over the next few months will be cash flow, while 20% said it will be lack of demand.

Like Pamela and Jeffrey, many are trying to pivot their operations online. Just over half said they were increasing their online interaction with customers, with more than a third now doing all their selling virtually.

Running a small business is tiring in the best of times. But as the report illustrates so starkly, the challenges of staying afloat during this turmoil can be overwhelming. Nearly half of all owners and managers report feeling burned out trying to take care of business and household responsibilities at the same time.

Few expect their businesses to fail

Yet despite all this, there is huge resilience and a surprising amount of optimism. More than half of those surveyed said they are optimistic or extremely optimistic about the future of their businesses, and a small fraction — just 11% — expect their business to fail if conditions persist for the next three months.

Facebook is in the business of small business. Some 160 million businesses use our apps every month — nearly one business for every 55 people on the planet, all using Facebook, Instagram, Messenger or WhatsApp to reach customers. Big brands use them, as do local coffee shops, barbershops, restaurants and, yes, bookstores. And for every one of those 160 million, there are people earning livelihoods and customers using products or services.

The State of Small Business Report is the first of an ongoing series tracking the situation facing small businesses across the country. These were planned before the virus struck, and we had anticipated that they would paint a much brighter picture of American businesses. Instead, the findings bring home the scale of the crisis our economy is facing and can point us to where help is most needed.

Above all, we hope that the optimism of small business owners is well-founded, and that future reports will tell a story of recovery and better times to come.

As strange as it may sound, we need to plan now for a dynamic post-pandemic world.

The unique circumstances of the crisis have unleashed a wave of innovation and prompted unprecedented levels of regulatory relief as we deal with both a health and an economic crisis.

Hundreds, if not thousands, of rules and regulations at the federal and state levels have been lifted or relaxed during the pandemic.

At the same time, American workers — from employees in large companies to gig hustlers — are adapting and innovating in new ways and at new speeds. Our “new normal” in the future should incorporate lessons learned from this period.

Congress could help by creating an independent commission to study how laws and regulations inhibited or facilitated innovation and adaptation during the crisis. Dynamism means much more than “light touch” regulatory agencies. It is also about encouraging a culture of creative experimentation at all levels of the economy.

The innovation we are seeing during the crisis, from accelerated drug approvals to small-scale personal protective equipment production, should help guide our regulatory reform efforts in the future.

The national commission should include state representatives among its members, or encourage parallel state commissions, because many limits to dynamism exist at the state level. Previous ideas for regulatory commissions, both in the United States and abroad, could serve as a model for Congress.

4 ways to drive innovation

Initially, the commission could concentrate on four factors that have been revolutionized by innovation during the pandemic:

►Speed. COVID-19 has forced many companies to discard protocols to adapt to our new reality. The most obvious example is in pharmaceutical development. It hasn’t been perfect, but drug companies and regulators are learning to share information more effectively and undo requirements that slow progress.

Share your coronavirus story: Contact USA TODAY Opinion's hotline. We may publish your comments.

The commission could look at how new information and supercomputing systems — together with simpler, more standardized clinical trials — could lower costs and speed up drug development.

More generally, during the pandemic, companies have been reinventing processes and systems practically overnight, from supply chain management in food delivery to sporting goods purchases and 3D printing. A commission should study the manner in which the regulatory environment interacted with such innovation, whether positively or negatively.

►Distance. The process for removing barriers to physical distance will accelerate after the crisis. One obvious example is telemedicine. There is no need to go to the doctor’s office unless medically necessary; yet state licensing and referral laws complicate telehealth and should be reworked.

Distance learning has now become the norm by the sheer force of school closures, and parents and employers understandably want to see kids back in school as soon as possible. But new opportunities for remote learning models should emerge from this experience, and state requirements should adapt to them.

Other distance-reducing technologies range from increasing the use of drones to deliver products to expanded broadband access to rural areas, all of which have implications for regulatory frameworks.

►Health. New ways of detecting and dealing with health threats are set to proliferate because of the coronavirus. Innovation on this front is already exploding. From reusable protective masks, to health apps that detect symptoms and deliver medical advice, to detection kits that produce immediate results for multiple viruses, the pandemic has prompted a wave of innovation that will improve our quality of life.

We may even have robots in our offices and homes one day that can kill viruses and bacteria without using chemicals, and technology that can “smell” whether viruses are in a room in the first place.

►Business. We should pay special attention to reforms that promote greater adaptability and flexibility, especially among smaller businesses and sole proprietors. The pandemic has prompted a lot of adaptive repurposing in a number of sectors, from local distillers producing hand sanitizer to electronics firms producing protective masks.

Encourage flexibility in business

Our rules should encourage maximum adaptability and flexibility, such as with 3D printing that has allowed small and large companies to fill in gaps in the supply chain. Fintech, the integration of technology into financial services, has grown considerably during the pandemic and made commercial activity easier for small businesses and gig workers.

Rules that inhibit adaptability, such as limits on what health care workers and hospitals can do to meet needs, should be up for review.

We need dynamism to get us through the crisis, and we will need it as we rebuild our economy afterward. Thinking now about how that should look is incredibly important.

In the spring of 1920, spirits in America ran surprisingly high. Despite being in the midst of a temporary economic contraction, the forces that brought about our nation’s infamous booze ban — a blend of progressive elites, religious groups and anti-immigrant advocates — were ecstatic.

In addition to celebrating their political victory in the 18th Amendment, they were already applauding Prohibition for curing many of society’s worst ills. News coverage was often gushing. In January 1921, The Times-Picayune inNew Orleans felt confident enough to (dubiously) assert that Prohibition had created “more money for the poor, more money for the businessman, more money for the workman, more money in the banks.""

But the longer Prohibition wore on, the worse its impact became. Similar to other alcohol-banning experiments throughout human history, the higher the government raised the barriers to obtaining legal alcohol, the riskier the steps people took to get hooch. Black markets ran wild, followed by highly organized — and violent — criminal syndicates that turned booze smuggling into a lucrative business. Americans grew weary of the never-ending enforcement raids and expensive prosecutions.

Spirit of Prohibition is still with us

In 1933, barely a decade after it took effect, Prohibition was relegated to the dust bin of history. Well, at least that’s the popular version of the story. In reality, the 21st Amendment, which officially ushered in Prohibition’s repeal,granted state and local governments vast powers over alcohol. In the immediate aftermath of Prohibition, regulators used this newfound power to enact rules that severely limited access to booze.

Most producers were forced to sell their products through middlemen wholesalers, rather than being able to sell directly to customers. Some states took over wholesaling and retail markets for alcohol entirely. A complicated — and often expensive — licensing system arose that created substantial compliance headaches and a host of difficult to understand retailing rules.

As these laws ossified over time, protectionist forces resisted any attempts to modernize them. Licensees in one sector of the industry, such as restaurants, were often reluctant to allow other types of licensees to encroach on their territory. Powerful wholesalers continued to resist producers being granted the right to sell directly to the public.

Now, a century later, the COVID-19 crisis has triggered — virtually overnight — a mass rethinking of this sclerotic industry. Once the virus hit and government officials were forced to prioritize public health above all else, it became painfully apparent that many of our nation’s alcohol rules were not related to health or safety at all.

Many locales had long forbidden restaurants from selling to-go cocktails, but reform-minded officials started asking: Why? Finding no good answer, places like New York, Texas and Washington, D.C., promptly scrapped these restrictions and allowed carry-out drinks.

Home alone:Ancient advice for drinking at home during coronavirus self-quarantine

Likewise, breweries and distilleries have traditionally been prohibited from delivering beer and spirits in many states, but again, was there any real reason for this? Numerous states decided there was not: Kentucky passed landmark legislation allowing producers of all types of alcohol to ship products directly to in-state customers, while Virginia permanently granted distilleries the right to hand deliver spirits.

Restrictions aren't always safe

At the same time, states like Pennsylvania conveniently demonstrated how a prohibitionist mentality toward alcohol was not only unrelated to health and safety but sometimes actively antithetical to it.

When COVID hit, Pennsylvania shuttered its system of government-run Fine Wine and Good Spirits stores, which led to residents flooding across the border to liquor stores in neighboring states like Ohio, West Virginia and New Jersey. If anything, Pennsylvania’s response jeopardized public health by incentivizing residents to travel far distances rather than sheltering in place.

Crammed into bars:Wisconsin's reopening and it's a hot coronavirus mess. Don't do what we did.

To be sure, there are legitimate state interests around health, safety and welfare when it comes to alcohol. Government has important and laudable goals such as preventing the sale and service of alcohol to minors and intoxicated individuals, limiting negative consequences like drunken driving, and establishing basic rules to stop fraudulent or dangerous products from reaching the market.

At the end of the day, however, alcohol products are not substantially different from many other types of products we regulate in a more modern way. For instance, at the same time many states were restricting alcohol delivery, they were allowing home delivery of pharmaceutical products.

It’s unfortunate that it has taken an international pandemic to force America to reconsider its outdated and protectionist system of alcohol rules. But for the first time in a century, we may finally be turning the page on our prohibitionist past.

Some curious photos began rocketing around social media sites Wednesday night — pictures of people in Wisconsin once again in their natural habitat, crammed shoulder to shoulder in bars.

Fortunately, the patrons were not drinking shots of flaming Lysol or Cloroxtinis. Unfortunately, there were no masks to be found, and the only thing drinkers were distancing from were their inhibitions. Just hours earlier, the Wisconsin Supreme Court had struck down a statewide ""safer at home"" order that, among other things, closed “nonessential” businesses and ordered people to stay in their homes, with limited exceptions. The order itself was fairly standard for states across America.

For weeks, Republicans had argued that their lawsuit against the order was needed simply so the legislature could have some say in the reopening plan. ""We want not a Democratic plan, not a Republican plan, we want a Wisconsin plan where we're all working together,” Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke said May 7.

But now it appears their plan all along was to thwart any plan. Now that they’ve been granted a seat at the table, Republicans have set the table on fire and thrown it out the window.

GOP argued Dem order was confusing

The governor’s unilateral “safer at home"" order was set to expire May 26, at which point a gradual reopening would continue to take place. (Some business restrictions have already been lifted.)

But Republicans in the Wisconsin Legislature challenged the order, complaining that the governor, through his health secretary-designee, had both cut them out of the process and exceeded his authority. They took Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to court, emerging victorious on Wednesday.

The ruling leaves Wisconsin without any statewide rule or guidance in place for businesses, citizens and local governments. After the decision, Republicans said they didn’t see any need for any new rules, instead turning the state into a patchwork of local COVID-19 regulations, stretched throughout nearly 2,000 counties, cities, villages and towns. (Ironically, in the lawsuit, GOP attorneys argued that the statewide order was confusing — but without the order, every local government may now have different regulations and expiration dates.)

This is all taking place in a state that has weathered a decade of all-out partisan war, dating to the days of 2011 when tens of thousands of people occupied the state Capitol protesting Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to virtually eliminate public sector collective bargaining. After an attempt to recall Walker failed, state politics has grown more bitter, culminating in Republicans forcing citizens to vote in-person during a spring election on April 7.

False choices:Protesters should demand coronavirus safety and a reopened economy. We can have both.

The lawsuit itself was based on a preposterous argument: The legislature argued that the health secretary’s “order,” which, according to state statute does not require legislative oversight, was instead a “rule,” which can be vetoed by lawmakers. But the extremely broad statute granting the executive branch emergency powers explicitly separates the two, saying the department ""may promulgate and enforce rules or issue orders for guarding against the introduction of any communicable disease” (my emphasis). In fact, the legislature specifically added the authority for the governor to issue unilateral orders back in 1982, when the state was grappling with the rapid spread of AIDS.

Basically, the Wisconsin Legislature argued in favor of disregarding a law passed by … the Wisconsin Legislature.

Rush to bars doesn't inspire hope

Nonetheless, as pointed out by liberal Justice Rebecca Dallet in her dissent, four conservative members of the court who won elections by campaigning against the idea of judges writing new laws went ahead and wrote a whole new law merging “orders” with “rules.”

“A majority of this court falls hook, line and sinker for the legislature's tactic to rewrite a duly enacted statute through litigation rather than legislation,” wrote Dallet, adding that “this decision will undoubtedly go down as one of the most blatant examples of judicial activism in this court's history.” (One conservative justice, Brian Hagedorn, sided with the liberal judges in the three-justice minority.)

Coronavirus pause:People need people, but it's risky to resume social activities so soon

Having been abandoned by the state, at least 17 communities immediately instituted stay-at-home orders of their own to continue the success the state has had in mitigating the damage of the virus. But on Friday, despite an attorney general opinion that said local governments do have the power to issue such orders as long as there are no criminal penalties attached, at least eight local governments rescinded their orders, leaving their communities unprotected. (The state’s two largest cities, Milwaukee and Madison, kept their regulations, believing they are lawful.)

Ultimately, it is now up to the state’s citizens to practice responsible distancing, wear masks and take other necessary precautions. But the rush to get back to the bars does not inspire confidence that everyone will be taking this seriously enough. At the end of a long night of drinking, beer goggles no doubt make COVID-19 look pretty enticing.

One month ago, as COVID-19 spread across the county and critical personal protective equipment like masks, gloves, surgical gowns and face shields continued to be in short supply, I had hoped the government would do its job and act to meet this demand. But when news outlets reported that medical workers were being left vulnerable to infection without PPE, it was clear we couldn't wait for the Trump administration any longer.

A small group of volunteers came together to found Masks for America and teamed up with leading health care activist Ady Barkan's Be A Hero Fund, Social Security Works and National Nurses United to get our front-line heroes the equipment they needed to stay safe as they saved lives.

As the federal government failed to provide essential equipment, our small group of volunteers has successfully delivered nearly 200,000 FDA-certified, CDC-approved KN95 masks to front-line workers in hard hit areas — New York City, Detroit, New Orleans, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico — in just a matter of weeks. But it wasn’t easy, because when the federal government finally decided to act, it wasn’t the way we had expected. Instead of helping us, they seized some of our PPE shipments without telling us where they were taking them.

Unprecedented federal interference

On April 11, during the peak of COVID-19 cases and deaths in New York City, the Federal Emergency Management Agency intervened and demanded orders of medical equipment allocated to our relief efforts be redirected to the federal government. FEMA then seized 50,000 N95 respirators we had ordered without giving us an explanation or telling us where those respirators were going.

In my 15 years of working in the manufacturing industry with international and domestic supply chains, I have never — never — had the federal government interfere like this.

It wasn’t long before I realized it wasn’t only happening in New York and New Jersey. FEMA confiscated San Francisco’s PPE order as it went through customs, even as the Trump administration told states and cities to procure their own equipment rather than rely on the federal government. Since those reports of FEMA quietly seizing materials, at least six states have lodged similar complaints against the federal government interfering with their supply chains.

Over 100 health leaders to governors:Require masks to help contain COVID-19

It is not illegal for the government to seize and distribute medical shipments through the Defense Production Act, yet our government has failed to be transparent with the public about how and why it is redistributing the resources of cities, states and private organizations like ours.

The struggle to secure PPE and medical supplies isn’t just a failure of leadership in our government but also an unsustainable supply chain issue that has been bubbling just under the surface for years.

Bring manufacturing back to America

Over the past two decades, I’ve fought as our nation offshored millions of American manufacturing jobs overseas. Most PPE and other medical equipment is now made in China, which has led to increased difficulty for the government to produce and distribute crucial resources during a disaster. This, in addition to FEMA’s track record of inefficiency and failure to provide adequate disaster relief, has led to the government’s shortage and is likely why officials are taking equipment from a small volunteer-driven coalition that was able to leverage its resources and know-how to do the job they couldn’t do.

HOTLINE:Share your coronavirus story

International production lines are taking weeks to deliver the resources we need to keep people alive. If we were manufacturing PPE and medical supplies in the United States, it would take mere days to deliver protection to front-line essential workers where it’s needed. Reshoring the production of PPE and other essential public health resources permanently could also bring millions of good manufacturing jobs home, at a time when more than 36 million Americans have filed for unemployment.

As we approach 1.5 million confirmed U.S. cases of COVID-19 and 89,000 deaths, with thousands more projected daily, it’s clearer than ever that we as a nation will need to hold our government accountable for the series of systemic failures that led us to the point of FEMA seizing PPE from nurses, state governments and nonprofit relief efforts without explanation or transparency.

Epidemiologist Q&A:‘We're just in the second inning of a nine-inning game’

While there is much to learn from this ongoing pandemic, one thing is clear — for our nation's public health and national security, Congress must take immediate action to reshore PPE and medical supply production lines back into the United States. Otherwise, we’ll continue to be vulnerable, doomed to repeat the deadly missteps of this pandemic.

The coronavirus projections coming from experts have two major components: How mobile we are (that is, are we leaving home) and how well we “socially distance” to six feet or more unless we are wearing a mask. The other parts of the models are important, but all are easier to predict on the basis of what happened in each locality when 100% of the country was supposed to be on “lockdown.”

This isn’t that complicated. Since the projections are based to a real extent on mobility and distancing, by definition the projections will change as we open up the economy and how we do it. We will be heading right back toward the same deadly peaks unless we socially distance — because social distancing is how we got the curves to go down in the first place.

Wear a donut or use a hockey stick

►This 6-foot separation is not a joke and people are just plain irresponsible if they don’t pay attention to it. A man in Italy has created a 6-foot donut to wear; Canadians use hockey sticks. In Germany, a restaurant gave patrons hats with pool noodles on them to remind them to distance. We need an easy foldable device; patent it and make millions.

“It won't happen to me!” That’s not the issue. Everyone gets counted in the projections – including the people on the beach. We are already seeing it. The latest projections are 147,000 U.S. deaths by August. This is more than double the projections just a month ago. What happened? Better modeling? No. Massive uprising against social distancing? Yes. If we don’t social distance, and soon, numbers will reach the tipping point and locality by locality, we will all be forced to stay home — just like last time. No one wants that!

►That 6-foot distance has been determined scientifically, but I am concerned with the effectiveness of the masks we are wearing at distances less than six feet. If they don’t work then this is the worst case of more certain transmission. We should only be able to buy masks that prevent transmission to, say two feet, when worn correctly. Each mask should have instructions enclosed for how to wear it. I have an N95 mask, and it is difficult to breathe. Hopefully other masks can be effective for those who are not first responders.

When do negative tests expire?

►Testing for presence of the virus. As we increase testing (and hopefully make it more accurate), we of course need to understand that just the math will decrease the number of cases per million people. A nationally-comparable statistic must be developed and continually published that accounts for increased testing or we will develop a false sense of security “blaming” the increase in positives on increased testing. Publishing each state’s number of tests per million people and number of positives per million people will help to avoid the false sense of security by “blaming” the increase in positives on increased testing.

Coronavirus pause: People need people, but it's risky to resume social activities so soon

There is an important issue raised by people in the White House not wearing masks and turning positive. All had been tested negative – until they weren’t. So we must ask the question, “How long is a negative test good for?” Maybe three days or five days? At least food in the grocery store has an expiration date. No one has told us the expiration date for a negative test.

Nobody is no-risk in Russian Roulette

Everyone who is tested once as negative has to be re-tested very frequently. Same for the contact tracing. Have we dialed those numbers into our testing procedures? If we don’t test this frequently, then we are kidding ourselves that testing means anything: you are negative until you are exposed to the next positive person who may be asymptomatic.

Does everyone need to be tested for the virus, or for antibodies? Some have said no. But if not, then how do we deal with the five presumably low risk people who contracted the virus recently at a birthday party where no one was social distancing or wearing a mask? Seems like a game of Russian Roulette; you can't predict who gets the bullet.

Reaching teens:Why are young people so bad at coronavirus social distancing? Blame their brains.

Pay close attention to Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York, which has returned to where it was March 19 in deaths and hospitalizations. New York is re-opening extremely carefully. If the hospitalizations and deaths in New York, start back up, I believe we will see that for the rest of the country.

From what we know today, until there is a vaccine that is available and works for all, we are stuck with this virus and must socially distance and wear masks. Every one of us can do that right now. If we don’t, it won't be their problem, it will be your personal problem when we are all shut back in. Right around election time.

Ceremony. Merriam Webster defines it as “a formal act or series of acts prescribed by ritual, protocol, or convention.” But what do you do when a pandemic makes ritual, protocol, and convention impossible? “Celebrate” is “to perform (a sacrament or solemn ceremony) publicly and with appropriate rites.” Publicly.

It feels indulgent, to grieve such a small loss. My family remains alive and uninfected. We are not saying that last goodbye by phone to a loved one dying in a hospital room without our hand to hold. We are not postponing that ultimate of ceremonies, the funeral. We are not having to bear that ultimate of griefs alone.

The loss of ceremony is not even the hardest thing my son has had to endure in his relatively short life. Not even close. And he starts his dream job at a university July 1. He won’t even suffer a health insurance gap.

And yet I cry in the shower, as do, I suppose, millions of us all over the world. We grieve the chance to celebrate those we love in what used to be the big moments in life, in the time before every moment of life itself seemed so very big. Moments that, all over the world, and for all of human history, have been marked by ceremony.

Pandemic life:We're slouching toward graduation at home with our college senior

No flipping of tassels or tossing of graduation caps this May and June. Not for college students or law students or Ph.D.s. Not for high schools. Not for middle schools or preschools. Not for medical students, many of whom are already out working in the fight to defeat this virus. Even the U.S. Naval Academy, where the hat-tossing tradition began in 1912, tossed theirs this year without the benefit of an audience to applaud.

No dancing at weddings or comic stuffing of cake bites into newlywed mouths. No babies crying over baptismal fonts. No awkward student welcomes and get-to-know-yous over the summer. Birthdays. Anniversaries. Publication parties. Film premieres. Retirements. Not even a Mother’s Day brunch for most of us.

Easter teleconference to meet a baby

This spring, there will be none of those moments we photograph and paste into scrap books, share with our virtual friends, and set out in frames for years to come.

So we adapt, of course. My niece introduces her new daughter into the family by Easter teleconference. My nephew considers delaying a fall wedding until we can all gather again. Zoom becomes a verb with a new meaning, and we have never been so grateful to be living in the time of video technology that was the stuff of television-show fiction when many of us were growing up.

My son, like so many graduates this year, will attend a virtual commencement and a “special online event” for some smaller group of Ph.D. candidates or economists, the details of which are being worked out now.

He will also be feted in person “sometime later, once we know it is safe to bring people together again,” his university president assures us. That celebration will come with “all of the pomp, circumstance, and tradition that is typical” of their commencements, and “as many of the traditional campus festivities that typically precede commencement as possible.”

The push to release inmates to protect populations inside and outside of prison from COVID-19 has exposed our institutional trigger finger when it comes to locking people up.

About 40% of the incarcerated population doesn’t present a public safety concern, according to a 2016 Brennan Center for Justice report. If our system was more justice oriented and less punitive, we wouldn’t now be scrambling for so many compassionate releases.

Getting “tough on crime” was supposed to rehabilitate society, clear it of repetitively malignant socioeconomic outcomes across communities and create a permanent feeling of safety. Instead it has done nothing but overcrowd prisons, making each a petri dish for COVID-19. This explosive combination of unnecessarily high incarceration rates and a global pandemic accelerates the need to create a better, more holistic approach to justice in America.

In the wake of COVID-19 and tightening state and federal budgets, there is an opportunity for significant nationwide expansion of alternatives to incarceration and detention, and impactful reform of the justice system.

COLUMN:Ben Crump: Ahmaud Arbery killing reminiscent of lynching

Here are three changes that could fundamentally redefine our criminal justice system: practicing restorative justice, implementing misdemeanor reform and passing legislation that would eliminate punishment for parole violations.

Restorative justice, not punitive justice

Punitive justice focuses primarily on punishments. Restorative justice focuses on the relationship between the offender and the victim and centers the needs of survivors in ways that the traditional court system does not.

Programs based on this approach are being used right now in youth courts, such as the Red Hook Community Justice Center and Harlem Community Justice Center, and by Impact Justice’s Restorative Justice Project. The work interrupts the cycle of offending, repairs harm caused to the victim and the community, and incorporates restorative healing circles.

Restorative justice programs have higher survivor satisfaction rates than punitive systems.

Programs like Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion in Seattle are also important. The program partners civilians with local police to divert offenders to needed resources without making an arrest.

Misdemeanor reforms

Misdemeanors make the U.S. criminal justice system a profit center. They make up 80% of state criminal dockets, putting throngs of people into U.S. jails and prisons.

COLUMN:During COVID-19 crisis, prioritize release of pregnant inmates

Misdemeanors vary in severity from jaywalking to unpaid parking tickets and third-degree assault. While the latter may need stronger consequences, facing jail time for not being able to pay a speeding ticket or jaywalking isn’t just.

Misdemeanor shouldn't be done away with, but our justice system must enforce appropriate consequences for offenses rather than disproportionate punishments.

Don't arrest for parole violations

Passing legislation that would eliminate parole violations would go a long way toward keeping people out of prisons and jails who don't belong there.

New York City's Less is More Act is a great example of how to get that done. The act, if passed, would eliminate technical parole violations. The state's taxpayers spent million of dollars last year incarcerating folks for technical parole violations. New York wouldn't be the first to take steps that eliminate parole violations. After South Carolina adopted sanctions — which included disciplinary actions outside of incarceration — violations decreased and recidivism dropped.

Permitting people to earn accelerated discharge off community supervision will responsibly shrink the number of people subject to such supervision, and allow us to concentrate our finite resources on those who are most in need of attention.

We have tried punitive measures. We’ve gotten “tough on crime,” and what has resulted are broken people, shattered communities, and a system of courts, law enforcement divisions and prison operations that depend financially on the incarceration of Americans.

COLUMN:Former felons should not be pushed out of loans under CARES Act

We cannot continue this way and consider ourselves a free and peaceful society.

Committing to restorative justice and implementing reforms will restructure the justice system, reduce the burden on the taxpayer and extend the compassionate action that has been a rallying point during COVID-19.

We’ve learned during the pandemic that how we treat each other, whether down the hall or across town, impacts our collective freedom and health; it’s time to extend generosity and love to our neighbors who have been impacted by the justice system.

Andrea Circle Bear was 30 years old and had only recently given birth when she died of COVID-19. Circle Bear was incarcerated for a drug-related charge at the time of her death. She spent the final weeks of her pregnancy in a local jail and then a federal prison, spaces that are known hotbeds for virus transmission — and it’s likely in one of these places that she contracted the virus. She shared the planet with her baby for only 28 days before she passed.

While much attention has rightly been given to the risks of COVID-19 in prisons, jails, and detention centers, the risks to pregnant and postpartum women like Circle Bear have largely been overlooked.

Pregnancy alone does not appear to be a risk factor for severe illness from COVID-19, but the data is clear that incarceration compounds the dangers associated with pregnancy. They are much more likely to get infected in prison or jail than in the community.

COLUMN:Ben Crump: Ahmaud Arbery killing reminiscent of lynching

People who are incarcerated also have higher rates of underlying medical conditions —as Circle Bear did — that put them at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness. Some suggest that people in prisons or jails who have symptoms of COVID-19, including those who are pregnant, be placed in solitary confinement as a form of quarantine. But solitary confinement can be especially damaging to prison or jail populations that are pregnant or have recently given birth because it can limit access to timely, adequate medical care.

During this time of rampant coronavirus spread and attempts at social distancing to avoid infection, it's imperative that pregnant populations are prioritized for release and diversion from prisons, jails and detention centers.

The situation is dire.

A new study estimates that at least 72% of people held in immigration detention centers are likely to get infected within the next 90 days. And the danger in jails and prisons is equally serious: Prisons that have conducted universal testing have found that an overwhelming number of the people they incarcerated are positive for COVID-19. One model estimates that 100,000 more people could die from COVID-19 than current estimates indicate if jail populations are not immediately and dramatically reduced.

COLUMN:Former felons should not be pushed out of loans under CARES Act

A recent study that I conducted as a doctor and Johns Hopkins OBGYN researcher estimated that from 2016 to 2017, there were nearly 3,000 admissions of pregnant women to U.S. prisons and 55,000 to jails. Thousands are at risk for contracting COVID in custody and exposing their babies to danger.

As a physician and an attorney who work with populations that are pregnant and incarcerated, we have seen dangerous variability in their care. There is a dearth of protections for them, leaving many vulnerable to inadequate medical care and abuse: loss of reproductive choices, shackling during childbirth and solitary confinement, as well as the inevitable separation from their newborns.

The COVID-19 pandemic is terrifying for anyone who is pregnant. Those who are incarcerated are wrestling with the added COVID risks of their environment, such as close quarters, lack of adequate cleaning and limited protective equipment. These fears only exacerbate the existing dangers and stressors of being pregnant while incarcerated. Pregnancy, incarceration and COVID are a recipe for both increased medical risks and psychological trauma.

COLUMN:I'm a nurse battling against COVID-19, but DACA fight could end in my deportation

Having coronavirus also may mean being separated from newborns at the hospital. This would be a difficult experience for any new parent, but it is particularly devastating and harmful for those who are incarcerated because they are quickly sent back to the prison or jail, unable to see or hold their infants. And since prisons and jails have suspended visitations as a COVID prevention measure, the few opportunities new parents might have had for contact visits are gone. These traumatic separations interfere with their ability to bond with their children and cause severe emotional harm — for both the parent and the child.

Advocates and officials have made tremendous and rapid strides in depopulating prisons and jails, often focusing on releasing those who are medically vulnerable to COVID-19. We have seen success in some places. In North Carolina, more than a dozen pregnant women were moved out of prison last month. But more efforts are needed.

The situation for pregnant populations in our nation’s jails, prisons and detention centers has long been serious. But with COVID-19, it is now an emergency.

Circle Bear’s child should never have been left motherless, and she should not have had to face the dangers of incarceration, where she contracted COVID-19.

We must and we can prevent such senseless suffering.

Editor's note:The following letter to Congress is signed by 110 former members of Congress, Cabinet secretaries, ambassadors and governors. The project was organized by the Issue One ReFormers Caucus, co-chaired by former U.S. Ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Connie Morella, a Republican from Maryland; former U.S. Ambassador to India Tim Roemer, a Democrat from Indiana; and former Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn.

As former public servants and concerned American citizens, we are deeply worried about the twin threats of a pandemic combined with severe economic peril, and we strongly encourage our government to work together for common purpose for the United States.

First, we can all agree that our democratic republic must efficiently function and serve all Americans, especially those most vulnerable to sickness and those unemployed from devastating economic fallout. Recovery will demand the best of our spirit, determination and perseverance.

A trusted and effective Congress — one that lives up to its Article I duties — is a vital part of this solution.

Second, we hope America will unite in its efforts to protect people from contracting the virus, care for those who have taken ill and help others through painful economic hardship.

Furthermore, while there will be a deeply passionate and fully competitive election in November, let’s work to ensure fair and secure access to the ballot for all eligible voters.

We know history books will closely examine how our elected leaders handle this pandemic and what action is taken to strengthen our republic, and, in turn, prepare our institutions for the next national challenge.

Congress, to its credit, has acted quickly to pass three stimulus bills signed by President Donald Trump to address the COVID-19 crisis. However, both the House and Senate must make important institutional reforms to restore the people’s trust, work smarter and more securely with technology, retain and hire a diversified and highly trained staff, and spend more time performing their constituent jobs and less time raising campaign money.

Work has already begun to bring the House to the 21st century thanks to the bipartisan leadership of the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress, who recently passed nearly 30 recommendations to strengthen and modernize the House of Representatives. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Republican leader Kevin McCarthy and other House officials have devoted precious political capital to begin this modernization process, and we applaud and thank them for their efforts.

The Senate also needs to engage on these issues, and much more needs to be done to restore the institution overall. More than 70 former senators recently published a letter encouraging the Senate to explore efforts to work in a bipartisan fashion and exert their constitutional authority.

Build on pandemic relief efforts

Especially during this international health pandemic and looming global recession, it is critical that our elected leaders build on the bipartisanship of COVID-19 relief efforts and model the cooperation demonstrated by the evenly bipartisan group of 12 representatives of the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress, led by Rep. Derek Kilmer, D-Wash., and Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ga., and address the vital needs of the country. We are hopeful that once this crisis has subsided, there will be an even broader, bicameral conversation about reinforcing Congress’ Article I, Section I role as our nation’s primary legislative authority.

Strong Congress is essential

If this pandemic has taught us anything about our political system, it’s that a robust and resilient Congress — one that operates as the first branch of government — is essential to the safety and security of our republic and all its citizens. To quote Alexis de Tocqueville’s ""Democracy in America,"" “The greatness of America lies not in being more enlightened than any other nation, but rather in her ability to repair her faults.”

In this spirit, we hope that leaders in both chambers of Congress will harness the moments following this grave and uncertain time and boldly lead to restore the institution. Our country will be stronger for it.

I have no hope that Donald Trump will ever behave like a president of all 50 United States. But I ask one simple thing from him and his son: Please stop trying to get my fellow Americans killed.

It’s impossible to keep track of all the norms Trump is petulantly stomping on as he runs for reelection amid the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression.

As the American death toll from COVID-19 has moved closer to 100,000, he has fired inspector general after inspector general, the only independent watchdogs inside the executive branch. His lawyers have argued before the Supreme Court that this president should essentially be immune from all prosecution and oversight, denying taxpayers the right to know whether he’s even a taxpayer. And @realdonaldtrump has gone into overdrive with his wild tweets and rhetoric, which he has to know could make his more unhinged supporters think he’s hoping they’ll get violent.

And some seem to be getting the message!

Trump's troubling QAnon retweets

Detroit real estate agent Robert Sinclair Tesh has been arraigned on a terrorism charge after he made what authorities determined were credible death threats against Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel. We can’t say for sure whether the man behind the alleged threats was a Trump fan. But he does appear to be a fan of the conspiracy theory known as QAnon, having used hashtags associated with the movement.

This arrest ties together two of the most dangerous threads of what rhetoric professor Jennifer Mercieca describes as Trump’s “argument ad baculum” in her forthcoming book, ""Demagogue for President: The Rhetorical Genius of Donald Trump."" These “appeals to the stick,” or implicit threats of force or intimidation, are “used by a demagogue to attack and overwhelm opponents,” Mercieca writes.

Trump has literally incited Michiganders to rise up against their governor with a “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” tweet that former Assistant Attorney General Mary McCord called illegal. And he has cheered on the so-called protesters who’ve garnered national attention by flooding into Michigan’s Capitol brandishing firearms, something you’d never be allowed to do at an NRA convention when Vice President Mike Pence is speaking.

But it’s the connection to the QAnon movement that’s most troubling about this arrest.

While there are always oaky traces of a death cult inside the Republican Party — “pro-lifers” fulminating for unnecessary wars and executions — the calls to sacrifice American (especially older Americans) to “the economy” have become audible as the death toll from COVID-19 has risen.

But QAnon is a literal death cult. It imagines crimes, often cannibalism and pedophilia, that would justify the arrest and even execution of the president's opponents and enemies. And it’s also a domestic terror threat, according to liberal fake news sources such as the FBI.

What Republicans don't get: Donald Trump is our biggest obstacle to coronavirus recovery

Either violent people are attracted to this fantasy — which originally touted Trump as an all-powerful crusader bound to take down international child sex rings and now seems more interested in spreading COVID-19 misinformation to justify Trump’s panoply of failures — or individuals who are into Q just happen to enjoy making criminal threats or killing a family member with a sword.

Of course, the big joke of all this is that Trump is the guy who started a teen beauty pageant, and several former contestants said Trump walked in on them while they were in various states of undress. And the one big name child sex offender this administration has arrested — former Trump playmate Jeffrey Epstein — died mysteriously in the custody of Trump’s Department of Justice, an unresolved crime that stinks of a real conspiracy.

Still, the deluded QAnon cult chugs on as an implicit threat on Trump’s behalf. And the president has rewarded its fealty with at least 131 retweets.

Tickling death cult bone of dad's fans

Anyone paying any attention knows that when Donald Trump Jr. makes a joke about former Vice President Joe Biden being a pedophile, he’s trying to tickle the death cult bone of his dad's fan base. And when Don Jr. pretends to back off by then reiterating the charge, he’s showing that he has learned his daddy’s “I’m not saying; I'm just saying” rhetorical trick of paralipsis.

Mercieca says that's what demagogues use ""to circulate rumors and accusations, to ironically say two things at once, and to build a relationship with supporters.”

I get the desperation.

The Trumps' best attempt at digging up foreign dirt on Biden resulted in impeachment and the revelation that Biden was actually leading the international community’s efforts to fight corruption in Ukraine.

They haven’t found any attack on Biden yet that tanks him the way they smeared a woman for using personal email. And older voters are telling pollsters that they may be abandoning Trump. (Maybe because they’ve heard that some Republicans think they should stop complaining about COVID-19 and start dying.)

Trump impeachment intimidation: Weaponized Twitter feed, die-hard fans who get the 'code'

This is all bound to get more intense as Trump feels the risk of losing the one job in the United States that prevents him from being indicted. The question is how many people the Trumps are willing to take down with them.

The president’s steaming rhetoric may have influenced his superfan Cesar Sayoc, who was convicted of mailing bombs to 13 Trump opponents — including Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden. The only thing that saved us from this Trump fan carrying out one of the worst terror attacks in American history was his incompetence.

But as Trump’s election proved, competence isn’t necessary for success.

So please, Mr. President, stop trying to get us killed. COVID-19 is bad enough on its own.

During the COVID-19 public health emergency, the U.S. Department of Transportation is focused on keeping our country’s national airspace operational and safe. That includes protecting consumers, the aviation workforce, and the economic health of the airlines.

As Secretary of Transportation, I’m especially concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on airline passengers, many of whom may be facing financial uncertainty. So the department is closely monitoring airline practices regarding refunds, especially for reasons that are beyond the control of passengers. In fact, last week we announced additional steps to further protect consumers and make it easier for airlines to help boost the economic recovery.

As the Treasury Departmentcontinues to disburse $50 billion in support to the nation’s passenger airlines to protect their workers, the Department of Transportation has made it clear that cancellation and refund requirements are still in effect. In fact, they are more important than ever. Providing refunds is a long-standing practice when air travel has been disrupted on a large scale such as after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, Hurricane Katrina, and presidentially-declared natural disasters. DOT continues to emphasize the importance of refunds today.

Passengers deserve refunds

On April 3, 2020, DOT issued an Enforcement Notice reminding airlines that the law requires them to offer passengers prompt refunds for flights that are canceled or significantly delayed by the airline. Last week the department also issued an additional enforcement notice clarifying the obligations airlines have to paying customers, such as the definition of a “prompt” refund.

Meanwhile, DOT has received an unprecedented volume of complaints from passengers seeking refunds and is examining this issue closely to ensure that airlines’ policies and practices conform to its refund rules. The department will also examine any instances where an airline may have misled its passengers about the status of a flight in order to avoid having to offer ticket refunds.

Former Transportation secretary:Amid coronavirus collapse, airlines and the 10 million jobs they support need a lifeline

Many Americans, who canceled their reservations based on COVID-19 health concerns, are seeking refunds for the non-refundable tickets they purchased but could not use. After the president declared a national emergency on March 13 and states directed people to stay at home, it’s understandable that many people who had previously booked tickets for travel during the spring and summer months would have no choice but to cancel those bookings. They deserve fair treatment.

Voucher or credit may not be enough

Some airlines have issued credits that last several months or years, which is acceptable for some passengers. But to passengers who are pressed for money because of COVID-19, a voucher or credit may not be adequate. Only a handful of airlines have begun fully refunding these passengers. I am asking all airlines to reconsider their customer service policies, so that these policies are as flexible and considerate as possible to the needs of passengers. That’s so important for travelers who are facing financial hardship during this unprecedented time.

Sheryl Sandberg:Our new small business report shows scope of COVID struggles and optimism

Since the April 3 enforcement notice, some carriers have significantly improved their refund and credit policies. That is encouraging. Others should follow suit. Additionally, it’s important for our country’s economic recovery that the airlines continue maximum service to destinations all over America. The department has also taken steps to ensure this.

As always, the department’s commitment to the traveling public is at the forefront of everything we do.

""My eyes are getting watery because I found hand soap,"" my friend Raven Cooper shared in the group chat.

She followed up with a voice memo celebrating the momentous occasion that captured the hope, joy and excitement in her voice.

Pre-coronavirus, watery eyes and happy cries were reserved for promotions, birthday surprises and graduations, but now the simplest things are making us happy.

Cooper had been on the hunt for soap for the past two weeks as her supply was slowly dwindling down to its last few drops. With the widespread COVID-19 outbreak, commonplace and essential items like hand soap, toilet paper and disinfectant wipes have turned into luxury items.

Finding them is a cause for celebration, especially when it doesn't seem like there's much to celebrate.

IKEA's famous meatballs

Though many may know IKEA for its home furniture, the company also sells food and beverages in its in-store cafeterias.

In classic IKEA fashion, the company released its meatball recipe in the form of a construction diagram on Twitter. The directions reveal how to make the meatballs, as well as the ""iconic Swedish cream sauce"" that accompanies them, for four people.

Disney Parks' Mickey Mouse-shaped beignets

This recipe, shared by the Disney Parks Blog, recommends pairing these tasty treats typically found in the parks' New Orleans Square and Disney’s Port Orleans Resort – French Quarter with a viewing of ""The Princess and The Frog.""

Come hungry! This recipe makes 10 large Mickey Mouse-shaped beignets or 2 dozen small beignets.

Ingredients:

1/2 teaspoon dry yeast

1/4 cup warm water (105°)

1/4 cup sugar

2 tablespoons vegetable shortening

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/2 cup heavy cream

1 egg

4 cups all-purpose flour

1/2 cup boiling water

Vegetable oil for frying

Powdered sugar

Directions:

Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a small bowl, stirring to dissolve. Let stand for 5 minutes. Combine sugar, shortening, salt, heavy cream, egg, flour and boiling water in a large bowl; stir in yeast mixture. With the dough hook attachment of an electric mixer on medium speed, mix the dough just until combined and smooth. Let dough rest for 30 minutes. Roll to 1/4-inch thickness and cut individual beignets with a Mickey Mouse-shaped cutter or cut into 2 1/2 to 3-inch squares. Cover with a towel and let dough rise until doubled in size in a warm, draft-free area, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Using caution, heat 3 inches of vegetable oil to 350°F in a deep, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Fry beignets until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes, turning as soon as they brown on one side. Remove with tongs and place on paper towels to drain. Dust warm beignets with powdered sugar and serve immediately.

Disneyland's French toast

From Disney's PCH Grill at the Paradise Pier Hotel in Disneyland comes a sweet combo: chocolate, peanut butter and banana French toast. This recipe serves four.

Ingredients:

8 thick slices day-old challah bread

2 ripe bananas

1/4 cup chocolate chips

1/2 cup creamy peanut butter

6 eggs, lightly beaten

3/4 cup low-fat chocolate milk

Stir in chocolate chips. Combine peanut butter, eggs, chocolate milk, cinnamon and salt in a blender. Process until smooth. Pour egg mixture over bread mixture. Stir gently until bread cubes have absorbed egg mixture. Pour mixture into prepared baking pan. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until top is golden brown. Before serving, drizzle with chocolate syrup and dust with powdered sugar, if desired.

Disney Parks' famous Dole Whip

When many people think of Disneyland and the Walt Disney World Resort, the taste of pineapple Dole Whip, a soft-serve ice cream sold outside the classic Enchanted Tiki Room, may also come to mind.

Though the Tiki Room isn't taking visitors right now, the Disney app My Disney Experience has published how to make a fruity pineapple soft serve to fill the Dole Whip void. The following recipe serves four and takes five minutes to prep. (According to a recipe on Dole's website, the original soft serve is dairy-free, so you may want to opt for dairy-free ice cream to keep your creation authentic.)

Ingredients:

1 big scoop of ice cream

4 ounces of pineapple juice

2 cups of frozen pineapple

Directions:

Add pineapple, ice cream and juice to a blender. Start blending at low speed and increase to high speed. Blend until smooth. Make sure that lid is on tight! Use a piping bag with a star tip to create a classic swirl, or just scoop right into bowls.

Disney Parks' churro bites

Another Disney dessert option is the churro bites served throughout the parks. Here's how to make them at home, according to the Disney Parks Blog. The recipe serves four.

¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon, divided

1¼ cups all-purpose flour

1½ cups vegetable or canola oil

½ cup sugar

Directions:

Combine water, butter, salt and ¼ teaspoon cinnamon in 1½-quart saucepan over medium heat. Bring pot to rolling boil. Reduce heat to low. Add flour and stir vigorously until mix forms a ball. Remove from heat and let rest for 5-7 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, and stir until combined. Set aside. Heat oil in medium skillet or 1-quart saucepan over medium-high heat or until temperature reaches 350 degrees. Spoon dough into piping bag fitted with large star tip. Pipe 1-inch strip of dough over saucepan, cut with knife, and drop into hot oil. Repeat until churro bites fill saucepan with room to fry. Fry churro bites until golden brown. Remove with slotted spoon or mesh spider strainer. Drain churro bites on paper towel. Mix sugar and ½ teaspoon cinnamon in medium bowl. Toss in churro bites until coated. Place on serving plate and serve with favorite dipping sauce.

Toy Story Land's grilled cheese

½ cup shredded Double Gloucester or cheddar

2 tablespoons heavy cream

¼ teaspoon coarse salt

Equally spoon cream cheese spread on slices with provolone. Gently smooth cream cheese spread over each slice. Press cheddar side and provolone side together. Heat a large skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes, until hot. Brush both sides of the sandwiches with garlic spread. Grill sandwiches for 2 minutes on each side, until cheese is melted and bread is golden brown.

McDonald's McMuffin

The Disney Parks Blog isn't the only place people can find famous recipes. McDonald's UK, which has closed all its locations in the United Kingdom and Ireland, shared on Twitter how to make a sausage and egg McMuffin.

Want to make the meal creamier while staying true to the original? Use butter instead of liquid margarine. In 2015, the fast-food chain made a key ingredient switch, announcing that it would use butter instead of margarine across all its breakfast items. Before then, it had used margarine to toast biscuits and English muffins and to cook eggs.

DoubleTree chocolate chip cookies

DoubleTree, the hotel chain known for serving its guests warm cookies at check-in, understands customers might be craving them by this point. That's why the company has published its recipe for the first time.

Here's how to make 26 cookies.

Ingredients:

½ pound butter, softened (2 sticks)

¾ cup + 1 tablespoon granulated sugar

¾ cup packed light brown sugar

2 large eggs

1¼ teaspoons vanilla extract

¼ teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice

2¼ cups flour

½ cup rolled oats

1 teaspoon baking soda

1 teaspoon salt

Pinch of cinnamon

2⅔ cups Nestle Tollhouse semi-sweet chocolate chips

1¾ cups chopped walnuts

Directions:

Cream butter, sugar and brown sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer on medium speed for about 2 minutes. Add eggs, vanilla and lemon juice, blending with mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, then medium speed for about 2 minutes, or until light and fluffy, scraping down bowl. With mixer on low speed, add flour, oats, baking soda, salt and cinnamon, blending for about 45 seconds. Don’t overmix. Remove bowl from mixer and stir in chocolate chips and walnuts. Portion dough with a scoop (about 3 tablespoons) onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Space about 2 inches apart. Preheat oven to 300°F. Bake for 20 to 23 minutes, or until edges are golden brown and center is still soft. Remove from oven and cool on baking sheet for about 1 hour. Cook’s note: You can freeze the unbaked cookies, and there’s no need to thaw. Preheat oven to 300°F and place frozen cookies on parchment paper-lined baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Bake until edges are golden brown and center is still soft.

24/7 Wall Street

According to a study published in 2018 by the marketing blog Invesp about U.S. online grocery shopping statistics and trends, 48% of American food shoppers were already buying at least a portion of their groceries online, with that number expected to rise to 59% last year and to as much as 70% by 2022. The most important factors driving online food purchases were the fact that it saved time and was more convenient.

All this, remember, was before the coronavirus pandemic hit. It’s too early for comprehensive statistics on overall growth in the past few months, but according to data from the Nielsen and Rakuten Intelligence team, online sales of consumer packaged goods of the kinds typically sold in grocery stores increased 56% for the single week ending April 18 compared with the same period in 2019.

The limitations imposed by shelter-in-place orders, combined with concerns about in-person grocery shopping while the pandemic remains unchecked have obviously only increased demand for delivery. The major provider of grocery delivery, Instacart, for instance, saw its business more than double between this February and March. (Walmart and Amazon recorded higher delivery volume, but not exclusively of groceries.) The company delivers from many of the best grocery store chains in every state.

Shopping for our food and sundry household items has been a part of our lives for so long that it’s hard for some of us to imagine handing the chore over completely to somebody else, even if we’ve taken advantage of shopping services for some of our needs in the past. But that’s the new reality – and there are advantages to online shopping.

For one thing, in addition to saving time and eliminating the need for a trip to the market, online shopping often provides a wider selection of products.

In addition, it might actually save you money, even taking into consideration delivery fees and driver tips: Whether you realize it or not, you probably used to spend a portion of your weekly grocery budget on impulse buys. Supermarket layouts are designed to encourage unplanned purchases. If you're ordering groceries to be delivered, there's much less opportunity to pick up something you may or may not need on the spur of the moment.

1. Keep a running grocery list

Just because you're not going to the store yourself doesn't mean you shouldn't make a list. If you just go onto a store's site and start picking things out, you'll end up impulse-buying after all.

2. Do an inventory of what you have on hand

Before you place a grocery order, double-check your freezer and your pantry cupboards, and make sure you're not reordering things you've already got in sufficient quantity. (If you're ordering food that needs to be frozen, it's also important to make sure you'll have room in the freezer.)

3. Be specific

To help your surrogate shopper pick out exactly what you want, be as specific as possible. Don't just say ""a head of lettuce"" if you specifically want iceberg or romaine. And speaking of romaine, ""a bag of romaine"" could mean whole baby romaine leaves, chopped larger leaves, or one of those hearts-of-romaine bags holding three heads.

4. Attach a photo to your order

This won't be possible if you're using Instacart or some other online service or ordering directly from a grocery store. If an independent surrogate shopper is fulfilling your order, however, and you want a specific brand or flavor of some packaged food or some uncommon variety of produce, it's useful to attach an image of exactly what you want.

5. Consider substitutions

If there are no more blocks of Swiss cheese in the dairy case, will Jarlsberg do? If the chicken noodle soup is all gone, how about chicken and rice? Supermarket sites usually give you the option to accept substitutes if your exact order isn't available. If you're using an individual surrogate shopper, let him or her know whether or not alternatives are okay – and if so, what the parameters are (""any flavor except habanero"").

6. Don't order too little

If you regularly use items with long shelf lives – like certain brands of breakfast cereal, canned chili, peanut butter, or dried pasta – buy several at a time to cut down on the size of future orders.

7. Don't over-order

On the other hand, both to avoid wasting food that might go bad before you eat it and to show consideration for other shoppers, don't buy more that you'll be able to use within a reasonable period of time. Buying three boxes of Cheerios at a time is foresight; buying a dozen is hoarding.

8. Don't forget the toiletries and over-the-counter medications

Most supermarkets carry ample selections of personal grooming items, medicine-cabinet essentials (adhesive bandages, for instance), vitamins, and non-prescription medicines like antacids, pain relievers, and allergy pills. Including these in your grocery order will save you a trip to the drug store.

9. Plan ahead

Grocery delivery services, whether large-scale operations or independents, are facing huge demand right now, and might not always be able to fill orders in a timely manner. In some cases, you may have to book a delivery a week or more in advance, but at the very least expect to have to wait two or three days between submitting your order and receiving your groceries.

10. Tip generously

Even with safety measures in place, shopping for and delivering groceries can be a risky pursuit, and the people who are doing it are putting their own well-being on the line to perform a vital service. Be generous, showing your appreciation for them by tipping at least 10% of the grocery total (more if you can afford it), even if there's already a service charge.

11. Expect some disappointments

Even if you're specific about what you want and what substitutions you'll accept, sometimes there are omissions or mix-ups. They're rarely catastrophic. Unless they're really essential, in which case your shopper or shopping service should be able to correct the error, just add them to your next shopping list.

12. Clean or disinfect your groceries

While some experts say it isn't necessary to clean packaging or produce when you've unpacked it, it's safe to assume that anything that's been on the shelves or in the produce bins at the market has been touched by numerous people. To be especially safe, then, disinfect packages with antiseptic spray or wipes or soap and water. Don't use either directly on produce, though; just a thorough washing with warm water is enough.

Then the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the city and his son’s day care center but not Atkins’ job as an essential worker. After being reassigned to a midday shift that ends at 9 pm, he’s scrambled to find child care, leaning heavily on his mom and aunt.

Even clad in a jumpsuit, gloves and mask, his line of work carries health risks and he’s fearful of bringing home the deadly virus to the two-family flat he shares with his son, mother and younger sister. And, fiercely protective of his young charge, he wonders whether his son should return to day care when Michigan reopens.

“It’s overwhelming. I try not to focus on it,” Atkins says. “I just hope and pray for the best.”

When will schools reopen?:Not soon, education leaders say, despite Trump's declarations

The push to reboot the nation’s economy is leaving millions of parents like Atkins in a tough bind. They can’t go back to work without someone to care for their children, whether preschools or day care facilities, babysitters or relatives. And, even if they can find child care, they’re worried states are moving too quickly and may be putting their kids’ lives at risk.

Last week the Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected an extension of the state’s stay-at-home order. In some places, employees are being called back to work before child care facilities open.

Lack of child care is quickly emerging as one of the biggest barriers to the economy bouncing back, says Patricia Cole, senior director of federal policy for Zero to Three, a nonprofit focused on early childhood development.

“Child care is foundational to our nation’s ability to recover from this crisis,” Cole said during a news briefing put on by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

COVID-19 plunges child care system into crisis

COVID-19 has plunged the child care industry, 90% of which is privately run, into a crisis the likes of which the nation has never seen.

Already child care centers were expensive to operate and stayed afloat on meager profits. Caregivers and other staffers, a third of whom have been laid off, often get by on poverty wages and public assistance, unable to afford child care for their own children.

Now child care advocates argue the nation’s already fragile system is at risk of collapse. They are lobbying for billions more in federal aid to ensure reliable child care is available to parents.

Though in many places they were not required to close, since the pandemic began, nearly half of child care facilities nationwide have shut down, some of them indefinitely as the coronavirus forced families to keep kids at home, according to a survey of child care providers conducted by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC).

Seventeen percent of providers have closed to everyone except the children of essential personnel. Of the facilities which have remained open, 85% are operating at less than 50% of enrollment capacity and the majority of those are operating at less than 25% of capacity, the survey conducted in April found.

“We don't fully know yet who are the child care providers and facilities that are not going to have survived this economic crisis because they just couldn't keep the doors open,” says Javaid Siddiqi, CEO of The Hunt Institute, an education nonprofit in Cary, North Carolina.

It’s also unclear how many providers will be able to afford to reopen or at what capacity with strict new health protocols that vary from state to state. Some new rules limit the number of children that can be in any group – and in many cases require the same children and adults be placed together every day. Child care centers also face higher costs for additional staffing, personal protective equipment, hand sanitizer and cleaning supplies.

Summer camps and programs have also fallen on hard times and are being driven out of business. The ones still standing are trying to figure out if or how they can reopen safely.

Half of facilities closed, remaining providers stretched

Child care providers that have remained open to watch over the children of essential workers are stretched to the breaking point.

Crystal Perry-Grant, a 38-year-old mother of three, runs a family day care in Perris, California, a small city in Riverside County. For 12-hour stretches with the help of her 17-year-old daughter, she cares for eight children whose parents are essential workers from firefighters to UPS workers, ranging in age from 1 to 9.

School-age kids learn remotely on six computers that routinely slow her Wi-Fi to a crawl. She cooks homemade soups from fresh farm produce to boost their immune systems. Hand sanitizer squirted liberally throughout the day into little palms has kept sickness at bay. In the past two months, she hasn’t had even a single runny nose.

“Our parents need us. They don’t have family around. It’s a dire need. I would feel bad if I closed,” Perry-Grant says. “No one had a job they could up and quit, so I couldn’t either.”

But Perry-Grant can’t take on any more children. She has no openings and a long waiting list.

“This goes very much to the heart of whether we are going to be able to just reopen the economy,” says Michael Madowitz, an economist at the Center for American Progress who studies the child care industry. “There are a lot of reasons why we can't just flip a switch and this is very high on the list.”

For Demetriss “Demi” DeShazior, a 41-year-old medical assistant in Miami, child care tops her list of concerns.

Her mother babysat her 2-year-old while DeShazior languished on a long waiting list for partially subsidized child care. When she was seven months pregnant, DeShazior learned she’d secured a spot, but this was a month before the pandemic hit. Before she could finish filling out the paperwork, child care facilities closed.

So DeShazior took family medical leave earlier than she planned in March to stay home with her son. Now she's applying for child care for her toddler and 5-week-old as an essential health worker but her unease is growing.

“If I do return to work, will my babies be safe from contracting COVID-19 at day care?"" DeShazior wonders. “Will I even have day care covered for both babies by my return date?”

Nation cannot reopen with kids still at home

Even before the coronavirus tore across the country, parents scrambled to find child care. With too few spots to meet demand, the burden fell heaviest on low-wage parents, women and families of color. Now millions more spots may have evaporated.

Traditional backstops such as grandparents who used to step in to care for children while parents worked belong to populations most vulnerable to the coronavirus.

“Most states are talking about child care, but there’s a mixed bag in terms of how many are actually being planful about it. When you as a state say, ‘we’re open,’ but then you don’t give guidance around child care, that puts the burden of the situation on families,” says NAEYC's CEO Rhian Evans Allvin. And that, Allvin, says, “exacerbates the already existing inequities in early childhood education because inherently wealthier families have more options.”

As more parents prepare to return to work, the enormousness of the challenge facing the nation’s patchwork child care system is staggering.

Four in 10 working adults have children under 18. Nearly 60% of children under 5 participated in regular weekly care arrangements and a third were enrolled in a child care program of some kind before the coronavirus struck. Yet, with many child care providers from small family day cares to after-school programs closing up shop indefinitely, parents are at loose ends.

“Parents who are being called back into work at this point really may find challenges in securing care or even, in some cases, securing the care they were accustomed to,” says Dan Wuori, director of early learning at The Hunt Institute, which has a database tracking state child care policies.

Among those parents is Laura Byrd, 35, a human resources generalist from Newark, New Jersey and mother of a 7-year-old who’s been working from home since the start of the pandemic.

“Our ‘new normal’ will pose some difficulties once I am instructed to return to the office. As the state reopens, our day care centers and summer camps will not be operating which will create child care issues for me,” says Byrd, who’s considering taking a leave of absence if necessary.

Agonizing choices between health risks and paychecks

Reopening is forcing parents in Georgia, Florida and other states into an agonizing choice between potentially risking their health and the health of their children and earning a paycheck.

Late at night and in the early morning hours, Christy Moreno, 39, a bilingual editorial director, squeezes a stress ball while sending work emails from her Kansas City, Missouri, home.

Her makeshift office is a small round table in the corner of her dining room covered in stray crayons and device chargers. This single mother of two, ages 10 and 13, balances overseeing her children’s education and counseling Latino parents working in hotels and restaurants on how to find child care. On social media, parent groups are overflowing with worry and confusion: What are families supposed to do?

Anxieties are running especially high for parents whose children have health conditions that put them at higher risk for the coronavirus. Many can’t afford lower-risk options such as babysitters and nannies or having one parent stay home. These parents say even if they can find child care, they don’t know if they should send their kids. Some employees can take sick leave or expanded family and medical leave if they are caring for a child when schools and day care centers are closed under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which was signed into law in March, but not everyone has that option.

“Parents are being forced into this Catch-22,” says Keri Rodrigues, founding president of the National Parents Union, a network of parent organizations across the country. “They feel a desperate need to go back to work but at the same time they are terrified of this deadly virus.”

Parents worry: Is it safe to send kids back to child care?

Laid off in March, Rachel Jean-Pierre is a single mother of two in Union, New Jersey. If she’s called back to her job in New York City as a guest service manager in July, she will have to find a family member to help care for her children, ages 6 and 9, both of whom have asthma.

“With the government reopening the economy with no confirmed solution to this pandemic, I am torn between wanting my children to return to their normal schedules and wanting to keep them safe,” she says. “Until the country has really grabbed hold of this pandemic, as a parent with children who suffer from asthma, I would rather be safe than sorry.”

Conflicting messages have not helped parents make these tough calls. While President Donald Trump pushes governors to work to reopen schools, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned in Senate testimony last week, ""We don't know everything about this virus and we really better be pretty careful, particularly when it comes to children.""

It’s week 11 of quarantine for Naomi Nedd, a 49-year-old mother and contract negotiator for a managed care plan in Queens. She’s resorted to bribing her 3-year-old son with gummy bears and screen time when she has to write a contract or jump on a Zoom call. Once he falls asleep at 7:30 pm, she digs in for hours to make a dent in her workload.

“I went into this thinking, my kid is home, it will be fine. But it’s so different when you are trying to be the professional you are when you’ve left your child at day care than when you are at a dining room table with a 3-year-old who just knows you’re mommy,” Nedd says.

Her son is supposed to start a summer program in July and preschool in the fall, but her heart races just thinking about it. The ravages of the coronavirus are all around her at the epicenter of the New York outbreak. Children her son’s age don’t know how to socially distance.

“I don't care what opens up, if my gut feels like it isn’t safe, we will have to figure out a way to continue to make it work at home,” Nedd says.

In Boston, Yahaira Lopez, a 41-year-old mother of 10-year-old twins, one with ADHD, the other with autism, was recently laid off from her job on a mobile crisis team performing mental health risk assessments. She’s struggling to be a substitute teacher to her two fourth graders, run Autism Sprinter, her nonprofit that helps the families and caregivers of children who are on the spectrum, and figure out how she’ll afford rent and utilities.

Schools are closed, summer programs are up in the air and Massachusetts has not yet reopened child care centers, she says. Even when these programs restart, Lopez says she’s not sure she will send her kids. Both of her sons have severe asthma.

“I would probably be very scared to send my children to any form of child care or after school program,” she says, “or, to be honest with you, even back to school into what may be overcrowded classrooms.”",100,High,Center,USA,1

USA TODAY NETWORK today launched a series about America’s food chain to tell the stories of the people who are working to keep America fed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Through a series of intimate portraits, Gannett journalists will shine a light on the lives and work of the people who pick the oranges, slaughter the pigs, truck the goods and cook the food, so our nation can continue to eat amid the coronavirus outbreak.

The first story published in the series is about a worker at a large meat processing plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota – the state’s largest city with a population of 180,000 where Gannett’s Argus Leader newsroom is located. The in-depth piece spotlights John Deranamie, who came to the United States from Liberia during the civil war, has worked at the Smithfield plant in Sioux Falls for over eight years and contracted COVID-19 as part of his job.

Over 40 Gannett journalists from more than 10 newsrooms across the country are contributing to this series led by USA TODAY consumer editor Michelle Maltais and Des Moines Register politics editor Rachel Stassen-Berger. New stories in the series will continue to roll out over the coming weeks.

“Food workers have faced great risks to keep America fed, and we wanted to focus a spotlight on some of the people in the food chain,’’ said Jeff Taylor, USA TODAY’s executive editor for news. “The collaboration for this series represents the strength and reach of our national news network.’’",100,High,Center,USA,1

Akron Beacon Journal

JC Tretter isn’t willing to publicly quantify his level of optimism that an NFL season will be held in 2020.

The starting center of the Browns and new president of the NFL Players Association said the COVID-19 pandemic has created too many unknowns to speculate about what football will look like as the year unfolds.

“This is a contact disease, and we play a contact sport,” Tretter said Tuesday during a Zoom video conference with Browns beat writers.

“You can’t expect just to throw football back in and think that the virus is going to kneel down to almighty football. You have to look through different ways of making sure people stay healthy.”

Some NFL teams began reopening their facilities Tuesday, but players and coaches still aren’t permitted at club headquarters, all of which had been shut down since late March.

Meanwhile, Browns staffers continue to work remotely while the organization works through finalizing its reopening plans.

The NFL’s voluntary virtual offseason program is scheduled to run through May 29, but the league has already extended it once and could do so again.

The Browns are slated to begin training camp in late July, kick off the preseason August 15 and start the regular season Sept. 13.

In a memo NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell sent to the 32 teams last week, he wrote the league is working with the NFLPA “on developing protocols that could permit a certain number of players to return to club facilities as early as next month.”

However, Tretter explained “there’s a long list of hurdles” that need to be cleared before players will be comfortable returning to work in the traditional sense, let alone playing in games.

“There’s a level of risk of everything,” Tretter said. “You’re facing a level of risk right now going to the grocery store. There’s always going to be a level of exposure that people are going to face in this. So I don’t think we’ll ever get to a point where there’s no risk of exposure.

“Coming in contact with other people is a risk of exposure. So that’s never going to be down to zero. Our job [at the NFLPA] is to try to get that to as close to zero as possible, and that’s why you kind of have to look at everything.”

Tretter said “obviously testing is going to have to be real important” for the league to charge ahead with a season. But Tretter also repeatedly stressed the importance of being open to new ideas.

NFLPA medical director Thom Mayer told ESPN’s Adam Schefter this week on Schefter’s podcast that the league is partnering with Oakley to explore the possibility of designing face masks with surgical or N95 material.

“I think there’s no bad idea at this point, and you kind of have to think outside the box,” Tretter said when asked about the innovative face mask concept. “And just ’cause it’s an idea doesn’t mean things are definitely going to happen, but you need to explore it, and you need to understand it.”

Tretter, who earned a degree in industrial and labor relations from Cornell University, said he decided to run for NFLPA president right after this past season ended. He was elected in March shortly before the players approved a new collective bargaining agreement in a close vote.

Since the global health crisis has changed everyday life, Tretter has been involved with biweekly conference calls the union has held for players and their wives to address COVID-19 concerns.

“Our priority is always going to be the health and safety of the players, and usually when you say that, you mean things that happen on the field,” Tretter said. “Obviously, it kind of takes a new meaning with everything going on now.

“The emphasis is always on the elderly population and the effects of the virus, but there are a lot of people with underlying conditions inside our league. People see professional athletes as kind of these invincible robots where they’re just kind of always in the best shape and there’s no chink in the armor, but that’s not really the case.”

Tretter said he thinks the league and NFLPA reaching an agreement about returning to the field is “still a ways out.” But he also pointed out the two sides have time on their side.

Meanwhile, he’s not putting “a percentage” or “a level” on how likely playing football in the fall will be.

“There’s really no reason to live in a lot of different hypotheticals, or else I feel like you kind of get paralyzed in those hypotheticals, keep going down different rabbit holes and you kind of just lose track of the now,” Tretter said. “So I’ve been trying to live in two-week increments.”",100,High,Center,USA,1

The Tuscaloosa News

Work on the ongoing Bryant-Denny Stadium construction project at the University of Alabama was briefly suspended last weekend after an undisclosed number of workers had positive tests for the coronavirus. Work resumed Monday, according to the project’s chief contractor, the Montgomery-based Caddell Construction Company.

""The safety of all of our employees and trade partners is our top priority,"" Caddell said in a statement to The Tuscaloosa News on Tuesday night. ""In addition to adhering to all established protocols to protect our workers, Caddell restricted operations over the past weekend after receiving notice of positive tests among some employees and trade partners. This allowed us to engage in additional deep-cleaning and provide testing by an independent laboratory so all of our team members could be cleared before returning to the job site.

""Our processes meet and/or exceed OSHA and CDC guidelines. We will continue to act on the latest guidance and information to promote the health and safety of our essential workforce.""

The statement did not specify the number of cases at the site.

The school also issued a statement to The News indicating it had ""provided sanitation supplies ... and personal protection equipment"" to all contractors.

""From the start of the pandemic, UA has continuously mandated that our campus contractors take all necessary steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19,"" said the statement from the university's Office of Strategic Communications. ""The contractors immediately adapted operations and processes, engaged in heightened cleaning and took other protective measures for the health and safety of their employees. The University directly provided sanitation supplies, thermometers and signage at all construction sites, and made personal protective equipment available to all contractors. Those processes, which have been in place since early March, are continuously refined based on the latest guidance from state, federal and industry leaders in order to protect the health and safety of the campus community.”

Work on the $92.5 million first phase of renovation began in November. Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne said in a video Q&A last week that construction was ""on schedule"" despite a January accident in which two workers were injured by falling beams.

TAMPA, Fla. – Tom Brady isn’t letting the coronavirus pandemic – or NFL rules against players working out at team facilities – keep him from preparing for a new season with his new Tampa Bay team.

Brady gathered some of his new Buccaneers teammates on a high school field early Tuesday for a throwing session. Brady wore a Buccaneers helmet and an orange jersey over his shoulder pads. The informal, players-only workout at Berkeley Preparatory School lasted two hours, according to The Tampa Bay Times.

It’s not unusual for quarterbacks to organize passing workouts before training camp, but the pandemic has changed normal routines. Teams have had to rely on virtual meetings instead of traditional offseason programs as the NFL tries to make plans for a 2020 season, possibly without fans.

Because of the pandemic which has forced social distancing and sheltering at home as the new rules, any gathering of players is notable – especially one involving Brady, a six-time Super Bowl champion with the New England Patriots. Brady, 42, signed a two-year, $50 million contract with the Bucs in March.

After signing with the Bucs, Brady asked for phone numbers of his teammates. He apparently made use of that list to organize Tuesday’s workout.

It was an encouraging sign for fans on the same day NFL teams began opening facilities to a limited number of personnel. The facilities are still off-limits for coaches and players, except for players undergoing injury rehabilitation.

Center Ryan Jensen practiced shotgun snaps to Brady on the artificial turf football field.

Though he’s the newcomer, Brady was in charge, according to the paper. Brady walked through a route with receiver Mike Evans, demonstrating for the veteran and other players exactly where to make their cuts.

Quarterbacks Blaine Gabbert and Ryan Griffin also threw passes.

Among other players attending the session were receiver Scotty Miller, tight ends Cameron Brate and O.J. Howard and running back Dare Ogunbowale.

Teams cannot organize such workouts, and the Buccaneers did not publicize Tuesday’s session.

There was no immediate reply from the team to a request from The Associated Press for comment on the workout.

Tuesday’s workout went better than Brady’s attempt to work out privately at a Tampa park last month. After he was told by a security guard that the park was closed and he had to leave, Brady received an apology from mayor Jane Castor.",100,High,Center,USA,1

No sunflower seeds?

“I think it’s a great protocol with everyone getting tested every day,’’ DeJong told USA TODAY Sports. “But once we get past that, and into the season, I think things should get back to normal. I just feel like if we pass the exam and the daily testing, we should act freely in the clubhouse and on the field, and have fun.

“You can’t change having guys holding runners on first base. How about the catcher and the umpire and the batter all together at the plate? You can’t high-five?

“And I can’t even think about no sunflower seeds. That’s such a minimal risk.’’

This will be baseball in 2020, although it may feel more like a boot camp. Players are being advised to shower only at home or in their hotel rooms. No more buffets at the ballpark. No restaurants or bars on the road. No use of swimming pools or saunas. And don’t you dare let a soul into your hotel room outside immediate family members.

“I know we need testing protocols and assurances we’re OK,’’ DeJong says, “but I don’t know how sustainable all these ideas are. Some of these things are crazy, and are hard to enforce.

“This could be an infrastructure nightmare. It’s not going to be perfect right away, but guys have to ride with it.’’

READY TO GO:How 'insane' lifestyle has ignited Casey Mize's rise through baseball, soon to Tigers

MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association are scheduled to resume negotiations this week, with perhaps the biggest hurdle being economic as owners ask the players to assume part of the financial risk of playing with no fans. There is hard deadline for negotiations to conclude, but the hope still is that at least 82 regular-season games can be played beginning by the July 4th weekend with a record 14 teams qualifying for the postseason in October.

“I want to play, we all want to play,’’ DeJong says, “and I’m pretty optimistic now this is going to happen. With all this going on, we won’t take any unnecessary risk, but we’d all rather be out there than sitting home and sulking.

“We’ll be fine once we agree to a reasonable plan.’’

Still, no matter how many protocols, there will always be risk playing during the coronavirus pandemic. MLB to keep clubhouses, dugouts and other areas at ballparks disinfected as much as possible, but renowned chemist Lawrence Rocks, whose son is DeJong's agent, Burton Rocks, cautions that even cleaning solutions could be hazardous.

“The vapors from the ammonia and chlorine compounds, which are used in industrial cleaning, if used excessively, as with any overdose, can cause cilia damage in mucus membranes,’’ Rocks told USA TODAY Sports, ""and can actually have the effect of making a person more susceptible to virus or bacterial infection. These chemicals, which are often used in a deep clean of a building, can cause loss of oxygen transport in deep lung tissue, which takes the edge off a player considerably.

“Thus, any cleaning of any ballpark locker room, or any hotel room where a player lives, which is necessary given the transmissibility of COVID-19, needs to be done under OSHA standards, and with full knowledge that an elite athlete so as not to over-use the cleaners.”

DeJong, 26, a biochemistry and pre-science major at Illinois State who graduated with a 3.74 GPA, understands the health risks more than most of his peers. His own agent is a high-risk candidate, surviving three code blues as an infant with asthma.

Rocks said when fans are permitted to attend games, teams should forget about bobblehead day and instead have “Activated Carbon Mask’’ giveaways. And in the meantime, clubs should send the masks to season-ticket holders as a goodwill gesture, Burton Rocks and DeJong said.

“Right now, we have to protect our kids,’’ Burton Rocks said. “I think it’s a great opportunity for teams to jump on this. Who knows, a little kid may be inspired to invent the next vaccine?’’

DeJong, whose 74 homers in his first three seasons trail only future Hall of Famer Albert Pujols in Cardinals history, is fascinated how this season will play out. It’ll be a season like no other. Forget the age-old mantra; it’s now a sprint and not a marathon.

Losing streaks may blow up a season. Slumps will feel endless. The separator in this truncated season, DeJong said, may be the mental edge.

“I want to be ready because it’s going to be an adjustment,’’ DeJong said. “This shortened season will really test ourselves with all of the anxiety. You can’t look at it like, 'Oh, we just lost four in a row, and now we’re 3½ games back.’ You start thinking about those things, and it brings on an intense state. You have to be fearless, and trust yourself, staying in the moment as much as you can.’’

DeJong already started devising ways to rejuvenate his body and mind. He has been practicing cymatics, the study of sound and vibration. He meditates in the mornings and listening to soothing music while his mattress and pillow vibrate, the pain and stress washed away by sound. He calls it a mental reset.

He is religiously watching the Food Network, particularly proud of his steak au poivre. And he has immersed himself into books, and no, not one is about sports, let alone having anything to do with baseball.

He said he is reading five books these days, hoping to finish all by the resumption of spring training in June.

Let’s see, there’s “Sacred Geometry and Architecture’’ by Arturo Ponce de Leon, “Magnet Therapy Theory and Practice’’ by Bengali C. Neville, “An Esoteric Cosmology,’’ by Rudolf Steiner, “The wellspring of Good’’ by Beinsa Douno and “Holographic Blood’’ by Harvey Bigelsen.

Yeah, just your typical assortment of reading material by one of the game’s youngest stars.

“I like to read all kinds of random stuff,’’ DeJong says. “I’m really interested in magnets now, how we have our magnetic fields as humans. There can be imbalances in our own magnetic fields, and that can be rectified in therapy, using magnets to balance yourself.

“I’m a very big picture person, and I’m just trying to get all of these disciplines and bringing them together.’’

The reward is a World Series championship, and even if this season tramples all tradition, playing 82 games with no fans in the stands, no high-fives, no Gatorade bath, no sunflower seeds, this season may be forever cherished in baseball history.

“The asterisk may live in the mind of the fan, but none of us will consider it like that,’’ DeJong says. “We’re all competing on the same field under the same rules.

“I think with all of the sacrifices everyone will be making will make it that much more personal. The games could get more intense. The season will mean so much to so many people.

With the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's no-sail order set to expire in late July, cruise lines are starting to consult design experts to ensure passenger safety and minimize risk of infection from coronavirus and other viral outbreaks in the future.

""Nothing will be more critical to resuming sustained and profitable long term operations than making cruising the safest option in (the) travel and leisure space and providing cruisers with peace of mind,"" Frank Del Rio, CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., said on an earnings call Thursday.

Cleaning a floating petri dish: How is a cruise ship sanitized after a coronavirus outbreak?

""Ships are currently formulating similar plans to address outbreaks of COVID-19, and these plans could also be modified to prevent and respond to other communicable illnesses in the future,"" Aimee Treffiletti, chief of the CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program, told USA TODAY last month.

Most cruise lines haven't revealed concrete plans yet but suggested changes may include revamping dining rooms and other highly trafficked areas to promote social distancing.

However, AMK Architecture & Design, a Greek firm that specializes in hotel and cruise ship interiors and has worked on more than 120 marine-based projects for lines such as Celebrity and Costa, is already working on future strategies.

""The core of the hospitality business – no matter where it is, is essentially the same, and that is to provide guests with the ultimate experience during their stay,"" Anna Koustsoukosta, AMK's principal architect and managing partner, told USA TODAY. ""The cruise industry, however, which is a floating hotel, is a much more difficult and complex application.""

Now another degree of difficulty has been added to the challenge of designing a cruise ship: How do you stop the spread of COVID-19 or other highly contagious viruses in the future? And how do you continue to offer passengers the convenience of a large cruise ship while prioritizing safety?

""Necessity is the mother of invention, and in this period, we need to reinvent how the passenger moves in the ship and interacts with the ship,"" said Koustsoukosta.

Why are cruise ships so high-risk?

Cruise ships squeeze hundreds or thousands of guests into a relatively small space, and megaships play a prominent role in the industry. Royal Caribbean's 1,188-foot Symphony of the Seas, for instance, can accommodate nearly 9,000 passengers and crew.

""Like other close-contact environments, ships may facilitate the transmission of respiratory viruses from person to person through exposure to respiratory droplets or contact with contaminated surfaces,"" Treffiletti said.

Cruises, which have a the-more-the-merrier philosophy, are never a solitary affair. The fun centers around myriad group activities in a nonstop party atmosphere. Sipping cocktails around the pool, filling showrooms for Las Vegas-style revues, dancing, playing games or lining up at the buffet table all offer viruses opportunities to spread.

'Inherently high-risk setting': Are cruise ships unsafe – and will they change?

But ships are facing a potential new reality in which cruise lines' business model will change: The number of passengers could be restricted – either by the CDC or cruise lines – to ensure physical distancing. If that change happens, the lines will need to look at new ways to generate revenue in addition to creating an environment in which they are ready for onboard emergencies such as a viral outbreak.

What kind of changes are needed?

""The aim is to suggest solutions to reduce the need for touch interaction, make surfaces and frequently-touched points virus resistant and shape the layout of areas of the ship so as to enable safe and at-distant flow of passengers and crew, without sacrificing socializing, which is one of the important ingredients of the cruise,"" said Koustsoukosta.

Dustin Schafer, director of engineers and senior vice president at Henderson Engineering, who is working on strategies to stop viruses in buildings, said similar ideas would apply to cruise ships, where space is at a premium and social distancing is harder.

“Air and surface cleaning becomes even more critical,"" he told USA TODAY. ""As a first-line strategy, I would recommend retrofits to remove required touch points throughout the ships.""

Embarkation and disembarkation areas

The first crowded public area most cruisers encounter is the embarkation area, where passengers check in and present travel documents before boarding their ship. AMK suggests making the following changes to make these areas less of a petri dish:

A ""sanitization gate"" at the embarkation/disembarkation area of the ship to ensure hygiene protocols are followed

Technology to limit or rid cruise ships of check-in lines

Anti-microbial carpets for public areas and cabin corridors

Automatic doors for entrance and exit points to avoid unnecessary touching

Passenger cabins

Koustsoukosta expects that luxury cabins and suites will become first preference for passengers since those rooms provide access to fresh air.

Diamond Princess:A visual guide to the ship that gave rise to 712 COVID-19 cases

Koustsoukosta suggests creating an enclosed space akin to a mudroom just outside the cabin where passengers could place clothing and shoes worn prior to entering their cabin. Crew could also leave food and linens in the event of a quarantine.

Inside the cabin itself, antimicrobial carpets and fabric could be installed and bathrooms could be modified for touch-free operation; shower curtains could be replaced with glass dividers.

Crew cabins

Koutsoukosta and her team haven't forgotten the crew members, who remain on board after passengers have disembarked. And due to the pandemic and complicated rules for repatriating workers to their home countries, there are still employees marooned on ships today waiting to be let off.

""With the well-being and safety of the crew in mind, cabins for the crew members can change in capacity or size so as to allow adequate self-distancing for the living quarters,"" Koutsoukosta said.

""In the cruise industry the number of passengers is closely tied to the number of crew members,"" said Koutsoukosta. ""Now, with the assumption that ships will be sailing with a reduced number of passengers, this will mean that the number of service personnel will be also reduced, as they will have to cater for less people.""

Because of that potential reduction, she imagines that crew cabins that hosted four individuals could be repurposed for two individuals and some cabins could be left unoccupied to be used in case of an emergency.

Like prisoners': Crews are still marooned aboard cruise ships mired in red tape

Dining areas

Dining on ships will likely change, as well. Koutsoukosta said that table sizing and spacing could be altered to ensure safe distancing between passengers and still provide enough room for staff to move about. Dividers could even be used to create separation at times if needed, she added.

The style of dining on board could change, too, including the popular buffet option. Some cruise line officials say that buffets could disappear entirely.

Frank Del Rio, CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, told USA TODAY in an interview that the buffet – a cruise ship mainstay – would probably not be offered anymore.

But Koutsoukosta doesn't necessarily believe buffets need to be eliminated entirely.

""The buffets layout can also change, with more counters as a solution to avoid long queues or even offering table service,"" she said.

Royal Caribbean president and CEO Michael Bayley indicated he thinks buffets can adapt, too.

""We’ve got teams working on every single element of the guest experience and we obviously have a team working on the buffet,"" he said during a Royal Caribbean ""coffee chat"" reported on by CruiseRadio.net.

Theaters

AMK told Cruise Industry News that theaters could be moved outdoors, to start.

""New open-air show theaters and disco areas, with weather-protection options, can give passengers indoor comfort and outdoor relaxation and security,"" Koutsoukosta explained to USA TODAY.

Schafer, the engineer, suggested that cruise lines ""utilize portable UVc lights or potentially fogging systems to sanitize high-occupancy spaces such as dining and entertainment areas."" (Electrostatic sprayers have also been used to disinfect the Diamond Princess and commercial airline cabins.)

Ask the Captain:What are airlines doing to sanitize planes and airports?

Swimming pools

While pools themselves will remain intact, surrounding areas can be reimagined, according to Koutsoukosta.

""To better understand how we can improve the surrounding areas, we must observe how the pools are used and for what function,"" she said.

In that vein, many passengers use the pool areas to tan and go into the pool only to cool themselves, she explained. An updated pool area design could include showers and other water features to provide alternatives and mitigate pool crowding.

""In addition to that, there are thoughts for passengers to book their slots in the pools, which will give them the added comfort of spaciousness,"" she said.

And cabanas could replace sun beds or deck chairs to promote social distancing on pool decks.

She also mentioned that they are evaluating the use of hot tubs.

Medical facilities

Onboard medical facilities also need to be upgraded as ships prepare to relaunch after coronavirus. In fact, Koutsoukosta said she believes they could become a ""differentiator"" as cruise lines compete to woo back customers.

It's likely, she said, that there will be increased space for medical facilities and cabins for medical crew that are separate from the rest of the crew.

""All medical-related facilities can be interlinked, and (at) the same time, isolated from the rest of the ship so as to separate medical operations from the public areas of the ship,"" Koutsoukosta said.

By having medical facilities separated from the rest of the ship, security and safety for doctors, nurses and patients alike would be increased, she explained. All health emergencies could be dealt with securely in one part of the ship while the fun could remain in tact on the rest of the ship.

How soon could these changes be implemented?

Koutsoukosta couldn't provide a timeline for when these safety upgrades might start appearing on cruise ships. She said AMK is currently consulting with one client and in talks with another, neither of which the company is able to identify.

""Anytime from a few weeks to a few months based on the extent to which of the vessels will be modified,"" she estimated. ""Again, after the feasibility studies, it’s a matter of decision by the cruise lines. Everybody right now is more or less testing the waters.""

Del Rio echoed Koutsoukosta's sentiment, predicting that the relaunching cruise ships, including Norwegian's own fleet of 28 ships, will involve trial and error.

""There will be fits and starts, and it will require the implementation of new protocols as we learn what works,"" he said.

Could changes be applied to ships already in service or only new vessels?

Koutsoukosta said it will be easier to implement complex changes to ships that are still on the drawing board or in preliminary stages of construction.

It's a little trickier to alter existing ships.

""There is really a certain limitation to the extent to which one can modify them quickly and in an economically viable way,"" she explained. ""What we try to do with our clients is focus on the vital-few solutions.""

Competition in the cruise industry has always been intense, Koutsoukosta added, and it will remain that way after coronavirus. And while sanitation upgrades aren't as grabby as onboard roller coasters or private islands, they will be necessary to compete.

""The changes that the cruise lines will make to their ships does not only improve their product offering, but it also puts them ahead of their competitors, as physical distancing, and hygiene is the new luxury,"" she said.

CruiseCritic.com

With the coronavirus pandemic shutting down the cruise industry for several months, Caribbean islands have been left in limbo, facing hard choices on what comes next, when and if cruise ships return.

Most islands in the Caribbean are highly dependent on tourism, with cruise ships and the related services that they provide responsible for a large percentage of jobs for residents. While the mid-March shutdown came after the Caribbean's high season, a full summer without the regular work that cruise ships bring in could have lasting economic consequences.

At the same time, most islands have limited health care facilities; an influx of coronavirus cases from tourists, both on land or sea, could prove devastating to residents. Discussions on the islands are centering on that paradox: how to bring back the tourists who fuel the economy without endangering the people who live there.

CruiseCritic.com is checking in with major ports in the Caribbean to see how the conversations are going. Here's what the cruise website is hearing.

U.S. Virgin Islands

Home to St. Thomas, one of the Caribbean's busiest cruise ports, the U.S.V.I. have been under the same health restrictions and warnings as parts of the United States and have been following regulations set out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Tourists will be permitted to return to the islands June 1, but cruise ships won't come back until much later, as the lines work out their agreements with the CDC, Joseph Boschulte, Commissioner of Tourism for the territory, told Cruise Critic in an interview.

The mid-March timing of the cruise line shutdown came after most of the islands' high season, which runs from November through the end of March/early April, had already occurred, Boschulte said. Still, the revenues stopped from mid-March on, leaving the island without the crucial spring break income and run up to the Easter holidays, he said.

""We have gone from a trajectory of having a little over 1.5 million cruise customers in the territory for this fiscal year … and then we went to zero,"" Boschulte said. Summer traditionally has been a softer season for the Caribbean, but St. Thomas still averages between 100,000 to 115,000 cruise visitors in May and June; those two months alone represent a loss of nearly $36 million.

The Virgin Islands government and tourism interests have been talking regularly to the cruise lines about their plans to return, both individually and through the Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association. Discussions center around how lines not only can ensure that passengers stay safe from COVID-19 during port stops, but also how the island can protect its residents from getting ill, Boschulte said.

Testing for the virus has become a cornerstone in requirements for lines returning, but questions remain as to who does it – and when – the minister said. ""What do we do after they come back from touring or on the beach – do we test them before they go back on board or does the ship?""

Any excursion that takes place in St. Thomas will have to follow local health and safety protocols, Boschulte said. ""Even when the bars and restaurants open, the expectation is that you will wear a mask,"" he said. Shore excursion operators and even the popular ferry to St. John could also require masks. ""The next layer of questions become, 'Do (passengers) have to bring their own, or will the shore excursion company provide it?""

Boschulte also notes the island will need time to prepare safely, to make sure that residents who interact with tourists have the equipment they need, such as masks and hand sanitizer. ""That's taxi people, that's people who work the security at the gates, that's people who work the beaches, the restaurants and the bars.""

Another big unknown that will affect St. Thomas: What will capacity be on the first ships that arrive? St. Thomas is a port for some of the industry's largest ships, such as Royal Caribbean's Symphony of the Seas, which carries up to 6,000 passengers. ""Now if they only sail at 50% capacity, that's a much different model for us a port to manage,"" Boschulte said.

""Until we get a vaccine, I think we are going to have to err on the side of most caution,"" he said. ""What I can tell you is that we're cautiously optimistic that over the next few months, we will get closer to having adequate testing and a very thorough protocol safety set of initiatives for the cruise industry that we, as travelers, can have confidence in what's being put in place, and also that the residents of a highly traveled cruise ship destination feel comfortable that guests coming back in doesn't jeopardize the quality of their health.""

Puerto Rico

A home port for Southern Caribbean cruises, Puerto Rico was expecting 108 cruise ships in San Juan between May and September 2020. While the island is still evaluating the exact loss in revenue, the impact is being felt by a diverse group of businesses, including retail shops, tour operators, transportation businesses, harbor bunkering services and local suppliers.

The process of safely welcoming visitors again has been a top concern; the island has 80,000 people employed in tourism, which makes up 6.5% of Puerto Rico's GDP, Brad Dean, CEO of Discover Puerto Rico, told Cruise Critic.

He noted that the island was the first U.S. destination to implement measures such as an island-wide curfew and thermographic cameras to take temperatures of travelers coming into Puerto Rico at the San Juan airport. Other measures include implementation of intensive screening, enhanced sanitation, quarantine zones, on-site medical personnel and additional disinfection of local facilities.

Expect to see buffets, salad bars and self-service restaurants eliminated in tourism businesses, Dean said. Reusable menus will not be available. Lodging for pre- and post-cruise stays will have island-specific certification cards, and guests will receive a health and safety guide from each property.

Puerto Rico is well poised as a destination that can return in the post-COVID-19 world, Dean said, pointing out the island's abundant outdoor attractions and beaches.

""The Puerto Rican community has hospitality in its DNA and will undoubtedly welcome visitors back with open arms and the warmth that it did following past adversity,"" he said.

St. Kitts

With fantastic beaches as well as UNESCO historical sites, St. Kitts has become an important and popular stop on Caribbean cruise itineraries, on both Eastern and Southern routes.

The island was projected to receive 45 cruise calls between May and September 2020, with 166,936 projected passengers. The loss of that income, based on cruise passenger spend alone, is more than $18 million, according to Racquel Brown, CEO of the St. Kitts Tourism Authority.

""We began to see an impact as early as February and March to our cruise sector, which makes up a significant portion of our tourism industry as a whole and contributes approximately $136 million in passenger spend alone to our economy per year,"" she told Cruise Critic. ""Add to that about another $7 million including passenger fees, fuel charges, taxes, navigation services and so on, so the scope of the economic impact becomes very clear.""

Cruising has helped St. Kitts grow a bustling summer tourism season, with at least two ships a week. ""There are many of our nationals who depend on the cruise industry, and the impact has been felt greatly. It has affected our vendors, who depend on the industry for their daily living, our beach vendors, our water sports operators, our taxi and tour bus operators and our hotels. Business owners have had to reduce staff hours or lay off staff. This has been difficult, as they have grown over the years from St. Kitts' vibrant cruise industry and at present there is no demand to sustain the amount of business they have grown accustomed to transacting.""

The island country, which includes sister Nevis – a port for small and luxury cruise ships – has been working with the FCCA and other Caribbean countries for a ""careful and phased"" reopening plan, she said.

""The ability to meet the established CDC guidelines will be our first step to the cruise sector resuming business,"" Brown said. ""As a destination, we will adhere to CDC guidelines and protocols for the cruise industry as well as the guidelines provided by our Ministry of Health,"" which follows World Health Organization protocol.

""Of course, we know that social distancing protocols will have to be observed, the use of hand sanitizers, the washing of hands and the use of personal protective equipment in order to ensure the safety of our guests and our citizens and residents.""

What makes the COVID-19 crisis different from the hurricanes that often disrupt Caribbean tourism is the sheer scope, she said. With hurricanes, governments have emergency plans in place, and tourists often visit as soon as they can to help support the destination, which gives the country some level of control.

""The entire cruise industry is closed, the borders are closed. We have never had a no-sail order that has restricted the entire cruise sector,"" she said.

While some islands might take the pause to consider issues of overtourism, Brown said that St. Kitts built cruising gradually and sees its growth as controlled. ""The people of St. Kitts enjoy and appreciate the cruise industry and look forward to the time when we can safely welcome visitors to our shores again.""

MGM Resorts, operator of a dozen properties in this gambling and entertainment capital, announced Monday the return of the treasured amenity, reports the Reno Gazette Journal, which is a part of the USA TODAY Network.

“MGM Resorts is updating many of our offerings as we prepare to welcome guests back, and that includes implementing free parking,"" the company said in a statement.

A start date has not been disclosed. In the wake of COVID-19, MGM won't open all hotels at once, but rather start with two or three targeted at different traveler budgets.

The first two resorts that will reopen with free parking when shutdown orders are lifted? New York-New York Hotel & Casino, a midprice hotel on the south end of the Strip with a roller coaster, arcade and Irish pub, and Bellagio, the luxury mid-Strip resort that's home to the famous fountain show, high-end shops and restaurants, a conservatory and a museum.

Parking strategy swing

In 2016, a majority of casino companies started charging tourists to keep their cars in the parking garages of Strip properties, a move that raised concerns that free parking would soon fade away.

In 2019, after experimenting with a paid parking model, Wynn Resorts broke ranks with the bulk of hotel-casinos on the Strip and announced free self-parking would resume at its Wynn and Encore resorts.

MGM Resorts will soon join a small group of resort neighbors — Treasure Island, SLS Las Vegas, Wynn, Encore, Venetian and Palazzo — that offer free self-parking.

In an email, Caesars Entertainment declined to comment on whether the company would join the unfolding free parking trend.

Paid parking woes

Paid parking has been a center of frustration of tourists remembering the old days.

“The parking fees are a gigantic deal for everybody. They gripe all the time about things they don't like. They hate resort fees. They hate paid parking worse,"" Anthony Curtis, founder of LasVegasAdvisor.com, told the USA TODAY Network.

One solution to paid parking woes has been avoiding casino-resorts that charge for parking, according to a 2018 Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance survey.

Data revealed almost 37 percent of respondents avoid parking at Strip casinos that charge for parking. About 7 percent said they visit the same hotel-casinos regardless of parking fee policies.

Short-term rental company Vrbo followed suit, too.

IHG, owner of hotel chains like InterContinental and Holiday Inn, followed many major hotel companies by announcing new cleanliness measures on May 18, in conjunction with Cleveland Clinic medical experts and Ecolab and Diversey hygiene experts. The in-progress changes may include hotel-wide extra deep-cleaning of high-touch surfaces, ""last cleaned"" charts and social distancing practices. Additional guidance for hotels may include Other changes might be individual amenity cleaning kits for guests, plus hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes in guest rooms.

Four Seasons is partnering with Johns Hopkins Medicine International for its new global health and safety program, ""Lead With Care."" The program notes that public areas will be cleaned hourly, with extra attention to areas like the front desk counters and public restrooms; kits with masks, hand sanitizer and sanitization wipes will be in each guest room; and restaurants and bars might operate at a limited capacity for social distancing purposes, among other initiatives.

Omni's ""Safe & Clean"" initiative includes a daily health screening for employees, with a temperature check. The company is expanding its use of Environmental Protection Agency- and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-approved disinfectants. Omni is increasing the cleaning of its heating and cooling systems and replacing air filters more often. High-traffic areas will become one-way where possible. Single-use items will be placed in guest rooms, and a limited-contact check-in and check-out process will become standard.

Caesars Entertainment is assuring guests its employees are well-versed in cleaning and disinfectant practices, which includes PPE use. Multiple handwashing stations have been added to the resort, and both slot machine banks and table games will allow for social distancing going forward, among other changes.

Accor 'ALLSAFE' plan includes temperature checks; partnership brings in telemedicine consultants

Accor's ""ALLSAFE"" plan, in addition to heightened cleanliness procedures, will include temperature checks for guests and partitions at front desks. For an extra health measure, as soon as July 2020 guests will also have free access to telemedicine consultants and have access to tens of thousands of medical professionals. Accor is working with insurance company AXA Partners.

MGM Resorts: Minimize drinking, no eating on the casino floor

MGM launched its ""Seven-Point Safety Plan,"" a new standard created with medical and scientific experts to curb the spread of coronavirus, respond to possible new cases and keep customers and employees safe.

In addition to upgraded incident response protocols and contactless check-in, some of the company's focuses will be:

Screening, temperature checks and employee training: Employees will be screened for signs and symptoms of infection, and will continue to go through temperature checks. Guests are encouraged to adhere to CDC guidelines for self-quarantine and to not travel if they think they have been exposed.

Mandatory masks and PPE: Employees will be given an approved mask to wear when on the property, and guests are encouraged to wear masks in public areas. Free masks will be offered to guests who need one. Guests should limit the amount of time they are drinking on the casino floor and should not eat there.

Physical distancing: Floor guides will be throughout properties making sure people adhere to six-foot distancing. But MGM is aware distancing could prove difficult. ""From time-to-time, six-foot distancing will be challenging – and in those cases, reasonable mitigating protocols will be implemented, such as plexiglass barriers or eye protection for employees,"" according to the new policy.

Hand washing and enhanced sanitization: On top of enhanced cleaning, MGM will deploy electrostatic sprayers for more efficient disinfecting. Hand washing and sanitizing stations will also be available in high-traffic spots, along with signage.

HVAC controls and air quality: MGM has worked to minimize risk of virus transmission with HVAC systems. HVAC systems will be reviewed and adjusted pending science and government guidance.

Red Roof's RediClean initiative launches

The budget hotel chain launched Red Roof RediClean, an enhanced cleanliness program to bolster guests' confidence to stay there again.

Red Roof is asking its staff to be thorough when cleaning guest rooms (i.e. sanitizing TVs, doorknobs, light switches, faucets, etc.), and staff is sanitizing common areas like elevators, laundry rooms and front desks up to four times each day.

The company has made signage explaining guests need to wear a face covering in public spaces, per government rules. If local or state governments require facial coverings in common areas where social distancing is more difficult — think laundry rooms or indoor hallways — guests must adhere to that mandate. They are encouraged to do so (with signage) in states not requiring this.

Wyndham: 'Count on Us'

Wyndham, which has more than 6,000 hotels in the U.S., announced a new initiative called ""Count on Us"", which includes updated cleaning and disinfection procedures for guest rooms and public spaces, plus easy access to health essentials.

The chain will ship products including face masks for hotel employees, disinfectant wipes for guests and hand sanitizer. Wyndham is also set to partner with Ecolab to use its disinfectants across guest rooms and public spaces.

Best Western announces 'We Care Clean' plan

Meanwhile, Best Western's rejiggered ""We Care Clean"" plan includes enhanced sanitization procedures at the front desk and lobby, upgraded grab and go breakfast offerings in most hotels and offered more strict cleaning of public amenities like pools and fitness centers.

The hotel brand is relying on guidance from the CDC, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the EPA and Health Canada.

Sandals rolls out 'Platinum Protocols of Cleanliness'

Sandals and Beaches Resorts, which has 24 properties in seven countries, has its own new sanitation rules. The chain's Platinum Protocols of Cleanliness Program will include precautionary temperature checks, personal anti-bacterial hand towels and individual in-room hand sanitizer, according to Sandals spokesperson Rachael Salzer. Each hotel room will be maintained using UV-LED lighting equipment to inspect cleanliness, air duct sanitization for each arrival and upon each departure and weekly carpet steam-cleaning.

Vrbo

Vrbo, part of Expedia Group, has issued guidelines informed by the CDC , the World Health Organization and Cristal International Standards. Dr. Daniel Lucey, from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, advised the company. There are directives for disinfecting surfaces, ensuring time between bookings and keeping homes stocked with antibacterial hand soaps and hand sanitizers.

Homeowners and property managers will have the ability to report whether guests can check in and out without person-to-person contact or if the property can't accommodate 24 hours between guests. Guests will be able to see this information on the Vrbo app and website once hosts detail the information to the company.

The company is also offering a flexible cancellation search filter.

Hyatt aims to introduce new cleanliness accreditation process

Hyatt announced cleanliness measures last week, announcing it is relying on medical experts, industry professionals and others to ensure guests feel safe.

""We must critically examine the hotel experience from every vantage point – from our rooms and our lobbies to our spas and dining – bringing in the latest research, technology and innovation to make that happen,"" Mark Hoplamazian, Hyatt president and CEO, said in a statement.

By September, every Hyatt hotel is expected to have someone trained as a ""hygiene manager,"" who will make sure their hotel adheres to new guidelines.

These may include social distancing guidelines, prominent hand sanitizer placement, food safety and hygiene protocol implementation for restaurants and room service and increased cleaning frequency with hospital-grade disinfectants on high-touch surfaces, shared spaces and in guest rooms.

Hyatt is also developing new work procedures and trainings for its employees to address their safety and the safety of guests. This includes daily surveys that will assess colleague comfort, hotel cleanliness and more.

The company also aims to introduce a new accreditation process in May from the Global Biorisk Advisory Council across hundreds of hotels; Hyatt says it is the first to do so. This council, made up of leaders in the microbial-pathogenic threat analysis and mitigation space, is a division of ISSA, the global cleaning industry association.

Hyatt has been working with infectious disease and occupational health experts to develop the program.

As individual hotel chains, including Hyatt, Hilton and Marriott, announce their cleaning initiatives during the coronavirus pandemic, the industry at large is also working to implement to new standards to make guests feel safe.

The American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) unveiled its Safe Stay guidelines on May 4, an effort made in conjunction with major brands like Hilton, Marriott and Best Western to standardize cleanliness.

""It's really an effort to make sure that no matter if you're staying at an extended-stay economy hotel or you're staying at the nicest luxury resort, that there will be at a minimum common standards across the entire industry,"" Chip Rogers, AHLA president and CEO, told USA TODAY.

The report outlines baseline hotel practices and procedures (you can find the full guidelines here) meant to protect employees and guests.

Hilton's new cleaning protocols

Hilton also said this week that it is partnering with the company behind Lysol, as well as the Mayo Clinic, to better ensure cleanliness in its hotels. The new program will be called ""Hilton CleanStay"" and aims to to give guests peace of mind when staying at a Hilton property, whether they are in guest rooms, restaurants, the gym or other public areas.

Full details are being ironed out, but several initiatives in development include:

An official room seal indicating that a room hasn't been accessed after a deep cleaning

The removal of pen, paper and guest directories in favor of a digital option (or available on request)

Contactless check-in, where guests can complete check-in and check-out processes via a mobile app and receive a digital room key (Hilton Honors members already have access to digital keys)

Electrostatic sprayers and ultraviolet light to be used in the sanitization process

Marriott updates cleaning procedures

Marriott said it will use electrostatic sprayers with hospital-grade disinfectants to sanitize throughout its hotels. In addition to guest rooms, the sprayers will be used in lobbies, gyms and other public areas. It said the cleaning agents used would be those recommended by the CDC and Prevention and the WHO to kill all known pathogens.

In addition, the company is testing ultraviolet light technology for sanitizing room keys and adding hand sanitizer stations and signs in the lobby to remind anyone who enters to keep their distance from others. Marriott is also taking a look at what to do at properties that offer buffet service.

Choice Hotels starts 'Commitment to Clean' program

Choice Hotels, too, announced a new cleaning program, which will focus on furniture arrangement to promote social distancing, stronger cleaning protocols for higher-traffic areas like front desks and personal protective equipment for hotel staff.

The ""Commitment to Clean"" program will involve the chain working with Ecolab and guidance from the CDC, WHO , U.S. Travel Association and AHLA's Safe Stay Advisory Council.

Airbnb issues cleaning recommendations

Airbnb is establishing a new recommended ""cleaning protocol"" with the goal of reassuring both rental property hosts and their guests.

For hosts, the guidelines will offer recommendations for personal protective gear, such as masks and gloves, while cleaning. Rentals will be spaced out by 24 hours for hosts who have opted in to the cleaning protocols, and hosts will have the option of an online feature that automatically prevents bookings less than 72 hours apart for an extra measure of safety.

Turnkey introduces coronavirus cleaning tips

The vacation rental service announced updates to its GuestWorks cleaning system and verification technology to best combat coronavirus. Prior to the pandemic, TurnKey was already using a housekeeping scheduler, keyless locks and in-home tablet, among other amenities, and had eliminated the need for in-person communication.

Now the system will be upgraded with updated checklists to help housekeepers disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs, handles and light switches. In the cleaning system's app, housekeepers will have to confirm and verify through a photo the use of COVID-19-eliminating products.

It will require a 24-hour period between guest stays in May and June of this year and will extend this if necessary. Housekeepers and home inspections by TurnKey staff are permissible between stays, however.

But the coronavirus has thwarted her plans at every turn.

Senter and her husband, Gene, booked a trip from home in Indianapolis to Daytona Beach, Florida, for early May. When the chances of the city reopening by that pointseemed remote, she rebooked for June 15, assuming the pandemic would have played out by then. Now with that date a few weeks away, she figures there's still a heightened chance of contracting COVID-19. That's a risk she's unwilling to take as caregiver to her 90-year-old mother.

""I keep trying to tell myself so many people have it way worse off than we do,"" said Senter, who worries she may lose the $1,000 in reservations she has plunked down already. ""But that doesn't discount my feelings. I am disappointed.""

Other families are facing the same tough decisions about their vacations this year.

A visit to the Eastern shore is a rite of summer for many. From Maine to Florida, Atlantic beach towns attract visitors ready to frolic in the waves, savor fries or frozen custard on the boardwalk or simply soak up rays under a beach umbrella.

But this year, fears of the coronavirus are throwing plans by the wayside. Those who considered the annual trek to East Coast beaches as fundamental as visiting family at Thanksgiving are being forced to reconsider.

The fears go beyond simply a higher risk of catching the virus. Inconsistent policies by states and communities are making it hard to plan as local officials decide how to best try to salvage economies while emerging from strict stay-at-home orders.

Policies vary widely in some states, a hodgepodge of rules from one beach town to the next. In others, the states have rules in place that impede summer visitors.

In Rhode Island, Gov. Gina Raimondo said Scarborough and East Matunuck beaches would be the first to welcome beachgoers. But there will be restrictions. The number of parking spaces will be significantly reduced, bathrooms and concession stands will be closed, and there will be no lifeguards.

In Middletown, Rhode Island, the town administrator said details on how to handle summer beach visitors were still being worked out. ""Each beach is different, and the town council needs to decide what's best for Middletown,"" Shawn Brown said in an email.

Tourism-related businesses have been stymied by a policy of requiring out-of-staters to self-quarantine for 14 days.

“I’m hoping it’s the first week of June that the quarantine is lifted, but by July 1 at the latest,” said Walter Andrews, general manager of the Newport Marriott, the largest hotel in Newport, Rhode Island. “It’s crucial we have a date. I can’t make a move without direction from the state.”

New York state beaches will reopen the Friday before Memorial Day weekend, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. In announcing the reopening, the state joins New Jersey, Delaware and Connecticut.

But expect to find new rules at any beach. Those flocking to Cocoa Beach, Florida, must not gather in groups of more than five and must stay at least 6 feet from other groups. Violators face potential $500 fines. Wrightsville Beach in North Carolina has limited groups to 10 and doesn't allow sunbathing or just sitting – only ""non-stationary exercise activities"" like walking, jogging, swimming and surfing/water sports.

As summer nears, the restrictions could ease and the crowds will follow, beach town locals predict.

""People are tired of being cooped up in the house, and once the governor gives that OK, it's going to get crowded again,"" said Devon Byrd, who lives in Virginia Beach, Virginia.

But if COVID-19 cases start to increase, the rules – and perhaps new ones – could be reimposed. Against that backdrop of uncertainty, families are having to lay bets about whether try to attempt their usual vacations.

Scott Kessler of Stuarts Draft, Virginia, and his family typically visit Virginia Beach several times a year. They stay at the Best Western Sandcastle on 13th Street. They always eat at Captain George’s Seafood Restaurant. They schedule their trips for August or September so they can attend an Old Dominion University football game.

This year, the plan was to go Sept. 4 to watch Old Dominion University play Wake Forest University, and then make a weekend of it by getting in some beach time. Facing COVID-19, Kessler is uncertain if that will happen.

“We're likely going to wait to see what happens to the virus before we make any concrete plans,” Kessler said.

He’s hoping conditions are better later in the summer. Even if he can go, he knows it won't be the same.

Kessler said they probably won’t eat at Captain George’s. They’ll still likely take a swim in the ocean, but do so while practicing social distancing.

Going to a crowded football game is a concern, but if the family goes, Kessler said they’ll wear face masks.

Amie Michael of Mount Sidney, Virginia, usually goes with her family to Virginia Beach shortly after school is out for the year. She’s a teacher and with one child still in high school and another in college, it’s an end-of-school-year celebration. They're waiting to see what happens.

“It has been booked for months,” she said. “We are still hoping to go but will cancel if the beach doesn't open.”

If they do go, dining and activities around towns could be challenges. Even though popular Rehoboth Beach in Delaware's boardwalk and beach have reopened, bars and restaurants are still takeout only. Short-term rentals and hotels are also not yet back.

Merchants, whose fortunes depend on strong summer business, are hoping for the best. They know this will be a summer like no other – both in terms of how many customers to expect and the precautions they will need to take to keep them safe.

""I think it could be a healthy mix of apprehension and excitement,"" said Karen Sphar, executive vice president of the Southport Oak Island Area Chamber of Commerce in North Carolina. ""If you are a business owner, you are extremely excited and ready to go. You may have been limping along a little bit, but now you are looking forward to getting business back into your establishment.""

Vacationers may want to isolate themselves in beach shacks or seaside apartments that they can treat as their own homes with less worry about the coronavirus left behind by past guests. They will be encouraged to shun crowds.

""People want to get away and have a safe vacation,"" said Isaac Baker, marketing director for Treasure Realty in Topsail Beach, North Carolina. ""There's no better place to be than in the sunshine on the beach.""

On Monday, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority and R&R Partners – the advertising company behind the ""What happens here"" campaign – launched a new 30-second television spot, reports the Reno Gazette Journal, which is part of the USA TODAY Network.

""The world has changed,"" a narrator says, ""and Vegas is changing with it.""

The ad is a response to the post-pandemic Las Vegas landscape – one that shut down in March to stem the spread of COVID-19, leaving thousands out of work and resorts scrambling to develop reopening plans.

The new campaign is called “Reimagined” and offers a toned-down glimpse of Las Vegas tourism, focusing on outdoor recreation and intimate settings. One shot shows a man and woman in a warm bar conversation, a glass of wine separating them.

""Things will be a little different when we open again – at least for a while,"" the narrator says. ""We're working to make it more intimate, with more space and the excitement you've come to expect.""

The new Las Vegas ad comes four months after tourism authorities unveiled the destination's new slogan: ""What happens here, only happens here.""

Las Vegas resorts prepare to reopen

In the aftermath of COVID-19, the casino experience in Las Vegas and greater Nevada will look a much different.

The Nevada Gaming Commission recently approved the Gaming Control Board's reopening policies, laying out what more than 400 large and small casinos need to do when shutdown orders are lifted.

Occupancy limits in gaming areas will be cut in half. Tourists will see chairs and stools in front of every other gaming machine. Gathering in groups – one time a staple of the Las Vegas experience – will be prohibited.

Dealers will even offer card players a complimentary squirt of sanitizer between hands.

COVID-19 is still spreading in Nevada

As tourism authorities plot new ways to entice travelers to return, the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise in Nevada.

The number of Nevadan’s who’ve tested positive for COVID-19 increased to 6,906 on Monday, an increase of 49 new positive cases.

That rise is comparatively low to what the state has seen for nearly two months. The last time Nevada saw a lower single-day increase was March 24, when there were 43 new cases, according to a Reno Gazette Journal analysis of the numbers.

But Monday’s small increase is not necessarily a good sign.

While few people tested positive statewide, Nevada performed its smallest number of tests in several weeks – just 1,140. That figure is eclipsed by the 6,500 tests performed the day before.

With 49 positive residents out of a total of 1,140 tested, Nevada’s test positivity rate went up for the first time since May 2. That metric, which measures the proportion of people who test positive on a given day, increased from 8.5% to 8.6%.

The total number of Nevadans who’ve died from COVID-19 had not yet been updated on Monday and remains at 350.

Not one flew out.

So far this past week, planes owned by Avianca Ecuador, Air Canada and its regional carrier Jazz Aviation, and a contract carrier from Bangor, Maine, have arrived at Pinal Air Park near Marana.

They carried no passengers and only a skeleton crew, usually just a pilot and a first officer, and those planes, too, never left, reports The Arizona Republic, which is part of the USA TODAY Network.

In the last 10 days more than 50 jetliners have filed final flight plans to the converted World War II training base.

They are part of a wave of ghost flights landing at an unprecedented rate at desert airstrips all over the Southwest near places like Marana and Kingman in Arizona, Mojave and Victorville in California, Roswell, New Mexico, and Abilene, Texas.

The planes will sit in storage at the airstrips as airlines deal with the economic shocks of the COVID-19 crisis. Since Feb. 20, airline passenger traffic is down an estimated 95%, and industry stocks have lost two-thirds of their value.

Rather than flying empty planes, most airlines are parking significant portions of their fleets, which even for a short term involves an intricate maintenance schedule to make sure the planes are airworthy if and when they are needed again.

'A sense of sadness'

One pilot, a seasoned veteran with a major airline, flew into Pinal Air Park in a jet with just one other person on board, a first officer.

""It's a little eerie,"" he said.

Taking off was a different experience as well because the plane was extremely light with no passengers or baggage

The pilot spoke on the condition of anonymity because his company had not authorized him to talk with the media.

The scene at the air park was surreal, he said. The facility has no air traffic control tower, a fairly short runway and no landing lights or visual approach indicators. But what really stood out is the massive number of aircraft parked there.

""You get this sense of impressiveness because you see so many planes from all over the world way out where nobody would ever think of going,"" he said.

""At the same time there's a profound sense of sadness that goes along with it because you know why they're there, and it sort of hits you that this plane you're flying is not going to be flying again, maybe forever, but certainly not for a long time,"" the pilot said. ""You know this is affecting people's lives, and that definitely hits you a bit. ""

Airlines mothball more planes

Most airlines routinely retire aircraft and place them in storage, but the pace has been dramatically accelerated because of the pandemic.

According to Airlines for America, an industry lobbying organization, U.S. air carriers have idled nearly 3,200 planes in recent months, about 52% of the nation's active fleet.

Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport public information officer Greg Roybal said that as of Wednesday, five airlines had parked a total of 39 planes indefinitely at the airport, but said the situation remains fluid.

Elsewhere, American Airlines, the nation's largest carrier in terms of fleet size, has parked 54 planes on an unused runway at Tulsa International Airport and has also idled planes at airports in Pittsburgh and Mobile, Alabama, according to published reports.It is also storing aircraft at Roswell Air Center, in New Mexico, which, like Marana Air Park, is a converted World War II military facility.

Delta, the largest American airline in terms of revenue and the third-largest in terms of fleet size, is mothballing 600 planes, about half its fleet, during the crisis, said corporate spokeswoman Maria Moraitakis.

The airline had already planned to retire 76 older MD-88 and MD-90 aircraft at the end of the year, but moved up plans and will phase out all of them by June, Moraitakis said.

At least 50 Delta planes have been parked at Marana, which, like other desert operations, provides an ideal climate for storing planes because the low humidity helps prevent corrosion.

Storage areas are filling up

Scott Butler, chief commercial officer of Ascent Aviation Services, which operates the Pinal Air Park runway and storage operations, said in an e-mail interview that companies have placed about 250 planes in storage there since March, bringing the Marana operation to about 85% of its capacity.

He said the facility has received planes from 15 countries and five continents in the last several months.

The Marana facility primarily handles larger planes and wide-body jets. A smaller facility in Tucson handles smaller and intermediate jets typically used by regional carriers. That facility is at roughly 60% of capacity, Butler said.

Before the COVID-19 crisis, the company was operating at about 30% of capacity, and the increased activity has led the company to increase its workforce by about 125 full-time equivalents.

Butler said most airlines are placing aircraft in what he called “short-term storage,” which, depending on specifications by different aircraft manufacturers, typically means from 30 to 90 days, though some are retiring aircraft for good, which involves an extensive decommissioning process.

Ascent Aviation spokeswoman Annette Feasel said the process of storing an aircraft is complex.

""Each aircraft manufacturer has different guidelines,"" she said, depending on whether it's an ""active parking situation or short or long-term storage.""

More complex than parking a car

Active parking may mean the company has to start the engines every seven to 10 days and fire up other systems to ensure they are working so the plane remains airworthy.

Short- or long-term storage entails more extensive operations, possibly including the removal of engines. Typically, the longer planes have been in storage, the longer it takes to reactivate them.

She added that airplanes are ""built to be in the air and they don't like to be on the ground. The longer they're on the ground and they're in various weather and different types of conditions, it's detrimental to the aircraft.""

""When you think about your automobile, you do have to change the oil and do a few things, but if your car sits for a week or two, and nothing happens, you're still going to be in fairly good shape,"" Feasel said. ""An airplane needs a lot more than that.""

She said with nearly 400 planes on the property, operations are going on constantly. The people who maintain the planes are just as important as the people who fly them, but get little recognition.

""In order to maintain airworthiness there's a lot of tasks that have to happen every day, and the people who are doing that, they deserve to be acknowledged,"" she said.

Paul Stone, who had served as Hertz's executive vice president and chief retail operations officer, North America, will become CEO and president immediately, the company announced Monday.

Marinello's resignation was reported in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing dated May 15. She will remain with Hertz in a consulting position for up to one year to support a smooth transition, the company says.

""Having successfully run our largest business segment for the last two years, Paul helped strengthen our brands by elevating service standards across the North American car rental operations."" said Henry R. Keizer, Hertz's chairman, in a statement.

Prior to joining Hertz in March 2018, Stone, 50, served as senior vice president and chief retail officer at Cabela's. He began his career with Sam's Club and Walmart where he became western U.S. divisional senior vice president.

""I thank Kathy and look forward to working with my colleagues to do what Hertz people do best – anticipate where transportation, mobility and technology are going and innovate to best serve our customers, stakeholders and communities,"" Stone said in a statement.

Marinello's departure comes about two weeks after Hertz, in a separate SEC filing, said it had begun negotiating with lenders to negotiate ""a financing strategy and structure that better reflects the economic impact"" of COVID-19.

Hertz's action then came amid widespread reports that the company was headed toward a potential bankruptcy filing.

In the May 4 filing, the company said it ""faces significant ongoing operating expenses,"" including agreements that commit the company to leasing more vehicles than it currently needs. Hertz had announced April 14 that it would cut about 10,000 jobs.

Two months ago, when Hertz announced furloughs, Marinello said she would give up 100% of her base salary. According to an SEC filing, Marinello earned more than $8 million in total compensation in 2018. That included a base salary of $1.45 million, which remains the same under a new employment agreement she signed in November.

""The hardest part about stepping down is leaving the amazing employees that have earned my respect over the last three-and-a-half years. It was an honor to serve them,"" said Marinello. ""I am confident that under Paul's leadership, Hertz will prosper long into the future.""",100,High,Center,USA,1

It's the creative concept that an Ocean City, Maryland, restaurant unveiled over the weekend to keep patrons at least 6 feet apart once the governor gave the OK for restaurants and bars to reopen.

Shaped like oversized inner tubes, the tables were custom made for Fish Tales, where employees rolled them out of a large box truck for their Facebook live debut over the weekend, reports the Salisbury Daily Times, which is a part of the USA TODAY Network.

""It's like a bumper boat, but it's actually a table,"" owner Shawn Harmon said of the design, which was developed by Revolution Event Design and Production in Baltimore.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had restaurants and bars across Maryland shuttered – with the exception of carryout and delivery service – since mid-March in an effort to curb the virus's spread.

Now that the state has eased into stage one of its gradual Roadmap to Recovery, eateries are itching to one day soon hopefully resume dine-in service.

Fish Tales is providing curbside and carryout service seven days a week and has also put significant distance between its outdoor tables in anticipation of being able to wait on patrons again.

""We've taken this very seriously from the beginning, and we just want to let everyone know what we've done in the interim to make sure that everybody stays safe and Ocean City can stay open,"" Harmon said in a social media video about the measures the establishment has taken.

It's the creative concept that an Ocean City, Maryland, restaurant unveiled over the weekend to keep patrons at least 6 feet apart once the governor gave the OK for restaurants and bars to reopen.

Shaped like oversized inner tubes, the tables were custom made for Fish Tales, where employees rolled them out of a large box truck for their Facebook live debut over the weekend, reports the Salisbury Daily Times, which is a part of the USA TODAY Network.

BANGKOK (AP) — Thailand’s flag carrier Thai Airways International will file a plan for restructuring its business with the Central Bankruptcy Court, a government spokeswoman said Monday.

Narumon Pinyosinwat said the plan submitted by the State Enterprise Policy Office to salvage the airline will be submitted Tuesday to for Cabinet approval. She said she had no details of the plan.

Thai Airways had been suffering financially even before the coronavirus crisis brought travel and tourism in the country to a near standstill.

The coronavirus travel crisis shuttered these three US airlines. Will more go under as well?

The airline initially sought a $1.7 billion bailout loan from the government. There is speculation that its reorganization under bankruptcy could take the government’s ownership share below 50%, effecting a form of privatization. All rescue options were likely to lead in cuts in staff, fleet and flights.

Thai Airways logged losses of $374.3 million in 2019, $361.9 million in 2018 and $65.8 million in 2017.

Thai media reports say it is carrying a debt burden of almost $9.4 billion.

The airline stopped all its flights at the beginning of April as Thailand imposed strict precautions to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Almost all its staff were put on leave at greatly reduced salaries. The government last week extended to the end of June a ban on arrivals on international passenger flights, ruling out their immediate resumption.",100,High,Center,USA,1

“Going through an airport, the whole travel experience, will be as enjoyable as open-heart surgery,” Dubai Airports CEO Paul Griffiths recently told Bloomberg, adding that precautionary measures like personal protective equipment and social distancing restrictions can only be short-term solutions while waiting on a vaccine.

“This crisis is unlike anything we've ever seen in the aviation business,” he added. “We're dealing with a monster.”

In the meantime, many airlines have intensified aircraft cleaning, using electrostatic sprayers and a host of other measures. They have introduced new boarding procedures and are blocking middle seats to promote social distancing.

""Safety will no longer be limited to flight safety but personal safety as well,'' Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in an interview on CNBC last month. ""We've doubled down – in fact, tripled down – on sanitation and hygiene (and) cleanliness.""

The new normal? U.S. airlines announce requirements for passengers to wear face masks

All major U.S. airlines and an increasing number of airports now require passengers to wear masks or other face coverings. McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas became the first airport last week to introduce vending machines selling personal protective equipment including face masks, gloves, hand sanitizer and wipes.

JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes told CNBC last month that some of those temporary measures airlines are currently taking, such as asking travelers to wear masks, might become permanent policies.

Bastian concurred, predicting that new permanent in-flight changes to promote social distancing could include new seating plans, fewer passengers per flight and immunity passports.

""Just as with 9/11, I definitely think we're going to see some things here change for good,"" Hayes said.

The Associated Press

BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) — The Maseratis, the Rolls-Royces and the Mercedes-Benzes were back on Rodeo Drive on Tuesday — along with a few high-end buyers — as America’s most fashionable shopping street slowly got back to business.

Just a few days after Beverly Hills officials announced the high-end boutiques lining its most exclusive street could reopen for curbside pickup, shoppers began tentatively making their way onto its wide sidewalks and narrow roadway.

They came looking for things like Gucci handbags, Salvatore Ferragamo shoes, Louis Vuitton belts and other items with names that scream out to passersby, “This is ridiculously expensive.”

One young man pulled up in front of the Fendi store, paid for a pair of shoes and sunglasses that he quickly tossed into the back of his red convertible sports car as he explained they were gifts for his wife, then sped away.

Nearby, Delicia Cordon of Atlanta stood outside the Gucci store looking at purses and backpacks a salesperson inside sent photos of to her phone. She picked out the perfect ones for her daughter’s 11th birthday, punched in her credit-card information and did a quick exchange at the door. The sales associate who handed the items to her declined to talk before pulling the door back shut.

For Cordon, who had to catch a plane home in just a few hours, scoring the purse and backpack was an incredible stroke of good fortune. There’s a Gucci store in her hometown, she said, but it doesn’t have a children’s department and she feared if she ordered online the gifts wouldn’t arrive by her daughter’s birthday on Friday.

“I was surprised that they were doing the curbside and I was really excited,” said the Atlanta fashion designer.

The street was only lightly trafficked with both pedestrians and motorists on a beautiful, sun-dappled Southern California afternoon, so Cordon said she never feared getting too close to anybody.

“I had to wear my mask. I had my gloves on,” she added.

Most others on the street also had masks as did everyone inside the stores. Many of the store employees briskly wiped down windows and surfaces when not handing out purchases.

Among the buyers was Michael Carter of Providence, Rhode Island, who got a belt and sneakers at the Louis Vuitton store.

The owner of a used-car lot noted this is his first trip to California, adding he wasn’t going to pass on Rodeo Drive even if some of the stores were still closed and he had to order ahead online and then have his purchases handed to him through the door.

“Where I’m from we don’t have places like this,” said Carter, who was on a brief vacation. “When we’re down here we’ve got to take advantage of it.”

Chad Wolf, the acting Secretary of Homeland Security, announced Tuesday that the U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico land border closure has been extended until June 22.

""The President has made it clear that we must continue to keep legitimate, commercial trade flowing while limiting those seeking to enter our country for non-essential purposes,"" Wolf wrote in a statement. ""Non-essential travel will not be permitted until this administration is convinced that doing so is safe and secure.""

He continued: ""We have been in contact with our Canadian and Mexican counterparts and they also agree that extending these restrictions is prudent at this time. We appreciate our partnership with Mexico and Canada in ensuring that North America is working together to combat the ongoing global pandemic.""

US-Canada border closure: What it means for travelers

Canada

Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau held a press conference, saying the extension of the closure was a mutual agreement between the United States and Canada.

""It was the right thing to further extend by 30 days our closure of the Canada-U.S. border to travelers other than essential services and goods, but we will continue to watch carefully what's happening elsewhere in the world and around us as we make decisions on next steps,"" Trudeau said Tuesday.

During the French portion of his address, he noted there had been a push from Canada's provinces to keep the restrictions intact for now because the border is a place of ""vulnerability,"" according to the Canadian Broadcasting Company's interpreter.

The U.S. and Canada first limited travel in March for a period of 30 days after President Donald Trump and Trudeau agreed to close the border to help contain the spread of coronavirus. The State Department said that the order ""does not apply to air, rail, or sea travel at this time, but does apply to commuter rail and ferry travel.""

Trump tweeted March 18, ""We will be, by mutual consent, temporarily closing our Northern Border with Canada to non-essential traffic. Trade will not be affected.""

The border's closure was then extended for an additional 30 days on April 18, with Trudeau explaining, “The agreement is the same terms. It’s just extended for another 30 days. It will ensure we continue to get essential goods and services back and forth across the border.""

Nearly 200,000 people cross the U.S.-Canada border daily in normal times.

“We will continue to take the measures necessary to keep Canadians safe while ensuring the continued flow of our essential supply chains on which so many Canadians depend,” Trudeau said in April.

Essential cross-border workers like health care professionals, airline crews and truck drivers will still be permitted to cross. Truck drivers are critical as they supply grocery stores and medical goods in both directions. Much of Canada’s food supply comes from or via the U.S.

Mexico

The U.S. and Mexico first limited travel in March for a period of 30 days after Trump said the country agreed to close the border to help stem the spread of the coronavirus. Like Canada, the US-Mexican border closure was extended multiple times.

Wolf said that essential travel, including medical purposes, to attend educational institutions, for emergency response/public health purposes and lawful cross-border trade, would not be effected by the border closure.

US-Mexico border closure:What does that mean for travelers

For tourists, Mexico is the seventh most-visited country around the world, according to Mexico tourism data, and 26 million U.S. travelers visited Mexico from January to August 2019, according to the U.S. National Travel and Tourism Office.

The Mexico-U.S. border has been a prominent and often contentious issue during Trump's tenure in the Oval Office. During his campaign ahead of the 2016 election, the ""build the wall"" movement, an effort to build a wall along the border to keep Mexican immigrants from entering the U.S., gained traction among his support base but stoked criticism among his detractors.

So she created the ""Still no Stimulus Check"" Facebook page on April 29.

""I am a stay at home mom of 4 kiddos,"" Dann, 28, wrote Wednesday in a post to the more than 1,000 members. She added that her husband is a kitchen manager at Chick-fil-A and his hours have been cut during the coronavirus pandemic. ""We are behind on our rent, car payment and electric bill. We have applied for assistance but (we're) afraid we might not meet the requirements.""

Motivated by delays in receiving their stimulus checks, people like Dann have created online groups that have attracted tens of thousands of members – and they’re doing more than just venting at the IRS. They’re also connecting in a personal way and, like Dann, disclosing details of their lives that might have been considered too sensitive to discuss publicly before the pandemic.

""We were depending on this check to get caught up with our bills,"" Dann told USA TODAY, whose family is expecting a two-person federal stimulus check bolstered by the $500 per child bonus.

Dann, who said she works one day at week at Chick-fil-A and handles mobile orders, said this is the first time she has created a private group on Facebook and that she did it to bring people together. Comments at ""Still no Stimulus Check"" reflect a potential shift toward more openness about personal financial matters.

Kimberly Dyer, who lives in Nashville and starts her day by checking the Facebook page. Dyer, along with Dann, serves as co-administrator of the private group

""We're hurting,'' said Dyer, 30. ""It just doesn't make sense.''

The mother of one, said the $1,700 in stimulus funds she is waiting on are critical because she is a foster care coordinator who has taken a 50% pay cut during the pandemic. Recently, Dyer said, she found herself sharing with members of the Facebook group that she had fallen behind on her rent payments.

""That’s not something I would ever tell anyone,"" she said. ""But it’s like we’re all in the same situation. We’re all struggling.""

Anecdotal evidence suggests more people are seeking financial advice and talking about their plight more openly during the pandemic, said Geoffrey Brown, CEO of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors.

Brown said financial advisers and financials planners are talking about the current situation as ""excellent example of the intersection of money and psychology.''

""Meaning that in the past we’ve had economic crises where people have felt it in their pocketbook and there was a psychological component to that,'' Brown said. ""But now you’re dealing with a health crisis and an economic crisis and I think it’s just really causing people to be a little bit more open, a little bit more forthcoming in how it’s effecting their lives in total.

""If this had happened 20 years ago, looking at it holistically we wouldn’t have had access to the communications mediums that we do now. So you couldn’t jump into a Facebook where you’re disclosing that sort of information.""

Lisa Gale of Springfield, Missouri, recently wrote in the ""Still no Stimulus Check"" groupthat she had 73 cents in her bank account and is living in a motel. (She told USA TODAY she is a vacation planner for Wyndham Destinations and has been unable to work during the pandemic.)

Kaydee Robinson of Oklahoma City wrote that she needs the stimulus funds in part because she is pregnant with her second child who is due June 7.

Amanda Butler Baldonado of East Layton, Utah, wrote that she and her husband have eight children, including three that have ""severe medical needs,"" and she is an independent contractor who has been out of work since March 12. ""We are barely surviving,"" she wrote.

Sharing your financial struggles can be daunting

Similarly, Alyssa Snyder, who started the Facebook page ""Updated Not Stimulated,"" said she is wary of scammers who use tales of distress to solicit money.

""You have to decipher if it was a real story of not,"" said Snyder, 32, who lives in Washington Court, Ohio with her husband and two children. She said she recently received the $3,400 stimulus funds her family was due. ""People have hearts and want to help people.""

In fact, Snyder said, members of her private group donated about $500 in gift cards, along with gift baskets from members who make homemade skin care products and homemade lip gloss.

Rather than shuttering the group after most of the approximately 4,000 members received their stimulus funds, Snyder said, she renamed it ""Consequential Strangers"" and maintained the community.

""When I started this page, I didn’t think it would become anything like this,"" she said. ""I was just trying to get answers and seeing if anybody was in the same situation I was in.""

On another platform but with a similar thought, Andrew Gardiner of Stoors, Connecticut, said he was stunned to watch the ""stimuluscheck"" subreddit he created on Reddit attract more than 20,000 members.

Gardiner, 24, who builds websites and does online marketing, said he received $1,200 in stimulus funds April 15 by direct deposit. But he has stayed active on the subreddit that he created to be a source of information and also has become something more.

Baby photos have been posted, someone offered to buy pizza for people who were hungry and the comments kept on flooding in.

""I WANT TO PUNCH THE IRS WEBSITE,"" wrote Dunkaroosarecool.

""Yep,"" wrote Reddit user uiguigoo. ""I make 30k a year. … rent (was)due Friday and I've already missed two months. Can't be evicted(right now), but gonna leave voluntarily to avoid more late fees.""

This week, user uiguigoo indicated they are still is waiting on stimulus funds.

""I don't care anymore,"" they wrote. ""Already kicked out of my apartment. I'm living out of my car now. I'm already in debt due to late fees and missed payments. I'm already ruined. $1,200 won't do (anything) for me now.""

IM_NOT_BALD_YET chimed in: ""I’m just here to cheer you all on. Fingers crossed!""

Stockdale

24/7 Wall Street

Since the lockdown caused by concerns over the spread of coronavirus, people have been left to their own devices at home, and those include cell phones, laptops, iPads, video games and television remote controls, among others.

Before the pandemic, these devices were frequently used – they are sometimes called high-touch items – and now that so many of us are home, they are being handled even more often, and not necessarily by a single user. That raises the specter of spreading the dreaded coronavirus. It is transmitted via droplets from the nose or mouth when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales.

24/7 Tempo has compiled a list of cleaning tips for your phones, tablets and other devices. We reviewed articles in trade publications, as well as general media sources to create our list.

Those using electronic devices need to clean the plastic and steel surfaces with the proper disinfectants. These are the kinds of surfaces where the coronavirus can survive for up to 72 hours. Most of the products used for cleaning might already be available in your home. The American Chemistry Council has a list of EPA-approved products. Soap and hot water is also a safe option that will help reduce the spread of the virus. Obviously, always use common sense when cleaning electronics: unplug them first, do not submerge them, and only use a small amount of cleaner on a cloth so that moisture doesn't enter any openings.

Cell phones

The two leading cell-phone makers updated their websites to inform customers how to clean those devices. Apple said on its website that iPhones can be safely cleaned with disinfectant wipes, including products such as Clorox sheets. Samsung said you can wipe down the device with a microfiber cloth containing an alcohol-based solution (70%). A National Institute of Infectious Disease study of mobile phones from 2017 found a median of more than 17,000 bacterial gene copies on each.

Tablets

A tablet is a portable computer such as an iPad. You can use alcohol-based agents to clean your device and attention should be paid to the screen and buttons. Remove any case on the tablet and clean underneath. When you put the case back on, wipe down the outside of it.

Phone chargers

Cleaning phone chargers to remove dirt and other impurities, as well as viruses, can be tricky. You can use a can of compressed air and spray the air in short bursts into the port. Otherwise, bring the charger to be cleaned by a professional.

Touch screens

Computer touch screens can be cleaned by using a small amount of warm, soapy water or a solution made to specifically clean touch screens. When cleaning, use a microfiber cloth to avoid scratching the screen. Mixing water and rubbing alcohol works, too but any mixture of more than 50% alcohol might damage the screen and remove the coating that protects it from fingerprints.

Keyboards

Keyboards have lots of germs and are potential virus havens. Researchers at the University of Arizona found that the average desktop has 400 times more bacteria than the average toilet seat. A New England Journal of Medicine study showed that the coronavirus was still detectable on plastic and steel for up to 72 hours, meaning viruses can live longer on non-porous surfaces such as keyboards. Keyboards should be unplugged and then shaken. Then they can be cleaned by gently wiping them down by using a 70% alcohol solution or disinfecting wipes. Stay away from bleach and don't let moisture into the openings.

Remote controls

Now that we're sheltering in place, we're watching a lot more television and using the remote control, which can potentially harbor the coronavirus. Among the cleaning agents that are effective for cleaning remote controls are Clorox cleaner and bleach products, Lysol disinfectants, Purell sanitizers, and Zep disinfectants. The American Chemistry Council has a list of products approved by the EPA.

Mouse

Like many devices, your mouse can be cleaned using products such as Clorox cleaner and bleach products, Lysol disinfectants, Purell sanitizers, and Zep disinfectants. Before you start cleaning, unplug your mouse and remove batteries. Researchers have found that the virus can survive for up to three days on plastic and steel, which are commonly used in electronic devices like the mouse.

Monitors

Computer monitors don't receive frequent contact from hands, but viruses can still settle on them so they should be cleaned periodically. Cleaning agents should not come into direct contact with the monitors and instead droplets of the agent should be applied to a microsoft fiber cloth, which can then be used to clean the monitor.

PCs

Personal computers can harbor germs and viruses, and the risk rises as more people use the same device. A study published in the American Journal of Infection Control said bacteria and other potentially hazardous microbes can be present on shared computer terminals and may be transmitted to users. Before cleaning a PC, unplug the device. PCs can be cleaned by using a lint-free cloth made from microfiber. Don't use aerosol sprays or abrasive cleaning agents and don't spray cleaners directly on the computer. Make sure no moisture enters any openings.

Laptops

Often receiving daily use, laptops can be major carriers of germs, thereby potentially spreading bacteria and disease. A 2018 New York Times article recommended laptop users begin by turning the machine off and removing the battery, if easily done, then cleaning out all of the crevices using canned air. The outside can then be wiped down using a microfiber cloth with a few drops of rubbing alcohol added to it – never apply alcohol directly to the computer. The screen can be wiped using a microfiber cloth dampened with plain water.

Nebulizers

Nebulizers are machines that spray medicine as a fine mist via a mouthpiece or mask, and are often used to treat asthma and other lung diseases. As nebulizers generate particles that can carry bacteria and viruses deep into one's lungs, some medical agencies, such as Canada's Alberta Health Services, have recommended their use be avoided during the pandemic. They can be cleaned by rinsing the cup with warm water and allowing it to air dry after each use and washing with warm, soapy water at the end of each day. They should be disinfected at least once per week.

Watches

The coronavirus can linger on the glass surface of watches. To eradicate the virus, use products such as Clorox wipes, alcohol-based sanitizers, or soap to disinfect the surface. Clorox wipes can be used to sterilize Apple Watches, though the company cautions customers not to use the agent on fabric or leather bands and not to use bleach. Infectious disease researchers recommend cleaning wearables such as Fitbit devices frequently.

Headphones

Headphones can collect debris and oil from one's skin, and generally pick up germs throughout the day. Due to their electronic nature, cleaning them can be tricky. One can use a towel with warm water mixed with a drop or two of a mild detergent. A small amount of alcohol may also be used, though depending on the type of headphones being cleaned, alcohol can have damaging effects. If it is used, it should be dried off carefully when done.

E-readers

The supply chain for e-reader companies – including Amazon and Sony – was thrown into disarray in January as the virulence of the coronavirus became known. Researchers have discovered that the virus can live for up to three days on plastic and steel, which are commonly used in electronic devices like e-readers. E-readers should be cleaned with products such as Clorox wipes, alcohol-based sanitizers, or soap and hot water to expunge the virus.

Printers

Printers have become ubiquitous in American homes along with laptops and personal computers and as such can also host the coronavirus. Owners of printers are advised to turn them off before cleaning. They should wear protective disposable rubber or nitrile gloves during cleaning. Areas of the printer that can come in contact with humans – control or cover panels, for example – need to be cleaned with a solution of 70%-plus isopropyl alcohol, although 99.9% isopropyl alcohol is recommended. Don't spray the solution directly on the device – put it on a lint-free rag or cloth. Use a glass cleaner for the copying surface. Before powering up, make sure all surfaces are dry.

Game consoles

Whether you are an XBox One or Playstation aficionado, you need to clean the consoles for these game systems. Game consoles qualify as so-called high-touch areas. Though the coronavirus is spread through droplets emitted by coughing or sneezing, particles can last for up to three days on plastic and steel. They can be cleaned by wiping them down with a 70% alcohol solution or disinfecting wipes. Rubbing alcohol can also be used if Clorox or Lysol wipes are in short supply.

Cameras

With so many people in lockdown, those sheltering in place are recording these extraordinary times in photographs. Shutterbugs need to be aware that bringing a camera to your face also exposes you to germs and viruses. Enthusiasts should wipe down the camera with a soft, dry cloth that contains denatured alcohol.

Fans

Whether or not the new coronavirus is airborne is still up for debate. However, fans – including ceiling fans, window fans, and those on stands – have the potential to spread aerosolized human pathogens. Those in the vicinity of fans can remove dust from the blades using a damp cloth or a vacuum cleaner with attachment. It's also recommended that those most at risk of the dangers of COVID-19 wear a face mask when fans are in use.

ATM machines

ATMs can be exceptionally dirty because of the many fingers touching their screens and keypads, as well as the presence of dollar bills, which are notoriously unclean. Following stay-at-home orders, many banks – including JPMorgan Chase and PNC – closed branches, requiring customers to rely on the machines. According to COVID-19 safety guidelines from the National ATM Council, users should wear disposable gloves or use hand sanitizer for any contact with ATM terminals and cash. They should also follow CDC guidelines, such as washing hands frequently with soap and water, avoiding touching one's face, and maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet from other people.

Amazon's new tablet

Available for preorder and available on June 3, Amazon’s all-new Fire HD 8 (from $89) features an 8-inch high-definition display, two cameras, twice the storage of the previous model (starting at 32 gigabytes and up to 1 terabyte with a microSD card), and 30% faster with the new 2.0 GHz quad-core processor.

In the battery department, Amazon says you expect up to 12 hours, plus Fire HD 8 now supports USB-C for easier charging.

Along with hundreds of thousands of apps, you’ve got support for the Alexa personal assistant and access to the optional $119/year Amazon Prime service, for millions of movies, TV shows, books, and songs, and shopping discounts and perks.

Extend your Wi-Fi

Is there anything more frustrating than “dead zones” in your home, which prevent you from getting fast and reliable Wi-Fi for your favorite devices? If you answered yes, you might consider the Netgear AC750 Wi-Fi Range Extender - Essentials Edition ($39).

As its name suggests, this small doohickey extends the range of any existing wireless router. Simply plug it into the wall and press the WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) button, and the same button on the back of your router, to initiate the digital handshake.

This dual-band product (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) is ideal for spreading your Wi-Fi (up to 750 megabits per second) to the basement, upstairs, or outdoor areas.

There’s also an Ethernet (wired) jack if you prefer to plug in a device, such as a video game console, streaming media player, or desktop computer.

A thrifty tracker from Fitbit

Even if budgets are tight, you can pick up a great-looking and fully functional wearable fitness device for the spring.

Available for $99, Fitbit Inspire HR is a sleek activity and sleep tracker designed to help you stay motivated and informed. The high-tech bracelet captures exercise information – such as steps taken, distance traveled, estimated calories burned, and heart rate – and shows the info on the watch or wirelessly on a companion app.

Other features include 5-day-plus battery life, personalized clock faces (and support for many optional bands), smartphone notifications (such as texts and calls), and more.

A smart SanDisk backup drive

Own an iPhone or iPad? Easily and quickly back-up your important photos and videos by snapping the SanDisk iXpand Mini Flash Drive into the Lightning port of your device, and it automatically backs-up your camera roll – just in case your phone or tablet is lost, stolen, or damaged.

On the other end of this flash drive is a USB 3.0 connector, which means you can plug it into a computer (PC, Mac) or television to view your photos and videos. You have an option to password-protect this flash drive, too.

Prices start at $22 for the 32GB version and go up to $78 for the 256GB model.

As a bonus, if you’re running out of room on your iPhone or iPad, you can keep the iXpand Mini Flash Drive plugged in to capture photos and videos directly onto the drive. Or watch videos straight from the drive itself.

Roku's dream streamer

Turn a regular TV into a smart TV. This is the premise behind the inexpensive Roku Streaming Stick+ ($49.99).

Simply plug this small stick into the back or side of your television (HDMI cable included), join your Wi-Fi, and then use the included voice remote (or optional Roku app) to stream hundreds of thousands of movies and TV episodes – in up to 4K quality with High Dynamic Range (HDR) for exceptional contrast, brightness and color (providing your television supports these technologies).

Access many popular services, including Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play, HBO Now, and Apple TV+, to name a few, as well as free content via The Roku Channel and Tubi TV.

The iPhone giant laid out its blueprint on Sunday, announcing that it'll follow local health guidance in its reopening strategy. That means you'll have to wear a mask and follow other safety precautions if you want to enter the store.

Apple is starting with 25 locations across the U.S., which will reopen this week after being closed for 2 months. Some locations in Florida, Hawaii and California are among the first to reopen.

You can use Apple's Find a Store search tool to check on locations near you.

Every customer and employee is required to wear a face covering, Apple said in a note on its website. If a patron doesn’t have a face mask when they arrive, they will be given a free one by Apple before they are allowed to enter.

You'll also have to agree to a temperature check and may have to wait in line outside as the company curbs the number of people in its stores. Some locations will offer curbside pickup or storefront only.

Each retail location will undergo “enhanced deep cleanings” throughout the day in a bid to sanitize heavily touched services and cut down the risk of contagion. Apple warns that it could start to close its doors again if coronavirus cases start to spike or lockdown orders in certain areas are reenacted.

“Are you here for the haircut?’’ she asked.

He was, and so Harris, wearing an N95 face mask, handed sanitary wipes to the man, and led him to the makeshift barber's chairin the living room.

Soft music played in the background as a breeze kicked up and wind chimes jingled. The smell of citrus-scented candles and incense co-mingled as the customer, John Batinovich of Hollywood, settled into the barber's chair.

“You’ve got a great set up here,’’ he said.

It’s also illegal — and during the coronavirus pandemic, the hair industry is drawing legal scrutiny across the country.

In Texas, Shelley Luther was arrested after she defied an order to close her salon during the COVID-19 outbreak. She spent two days in jail and was fined $7,000.

In Michigan, Karl Manke's professional and business licenses were suspended after he refused to close his barbershop. Manke, 77, was charged with two criminal misdemeanors for defying the governor’s stay-at-home orders.

In California, the state has threatened disciplinary action against open salons and said it is investigating 651 related complaints. The city of Los Angeles has filed criminal complaints against four hair salons and one barbershop — along with 55 other businesses — that were open in violation of the city’s Safer at Home orders, Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer said last week.

Also last week, the Ulster County Department of Health and Mental Health in New York announced that a barber had tested positive for COVID-19 after cutting hair after the state put shutdown orders in place.

The number of hairstylists setting up shop at home or coloring and cutting hair at customers’ homes is on the rise as stay-at-home orders in states like California have stretched beyond eight weeks, more than a dozen hair stylists and industry experts told USA TODAY.

Financial pressure is cited as the chief reason hairstylists like Harris of Compton, California have put their cosmetology licenses at risk. Two weeks ago, Harris decided she had little choice.

“Do I take a chance and get turned into a criminal because I decided to work and pay my bills on time?’’ said Harris, 38. “Or do I just sit and watch my bills pile up, so when the economy does open up I’m thousands and thousands of dollars in debt?’’

There is no legal ambiguity in the state.

""California law requires that all services be performed in a licensed establishment,’’ Cheri Gyuro, public information officer for the California Department of Consumer Affairs, told USA TODAY. Similar laws are in effect in every other state, said Steve Sleeper, executive director of the Professional Beauty Association.

But the hairstylists and barbers are fighting to regain legal work opportunities during the pandemic.

Last week , The Center for American Liberty filed a federal lawsuit against California Gov. Gavin Newsom on behalf of the Professional Beauty Federation of California. It was an attempt to get hair salons reopened statewide.

5,000 miles away, stylists are worried

In Connecticut, Salon owner Odete DaSilva said she is among thousands of hairstylists and salon owners urging Gov. Ned Lamont to push back the May 20 date when salons and barbershops will be allowed to reopen. She said they fear the risks of getting infected with COVID-19 are too high to go back to work and allowing them to do so would end their ability to collect unemployment benefits.

“It’s such a divisive issue, right?’’ said Steve Sleeper, executive director of the Professional Beauty Association. “Our members are the same way that the rest of the country plays out. Half are thinking, ‘Hey, it’s too soon, let’s wait and make things safe.’ And the other half is, ‘Let’s go-go-go-go.’ “

The sense of urgency led one Southern California hairdresser to create in her garage a makeshift salon, complete with a hood dryer and a shampoo bowl. She spoke on the condition of anonymity because she said her cosmetology license could be revoked but allowed USA TODAY to take photos.

Upon arrival, the hairdresser said, her clients have been instructed to text her rather ring the doorbell to keep her two dogs from barking and eliminate unnecessary noise that might draw attention from neighbors.

The choice to defy or abide by state orders that govern the hair industry has become part of pandemic politics.

After Luther was released from a Dallas jail, Texas senator Ted Cruz got a haircut at her Salon à la Mode. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick announced he would pay Luther’s $7,000 fine, although the salon owner now has ample money to handle it.

She received more than $500,000 from a GoFundMe campaign that was started a day before she reopened her salon, and recently Luther started a nonprofit called “Courage to Stand.’’

On May 14, Luther told USA TODAY she was driving from to Michigan to offer support for Manke, the barber who is facing jail time after refusing to close his barbershop in Owosso, a town of about 15,000.

“My attorneys have been in touch with his attorneys,’’ said Luther, 46. “Even if it’s just showing my face, I need to go out there and support this man.

“Right now, I want to speak with actions and make sure everybody in the United States realizes that we’re getting our rights and freedoms taken away, and we need to take them back immediately.’’

Manke did not reply to interview requests.

'Everything is super clean'

In an interview at the small stucco house where she lives with two roommates, Harris did not speak about politics. But she spoke intently about health and safety, saying she recently completed two online courses and received COVID-19 certification from Barbicide, a company that sells products designed to clean and disinfect salons.

One of Harris’s roommates was helping her disinfect between customers.

“Everything is super clean,’’ Harris said of her makeshift salon.

But it’s unlikely the California State Board of Barbering and Cosmetology will be impressed based on warning it issued May 1 by social media.

“The Board urges licensees to follow the stay at home orders,’’ the post read. “If businesses continue to put public health and safety at risk by not following the guidance provided, and if circumstances warrant it, the Board may pursue disciplinary action against their license. This will not be taken lightly.’’

But last week, at the Sassoon Salon in Beverly Hills, the front door was open and a hairstylist was cutting a man’s hair. Neither were wearing a face mask. Susie Mutch, the global marketing director for Sassoon, did not respond to a request for comment.

In Brookhaven, Mississippi, Dedra Edwards said she's worried for hairstylists and barbers going back to work after her brother Eugene, a longtime barber, died of COVID-19 in April at the age of 46.

Dedra Edwards said her family thinks 46-year-old Eugene Edwards was infected with COVID-19 during a hair show in Jackson, Mississippi on March 15. Eugene Edwards was not wearing a face mask because the hair show was held before the state-at-home order was imposed, according to Dedra Edwards.

She said safety should be paramount as salons and barbershops reopen.

“I know they’re using masks,’’ Dedra Edwards said. “But you don’t know the client you’re working with, and you can carry COVID-19 and not have any symptoms.’’

Safety was part of the motivation when the Center for American Liberty filed the lawsuit on behalf of the PBFC, said attorney Fred Jones, counsel for the group representing the beauty and barbering industry.

“Tell me, what’s safer,” Jones said, “having (hairstylists and barbers) go from one kitchen to the next kitchen? Or having all of those ladies and men come into the controlled environment of the salon, where they maintain cross-contamination controls?''

After entering Harris’s home, Batinovich explained that he'd seen her on Craigslist, where a slew of hairstylists are advertising their services. The demand is high, several hairstylists told USA TODAY, and Harris said she averages between five and 10 customers per day.

She is charging $20 a haircut and making about as much as she does when she’s working at a Floyd’s 99 Barbershop.

Working with an electric razor, small comb and scissors, Harris needed about 20 minutes to complete Batinovich's haircut.

“You look good,’’ she said.

Batinovich smiled.

Penney says it plans to close more than a fourth of its stores.

According to a document filed with the Securities and Exchanges Commission on Monday, approximately 29% of the retailer's 846 stores, or 242 locations, will close between the current fiscal year and next fiscal year.

For the current fiscal year, which ends in February, 192 stores are expected to close, and then 50 in the next fiscal year, the document notes. After the closings, the company will have 604 locations.

“The approximately 604 future fleet represent the highest sales-generating, most profitable, and most productive stores in the network,” J.C. Penney said in the SEC filing.

J.C. Penney store closings coming:Retailer trying to avoid liquidation in Chapter 11 bankruptcy

Can these 13 retailers survive COVID-19:Permanent store closings, bankruptcies coming

Last week's bankruptcy filing came after several years of declining sales and strategic missteps as J.C. Penney careened from one reinvention strategy to another.

The bankruptcy sets in motion the process of permanent store closings as the retailer aims to stabilize its finances and avoid outright liquidation – a fate that chains such as Toys R Us, Payless ShoeSource and others haven't been able to avoid.

A list of which locations will close as part of J.C. Penney's restructuring has not been released.

According to the SEC filing, which outlines a “Plan for Renewal,” the exact number of stores that will remain “continues to evolve.”

J.C. Penney spokesperson Brooke Buchanan said approximately 115 more stores will reopen Wednesday after being closed since March because of COVID-19. Forty-one stores previously reopened.

Amazon and J.C. Penney in talks?

Amazon is reportedly in talks to acquire J.C. Penney, according to a report by Women's Wear Daily Monday.

""There is an Amazon team in Plano as we speak,"" WWD article notes, referencing the Texas city where J.C. Penney’s headquarters are located. ""There is a dialogue and I’m told it has a lot to do with Amazon eager to expand its apparel business.""

J.C. Penney declined to comment and Amazon officials did not immediately respond to USA TODAY’s request for comment Monday.

According to WWD, Amazon could convert J.C. Penney stores to its ""high-tech retail format"" and convert some sites into distribution centers.

It's hard out there. And, in this time of uncertainty, USA TODAY is working to find answers to your money questions – anything from stimulus checks or unemployment benefits to your 401(k) or retirement plans. You can submit your questions here and read earlier answers below.

We will be updating the Q&A, so check back often. But, also look to these places:

How long will I receive unemployment and how long will I receive the extra federal $600?

Answer: It depends on where you live. Workers in most states are eligible for up to 26 weeks of unemployment benefits from regular state-funded unemployment compensation, but some states allow for fewer weeks. Under a new federal law, you can receive an extra $600 per week from April 5, 2020 until July 31, 2020.

I was laid off only a week. Would I be eligible for the $600 federal unemployment bonus? If so, I never received it, how can I request it?

If you qualified for unemployment benefits in your state, you should be eligible for the extra $600 per week. Check with your local unemployment office.

Why is the status of the IRS Get My Payment tool listed as: 'No Payment Information is Available'?

... I filed my 2018 tax return and owed money. But I did not file my 2019 tax return. I fall within the income guidelines to receive a $1,200 check.

Ken Milani, professor of accountancy at the Mendoza College of Business at the University of Notre Dame, notes that the IRS doesn’t have the information it needs to make a direct deposit of the stimulus payment when you’ve owed money on that 2018 tax return. The IRS had a noon May 13 deadline to use Get My Payment at IRS.gov to supply direct deposit information.

How can I know if my direct deposit is right?

Everybody who receives a stimulus check will also get a letter from the IRS. The letter will tell you how much stimulus money you received and whether the money was sent by direct deposit or paper check. It also will explain how you can alert the IRS if anything needs to be corrected.

Will I get my CARES relief if the bank account on file with the IRS is closed and charged off?

I checked the IRS website to see where my payment is and it said it was deposited in that account.

Ken Milani, professor of accountancy at the Mendoza College of Business at the University of Notre Dame, suggests that you first contact the bank to see what happened there. If the bank has the money, be prepared to verify your identity. Most likely, the money may have been returned to the IRS.

The IRS states at its Economic Impact Payments Information Center, Question No. 33, that: “If the account is closed or no longer active, the bank will reject the deposit and you will be issued a check that will be mailed to the address we have on file for you. This is generally the address on your most recent tax return or as updated through the United States Postal Service (USPS). You do not need to call the IRS to change your Payment method or update your address at this time.”

In addition, the IRS states: “As required by law and for security reasons, a letter about the Payment will be mailed to each recipient’s last known address within 15 days after the Payment is made. The letter will provide information on how the Payment was made and how to report any failure to receive the Payment.”

I don't have the same bank account as I did in 2018. I was issued a stimulus check, minus back child support. Where is the remaining money and where will the IRS send it?

According to the IRS, if a stimulus check is sent to a recipient through direct deposit and the bank information is invalid or the bank account has been closed, the bank will reject the deposit. At that point, the IRS will mail the payment as soon as possible to the address they have on file for you, typically within 14 days. You can learn more about accessing your payment through the GetMyPayment page on the IRS web site.

I'm a health care worker. Can I qualify for unemployment if my coworker has tested positive for COVID-19 and I now fear working at the facility?

My coworker may have gotten Covid-19 from a patient at his second job. Because of this, I fear that I have been exposed to the virus and that if I continue to work at the facility, I will continue to be exposed.

Generally, you can only qualify for unemployment if you lost your job due to COVID-19, you’ve left your job to take care of family member who’s been infected, or you’re quarantining on the advice of a health-care provider and you’re unable to perform your duties. The U.S. Department of Labor recommends that if you believe your employer’s response to the possible spread of COVID-19 creates “a serious safety hazard” or if you think your employer is not following federal work safety standards, you can file a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

I file my taxes thru TurboTax and get refunds on a debit card. Will my stimulus funds be deposited to the card?

Like many things relating to the Economic Impact Payments, there does not appear to be a clear cut answer here. TurboTax said: “We are seeing some TurboTax customers who chose to receive their refund on a debit card get their stimulus payments to these accounts. Any TurboTax debit card customer who receives a stimulus payment from the IRS to that account, will receive that stimulus payment without delay or fees.”

At the same time, TurboTax recommends that people check the IRS Get My Payment tool to find out how they will receive their stimulus payment from the IRS and when.

TurboTax noted that the IRS is responsible for determining taxpayer eligibility of receiving a stimulus and, if a taxpayer is eligible, how and when the stimulus payments will be delivered to them.

The IRS is asking people to submit direct deposit information by noon May 13 at Get My Payment at IRS.gov before a steady flow of paper checks will be issued.

How exactly do you return a stimulus check that was sent to a dead person?

... A family member just received her stimulus benefit via direct deposit. Thing is, she’s been dead for three years. Are we required to give the money back?

Here's what the IRS said people need to do if they must return an Economic Impact Payment, such as one issued to a deceased person.

If the payment was a paper check:

Write ""Void"" in the endorsement section on the back of the check.

Mail the voided Treasury check immediately to the appropriate IRS location listed below.

Don't staple, bend, or paper clip the check.

Include a note stating the reason for returning the check.

And if you cashed that paper check already, or you received the stimulus money via direct deposit, the IRS said you should:

Submit a personal check, money order, etc., immediately to the appropriate IRS location listed at IRS.gov.

Write on the check/money order made payable to “U.S. Treasury” and write 2020EIP, and the taxpayer identification number (Social Security number, or individual taxpayer identification number) of the recipient of the check.

Include a brief explanation of the reason for returning the EIP.

The IRS could try to charge you interest and penalties at some point if you do not return the money.

I was claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return. Can I file my own 2019 return and receive stimulus check?

If you were claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return for 2019, you are out of luck for now. However, the stimulus payments are technically an advance credit on your 2020 taxes, so you could possibly claim the payment when you file your 2020 returns early next year, as long as someone else does not claim you as a dependent for 2020.

I was released from prison last year and have been trying to find a job. Do I qualify for any benefits under the new programs?

... The jobs I qualify for are considered nonessential and it's dangerous to be out trying to find work right now while taking care of my elderly brother. We are receiving food stamps.

You may be eligible for a stimulus payment once you file a 2019 tax return. Current inmates cannot get a payment, but ex-offenders can qualify, even if they have no income. If you do not file with the IRS right now, you could be eligible for the stimulus payment when you file a 2020 return next year.

You also may be eligible for unemployment benefits, including the additional $600 per week in enhanced benefits that the federal government has approved to help mitigate the financial impact of the coronavirus. Rules for unemployment benefits vary from state to state, but to qualify, you usually need to be actively looking for work and cannot turn down a job offer.

I haven't gotten my stimulus check. Can I still get one?

The first thing to check is if you qualify to receive a stimulus check under the CARES Act guidelines. If you do, it's important to remember that the government is sending out the payments in installments.

Payments were prioritized in order from lowest income to highest income.

For those with direct deposit information on file with the IRS, payments began going out on April 10. And last week to Social Security beneficiaries, railroad retirees and veterans who aren’t required to file a tax return, which will continue through May.

While the IRS started mailing checks in late April to those who qualify but do not have direct deposit information, that process might take several months.

What do I do if I get an error message when tracking my stimulus check?

The IRS updated its ""Get My Payment"" tool to fix some headaches. But some people continue to get error messages in some cases.

The IRS advises that you go back and check your most recent tax return or consider whether there is a different way to enter your street address (for example, 123 N Main St vs 123 North Main St).

""You may also verify how your address is formatted with the U.S. Postal Service by entering your address in the USPS ZIP Lookup tool, and then enter your address into Get My Payment exactly as it appears on file with USPS,"" the IRS said.

What is being discussed for the unemployed keeping heath care at a reasonable price?

If you had health coverage through your employer and lost your job, or if you received coverage as the dependent of someone who lost their job due to the pandemic, you could qualify for a special enrollment period to access the Affordable Care Act’s health exchange. If your lack of coverage is not related to the virus, then you have to wait until the fall to access the exchange. Regardless, anyone is eligible to receive a free COVID-19 test even if they’re not insured.

What if I did a paper return. How does that affect my stimulus?

Electronic filers are generally getting their money before those who mailed in their latest tax return because it’s easy to transfer the money to bank accounts they have on record. Regardless of how you filed, you can track your expected payment using the IRS Get My Payment tool. The timing of checks for those who filed paper returns last year is being complicated by the IRS' decision to stop processing paper returns due to COVID-19. That means there’s a delay not only in issuing checks but in determining how much you’re eligible to receive.

Situations like this will likely be handled on a case by case basis. Employers have, of course, the right to protest a claim. But states are encouraging employers to make accommodations for individuals with health risks, whether it’s allowing them to work from home or in a safe work environment. If that’s not possible, then such individuals could be eligible for unemployment insurance.

The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) does not require businesses to rehire the same people that were laid off. It only requires that the loan will be forgiven if at least 75% of the total amount is spent on personnel with the remainder on work-related costs, such as rent, mortgage or utilities. If you believe your boss has acted improperly or illegally, you could contact your local or state labor agency to file a complaint.

Different states may handle this situation differently. But it’s generally not the state’s desire to be punitive.

Would I be eligible for unemployment if I haven't had a job in 7 months? I had to quit to care for my mother. I'm currently looking for work.

How unemployment benefits are calculated varies by state, but even those who don’t qualify for unemployment are automatically considered for the new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program that was created as part of the CARES Act. PUA aids people who are unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic but do not qualify for traditional unemployment insurance. The PUA benefit rate is based on recent earnings, with recipients also getting the additional $600 per week.

I am the director of a small business whose employees were furloughed. With the extra $600 a week plus state unemployment benefits, several people will be earning more on unemployment than working.

Bringing staff back at their regular wage through the Paycheck Protection Program will result in them earning less than they are getting on unemployment. This doesn't seem right. Why would they return?

Several Republican senators brought up the very same issue during the debate on the first stimulus bill passed in March, saying it would encourage some people to collect unemployment rather than work. But both the Trump administration and most Democrats argued the $600 boost was necessary because unemployment benefits alone in many states would not restore their full pay before the crisis. They don’t believe most workers, such as front-line health care responders, would choose staying home over staying on the job.

Will my stimulus check be taxed?

No. Stimulus checks aren’t taxable income. The checks are refundable tax credits, according to the Tax Foundation, a tax policy think tank. The credits will be applied to 2020 tax returns, but are advanced to taxpayers now based on their 2019 or 2018 adjusted gross income.

After you file your taxes with a tax professional, transfer banks such as MetaBank, Republic Bank and Santa Barbara Tax Product Group set up temporary accounts for taxpayers who want a refund advance or to deduct tax preparation fees from a refund.

Will the additional $600 unemployment payment be taxable?

Yes. Unemployment benefits are considered taxable income, according to the IRS. Those benefits typically last for 26 weeks, but Congress added 13 additional weeks on top of that for a total of 39 weeks.

If your income is less in 2020, you will receive the difference of the credit if it is in your favor. If your income drops this year, for instance, you’ll be eligible for any remaining credit that you weren’t able to claim using your 2019 or 2018 return.

Will I get a stimulus check if I defaulted on my student loans?

Under the CARES Act, the government won’t withhold the money you owe for defaulted federal student loans out of your payment. It blocks the IRS from garnishing your tax refund for those late loan payments. Also, the government won't ding your wages or withhold social security payments for six months under the relief package.

... What if my tax refund was already garnished?

If your tax refund was withheld because you defaulted on a federal student loan on or after March 13, which was the day President Donald Trump declared a national emergency, it will be returned to you, according to the Department of Education. That also applies to garnished wages and withheld Social Security benefits.

... Does it apply to private loans?

No. Private debt collectors could still garnish student loan debts.

If you have trouble paying, contact your lender for options.

— Jessica Menton

Follow Jessica on Twitter @JessicaMenton.

Will my stimulus check be affected if I owe taxes?

... or child support?

... or overdue on student loan payments?

While the CARES Act suspends debts like overdue student loans or back taxes that typically lead to the garnishment of tax refunds, it doesn't apply to delinquent child support payments. That means the government's relief checks will still be garnished if you're overdue. And some spouses who are filing joint tax returns with their late-paying partners are upset their stimulus money is being trimmed or withheld, even if they typically qualify for relief in situations like tax refunds.

Even if your spouse is solely responsible for the debt, a shared tax refund or stimulus check could be at risk.

.... If I owe child support, does the stimulus money go to my ex?

The stimulus payment that is reduced or withheld by the child support owed will go to the appropriate collecting office for the taxpayer's state. From there, that collecting office will issue the money to the custodial parent, the person due the child support.

Small businesses (those with 500 and fewer employees) can apply for a loan under the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program that will cover eight weeks of operations and be fully forgiven if at least 75% of the money is used for payroll and the rest is for other other business-related expenses (such as rent/mortgage and utilities). You’ll have to download this form and then find an eligible lender, such as an SBA-certified local bank or commercial lender.

To receive forbearance through the CARES Act, you must contact your loan servicer. There won’t be any additional fees, penalties or interest added to your account through this deferment, but regular interest will still accrue.

Will adults with disabilities, who are dependents on a caregivers' tax returns, receive a stimulus check?

No. The new law that set up the stimulus check program says that individuals who are claimed as dependents by someone else are not eligible for a stimulus check.

Can I apply for unemployment benefits for a second, part-time job?

Losing a second job makes you eligible for partial unemployment insurance. States have different rules regarding part-time positions, but the federal CARES Act does say part-time workers who are affected by the ramifications of COVID-19 can get assistance. Check with your state, but you should be able to get some aid.

... I work 2 part time jobs, one of which I had my hours cut way back. I am still working about 20 hours a week in one job. Can I collect unemployment insurance on a part time job?

It depends on the state whether part-time workers can receive unemployment benefits. California for instance does pay out such funds. The federal CARES Act also says part-time workers are entitled to assistance if their hours are cut for reasons out of their control. So you may be able to get the $600 federal benefit as well, but again, it's best to check with your state unemployment office

When will the $600 federal unemployment check be paid?

... I got my first unemployment check but not the $600.

The pipeline for these payments is still unclear.

... I’ve been unemployed since January 2020. Is the $600 weekly benefit retroactive from then or just from the date it was announced?

Depending on when your state entered into an agreement with the federal government, the $600 weekly benefit could be retroactive back to March 28. It ends July 31.

... Are furloughs eligible for the federal $600?

Yes. If the person isn't being paid, they are considered unemployed and can receive that federal assistance.

My pay is based on commission, can I file for unemployment?

Specifically, if your hours have been cut or your office is closed for reasons related to COVID-19, you should be able to receive unemployment benefits. You would file in the state you work.

My unemployment expired already. Will I be eligible for any benefits now?

Yes. If you are still out of work, you should be eligible for the 13 weeks of unemployment benefits that the federal government will pay, along with the extra $600 federal payment per week.

... I've recently exhausted my unemployment about a month ago, but I'm not able to file online due to my initial claim.

A lot of websites are unfortunately still catching up with the additional benefits offered by the CARES Act. Reach out to your phone company to tell them your situation. You may be able to get a reprieve on your payment. And continue to call. The log jam will hopefully lessen as more staff is brought in.

Does a moratorium on rent mean I never have to pay rent for that month?

No, it just means the rent is deferred. That can leave tenants with several months of back payments due when the emergency is over.

What is unemployment insurance and how do I get it?

Unemployment insurance is a joint program between the federal government and the states set up to provide some money to people who are trying to get a job but can't find one. The benefit has been expanded by a $2.2 trillion relief package – called the CARES Act – passed by the federal government last week to help soften the blow of the coronavirus pandemic, which shutting down businesses across the country and forcing layoffs of millions of people.

""Every one of the 50 states has an online application system,"" says Michele Evermore, senior researcher and policy analyst for the National Employment Law Project.

How much unemployment will I get?

The maximum weekly benefit varies by state. For instance, in Florida, it tops out at $275, while in New York the maximum is $504. But under the federal relief law, everyone will get an additional $600 a week until July 31.

How long do unemployment benefits last?

Some states offer fewer weeks of benefits than others. But with unemployment now expanded, anyone who is still out of work when their state benefit period runs out will be able to get payments for an additional 13 weeks from the federal government.

Those who worked in states like Florida where the initial period is only 12 weeks, would be eligible for the unemployment insurance specifically pegged to the pandemic which tacks on another 14 weeks.

Through these various steps, all those who are out of work will be able to get assistance for up to 39 weeks.

How much stimulus money can I get?

If you've already filed your 2019 taxes, the Internal Revenue Service will use those returns to determine your payment. If not, your 2018 returns will be used to calculate your check.

Individuals with an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less will be eligible for a one-time payment of up to $1,200 ($2,400 for joint tax returns) and $500 for each qualifying child. Those with little or no tax liability also will get $1,200 ($2,400 for joint returns).

The payments will start to phase out for Americans who earn more than $75,000, or $150,000 for a joint return. The amount you receive will be decreased by 5% of the amount your income exceeds $75,000.

You can use this calculator to estimate your check amount.

Special to USA TODAY

Johnny C. Taylor Jr., a human resources expert, tackles your questions as part of a series for USA TODAY. Taylor is president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, the world's largest HR professional society.

The questions are submitted by readers, and Taylor's answers have been edited for length and clarity.

Have a question? Do you have an HR or work-related question you’d like me to answer? Submit it here.

Question: I have been working from home for about a month now due to the coronavirus. It was fine at first, but I’m beginning to feel disconnected from my work and my team. How can I ensure my colleagues and I remain on the same page? Unfortunately, things are not business as usual around here. – Anonymous

Answer: I’m sorry to hear you feel disconnected. Telework is certainly not ideal for everyone – especially when it’s effectively mandated, rather than freely chosen.

If it’s any consolation, you’re not alone in your remote work difficulties. Forty-one percent of U.S. employees feel burnt out from work during this pandemic as many find themselves working longer hours and struggling to stay connected with colleagues.

In fact, it’s likely your boss is struggling with the same problem – albeit from a different perspective: 65% of employers say maintaining employee morale has been a challenge.

Here’s my advice for you: Communicate, communicate, communicate.

If you think your team is desynchronized, be sure to let your boss know. Tackling this could mean scheduling weekly meetings to discuss projects, housekeeping items or even simple check-ins. Or there may be a better way to share information by centralizing and organizing the tasks and projects you’re collaborating on.

Missing workplace banter and face-to-face interaction? Set up a video call with a co-worker and ask how he or she manages remote work. Odds are, that person may feel disconnected, too, and will be happy to hear from you – and might be able to share some remote work tips. You could even start a group instant message about recommended TV shows, books and movies to enjoy during downtime under lockdown.

Believe me, I understand the difficulties. But as a radical optimist, I can’t help but see the silver lining.

Though we may be more isolated, we’re not alone – the struggle is shared by us all. The teams that see that and come together to create connection won’t merely survive this crisis. They’ll come out the other side better because of it.

Stay strong!

Q: Can you be fired for not getting the flu shot or other vaccinations? – Anonymous

A: I get this question a lot lately because the whole world is searching for a COVID-19 vaccine and employers want to know whether they can mandate their employers take it once it's available. The answer is complicated, so bear with me.

Generally speaking, the answer is yes. Your employer can require or mandate a vaccine as a term and condition of employment.

For decades, health care and education employers have required employees to take the flu shot and show proof of other major vaccinations – such as those for tetanus, polio or measles – since they are in close contact with vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly and immunocompromised people.

I predict, because of the damage COVID-19 has done to lives and livelihoods, we will see many more employers in other sectors make this a requirement.

There are exemptions under federal and certain state laws protecting the rights of people who wish not to be vaccinated. These exceptions require more than an employee stating a generalized belief that vaccines may be harmful. Some exemptions pertain to religious or philosophical views, though there are also medical reasons – such as an underlying condition – that could put certain vaccines out of the question.

You didn’t mention whether you are personally concerned about required vaccines. If you are, and your job requires vaccination, you will need to have a conversation with your employer about your refusal, your reasoning and whether an accommodation can be made.",100,High,Center,USA,1

Already almost 4 million homeowners were on forbearance plans as of May 3, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act — or CARES Act — provides borrowers with home loans the right to request a temporary suspension of payments on federally backed mortgages.

Forbearance is a temporary fix but it may be worth exploring in order to avoid a foreclosure down the road.

In March, lenders might have initially offered to let homeowners who made such requests to postpone 90 days of mortgage payments through a forbearance agreement. Many of those agreements, though, would likely expire come late June or July.

Consumers can see their payments paused for up to six months initially and possibly another six months.

The debt isn't forgiven and the regular interest keeps building. No additional fees can be charged.

“Forbearance is really a deferral. They will still need to make these payments,” said Kathleen L. Kraninger, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in phone call Friday morning.

Some early requests triggered a great deal of confusion and frustration, though, when some homeowners were told by some mortgage servicers that they'd be required to repay the money in a lump sum when the three months were up.

But that's not your only option.

A new Consumer Relief Guide, which spells out the relief process associated with federally backed mortgages, was released Friday by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. The guide outlines the rights to mortgage payment forbearance and foreclosure protection under the federal CARES Act.

See www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus for information on how to protect your finances during the coronavirus pandemic.

Such relief is essential as 36.5 million workers across the country have applied for unemployment benefits in the past eight weeks.

Much of the U.S. economy has been put on pause in an attempt to save lives during the coronavirus crisis. In the coming weeks, parts of the economy are expected to gradually reopen. Some workers may return to their jobs soon; others won't.

John W. Ryan, president and CEO of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, said borrowers are telling state regulators that they're confused about mortgage relief, and in some cases, getting inconsistent information about forbearance.

Consumers have a right to get up to 180 days of forbearance initially, and then request an extension for up to another 180 days of payment relief.

The consumer relief guide gives a summary of borrowers’ rights under the CARES Act, steps to access mortgage relief and repayment options.

Many lenders and servicers are providing forbearance benefits regardless of federally backed status, according to the Consumer Relief Guide.

Kraninger said the CFPB is working hand-in hand with other federal and state regulators to protect consumers during this national emergency.

The guide notes:

Homeowners have the right to obtain a 180-day pause in paying your mortgage or temporarily lower mortgage payments if you are a borrower on a federally backed mortgage loan and affirm that you are experiencing a financial hardship due directly or indirectly to the COVID-19 emergency.

Your mortgage servicer — or company where you send payments to each month — can tell you if your loan is federally backed.

While in forbearance, you can still choose to make partial payments, which will reduce the amount you would need to repay in the future.

In most cases, you should receive multiple options for repaying the monthly payments that were not made during the forbearance period.

Foreclosure actions on loans federally backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and HUD, which includes single family FHA loans and reverse mortgage HECM loans, are frozen until June 30, 2020.

Loan types that are federally backed include: Conventional loans purchased or securitized by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

The NAR's quarterly report on metro home prices shows that the median single-family home price increased year over year in 96% of U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2020, versus 94% in the first quarter of 2019.

Further, home prices for the first quarter of 2020 sat at $274,600, an increase of 7.7% from the same period in 2019. Forty-six metros, particularly in Western and Southern markets, saw price jumps of double digits, including Boise City, Idaho (18.1%), Eugene, Oregon (14.5%), and Colorado Springs, Colorado (14.4%).

The NAR report shows that all regional median single-family sales prices rose when compared to 2019: Northeast (9.7%), Midwest (7.5%), South (7.5%), and West (7.5%).

NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun noted: ""The first quarter price jumps mostly reflect conditions prior to the coronavirus outbreak and show the strength of the housing demand prior to the pandemic. Even now, due to very limited listings, home prices are showing no signs of buckling.""

So why are home prices holding steady? Real estate is a lagging economic indicator, meaning a slowdown in home price growth will likely be prolonged over the next several quarters and years. And we've seen years of tight supply across most U.S. markets, which will help buoy prices.

""Supply is extremely limited, and there are simply not as many homes for sale to meet the demand among potential buyers,"" Yun said. ""More supply and more listings are needed to provide a faster recovery for the economy.""

Couple low supply with low interest rates, and demand for housing is looking as though it will remain strong in the short term, keeping prices stable. By the fourth quarter of 2019, NAR reports that there were 1.5 million homes available for sale, which was 10% less than the beginning of 2019.

The Motley Fool

COVID-19 isn't just wreaking havoc on Americans' near-term finances; it's also putting their long-term financial security at risk. Not only have retirement plan values plunged since the pandemic took hold, but those who are out of work are likely pausing retirement plan contributions until their income picks back up.

If you're worried that COVID-19 will force you to delay retirement, you're not alone. But here are a few things you can do to avoid that fate.

1. Leave your existing savings alone

Passed back in March, the CARES Act was put into effect to help Americans stay afloat during this difficult time. One provision of the CARES Act is that you're now allowed to withdraw up to $100,000 from an IRA or 401(k) penalty-free, regardless of age. Normally, withdrawals are subject to a 10% penalty when they're taken prior to age 59 1/2.

Tapping your retirement savings may be tempting when you're grappling with a hit to your income. But before you go that route, try exploring other options. If you're out of work, the companies you owe money to (like your mortgage lender, auto loan servicer, and utility providers) may agree to let you defer payments for a number of months, and that could make it possible to leave your IRA or 401(k) intact. That's important, because withdrawing from your retirement savings right now, when the market is down, increases your chances of locking in losses. It also leaves you with less money on hand when you're older, which could result in a scenario where you're forced to delay retirement.

2. Keep funding your retirement plan if you're able to

If you've lost your job and are living on unemployment benefits right now, contributing to a retirement plan may not be possible. But if you still have an income and there's money left over after your basic needs are tended to, then it pays to put that cash into your retirement plan.

First of all, the more you contribute to a traditional IRA or 401(k), the more you lower your tax burden for the year. Secondly, now's a good time to pump money into a retirement plan because a lot of investments can still be snatched up on the relative cheap. Finally, maintaining your contributions will help you stay on course savings-wise, which is the ticket to getting to retire when you want to.

3. Borrow smartly as needed to avoid high-interest debt

You may reach a point in the coming weeks or months when you need to borrow money to pay your bills. And borrowing in the form of racking up a credit card balance may be the easiest way to go – but it's by no means the most affordable way to go. Credit cards tend to charge exorbitantly high interest, which means that once you accrue that type of debt, you're apt to spend so much money paying it off that there may not be enough left over to fund your retirement savings when things get better.

Rather than borrow via credit card debt, try borrowing against your home. You'll generally pay a lot less interest on a home equity loan or line of credit. If you're not a homeowner, a personal loan is a better bet than credit card debt. You stand a good chance of snagging one provided your credit score is strong.

The COVID-19 crisis is ruining a lot of people's retirement plans, but it doesn't have to wreck yours. If you leave your existing savings alone, keep funding your IRA or 401(k), and avoid high-interest debt, there's a good chance you'll manage to stick to your target retirement date despite the many obstacles that may now be in your way.

The COVID-19 crisis has done extensive damage to the U.S. economy already, and the longer it drags on, the tougher our recovery is apt to be. But as difficult as things have been for individuals, the companies that employ them have been thrust into a very tricky set of circumstances, too.

The good news? Most workers are pleased with the way their employers have handled things in light of COVID-19, according to a recent survey by Workfest powered by Zenefits, an HR software company. Specifically, 67% of employees believe their employers genuinely care about their well-being and have taken steps to make that clear during the pandemic. And 74% think their employers took the right precautions to ensure employee safety during the crisis.

A big part of protecting employees boils down to clear communication, and in this regard, 68% of employees agree that their employers have stepped up. But despite all of this positive news, workers remain concerned about their jobs.

Specifically, 51% of employees surveyed are anxious about their employment status given the state of the economy. And about half of workers think that the companies they work for won't last longer than three months without some type of financial assistance, or without the economy being able to open back up.

If you're worried about losing your job in the course of the ongoing crisis, you're clearly not alone. Here are four steps to take if that's a major concern.

1. Talk to your employer

Your employer may have more financial reserves than you'd expect. Before you spend sleepless nights worrying about a potential layoff, have an honest conversation with your boss. Express that you're concerned about losing your job and ask for a realistic view of where things stand in that regard. Your boss may tell you that your department is last on the chopping block, which could help you breathe easier. Or you may learn that your worries are legitimate, in which case having that knowledge can help you prepare for a layoff accordingly.

2. Assess your savings

Part of the reason so many Americans are struggling financially right now is that they don't have cash reserves in the bank. But if you have a healthy level of emergency savings, you may be in a stronger position to ride out a layoff should that come to be. Look at your savings balance and compare it to what your expenses entail. You may get some peace of mind if you see that you can easily cover three or four months' worth of bills without having to resort to a backup plan.

3. Read up on unemployment benefits

Generally speaking, you're entitled to unemployment benefits if you lose your job through no fault of your own. These days, unemployment benefits are more generous than they've been in the past. As part of the COVID-19 relief package that was passed in March, you're now entitled to an extra $600 a week in addition to your regular unemployment benefit. This holds true even if that $600 boost results in a raise. Unemployment has also been extended by 13 weeks, which means you may be entitled to up to 39 weeks of benefits.

4. Figure out what you'll do about health insurance

You may have a decent chunk of cash in emergency savings, and you may be entitled to a respectable unemployment benefit should your job be taken away. But what about health insurance? At a time like this, you can't afford to not have coverage, so spend some time researching your options. You may be able to retain your existing insurance, albeit at a cost. Or your employer may agree to extend your coverage for a while and subsidize your premiums. It's certainly worth having that conversation.

Though it's encouraging to see that most employees think their employers have handled the ongoing crisis well, that doesn't negate the fear of losing their jobs. If you're worried about layoffs, take the above steps. The more information you gather, the more empowered you'll feel at a time when so much uncertainty abounds.
