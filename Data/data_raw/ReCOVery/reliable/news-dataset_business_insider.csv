We spoke to Dr. Susan Hassig, an epidemiologist at Tulane University, to find out which activities are not too risky, and which you should try to avoid.

Gatherings with groups of friends or family are risky, Hassig said.

Catching the virus from opening mail or touching groceries is unlikely, she said.

Coronavirus transmission is not black and white — some activities are riskier than others, while some should cause little worry.

As states start to reopen parts of their economies and people tire of an all-out quarantine, the risk level of various activities should be considered to make decisions about what's safe and what should be avoided.

Harvard Medical School professor Julia Marcus recently argued in The Atlantic that we should remember risk is not binary, and an abstinence-only approach — like that used in some sex education — won't help. ""Likewise, asking Americans to abstain from nearly all in-person social contact will not hold the coronavirus at bay — at least not forever,"" she wrote.

So we spoke to Dr. Susan Hassig, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in New Orleans, about the risk of going out to eat, gathering with friends, or opening mail.

While different activities are riskier than others by nature, you should always wear a mask when possible and try to keep a distance of 6 feet from others.

Actions like social distancing and wearing a mask (or the lack thereof) can alter risk level significantly.

In many countries, limited testing capacity and the difficulty of finding and identifying asymptomatic cases has likely caused many patients to go undiagnosed. COVID-19 tests can also produce false negatives if they aren't administered properly or if a patient isn't shedding enough virus to be detected in a sample.

Some public-health experts have suggested that the actual case totals in Italy and the US could be at least 10 times higher than the current figures. Death counts are likely to be inaccurately low as well.

""There are a lot of deaths that we probably will never know if they were coronavirus deaths or not,"" Elizabeth Halloran, a biostatistician at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, told Business Insider. ""There could be a lot more people infected than we thought.""

Data from the Italian research group Istituto Cattaneo now suggests that the number of coronavirus deaths in Italy was almost double the total reported by the Italian Department of Civil Protection as of April 1.

Data from the US is less complete, but many states have reported spikes in excess deaths that have yet to be attributed to the virus, suggesting that the actual number of coronavirus deaths could be around 30% higher. In some states, total fatalities could be twice the current count.

Italian provinces substantially underreported their outbreaks

To quantify the true number of fatalities in Italy, the Istituto Cattaneo compared the number of reported deaths from February 21 to March 21 to the average number of deaths during that same time period from 2015 to 2019.

According to data from the Italian Department of Civil Protection, Italy saw around 4,800 coronavirus deaths across more than 1,000 municipalities from February to March. But in total, these municipalities recorded 8,700 deaths outside the normal average — meaning thousands of excess deaths have yet to be explained.

In Lombardy, the northern region where Italy's first case was reported, the number of recorded deaths was more than double the average from the past five years. A case study from the Institute of Public Health Berlin and the Italian healthcare network Centro Medico Santagostino corroborates that finding. The research found that only half the deaths reported in Nembro — a municipality in Lombardy — from February 21 to April 11 were categorized as COVID-19 deaths. Yet in March, the municipality saw more deaths than in any single year since 2012; the death count that month was 15 times higher than the monthly average between January 2012 and February 2020.

""Reporting of confirmed COVID-19 specific deaths represents, at least for some Italian regions, a substantial underestimation of the actual number of deaths from the disease,"" the researchers wrote.

Other northern regions, like Emilia-Romagna, Trentino-Alto Adige, and Piedmont, saw their death counts rise by more than 50%, the Istituto Cattaneo found.

Even southern regions outside the epicenter of Italy's crisis saw higher-than-average death counts from February to March. The researchers said one explanation for this could be that many coronavirus deaths occurred in people's homes, and therefore weren't included in the official case counts.

""The impact of coronavirus has spread widely across the Italian population,"" they wrote. ""Substantial increases in mortality are also visible in areas other than those traditionally indicated as coronavirus hotspots.""

The study ultimately concluded that Italy's true coronavirus death toll is nearly double the reported one. Officially, more than 31,000 people have died of COVID-19 in Italy.

US states reported an excess of unexplained deaths this spring

Though it's possible for some flu deaths to be mistakenly identified as the coronavirus, researchers at Harvard and Emory Universities found that the coronavirus has been far deadlier than the flu in terms of reported cases so far. In a new study, they compared the weekly death count for the coronavirus to weekly death counts for seasonal influenza in the US.

""Although officials may say that SARS-CoV-2 is 'just another flu,' this is not true,"" the researchers wrote. ""The demand on hospital resources during the COVID-19 crisis has not occurred before in the US, even during the worst of influenza seasons.""

During the week ending April 21, the study found, the number of reported coronavirus deaths was 20 times higher than influenza deaths reported during the deadliest week of flu season (over a seven-year average). Based on this analysis, the researchers concluded that the current number of COVID-19 deaths might ""substantially understate"" the actual number of fatalities.

""As the CDC continues to revise its COVID-19 counts to account for delays in reporting, the ratio of counted COVID-19 deaths to influenza deaths is likely to increase,"" they wrote.

Across many states, the number of reported coronavirus deaths from mid-March through mid-April exceeded the number of typically recorded deaths from all causes during that time frame, a New York Times analysis recently found. Data from 25 states suggests only 40,000 of 55,000 excess deaths have been attributed to the coronavirus so far.

In New Jersey, only half of the excess deaths have been attributed to the coronavirus, suggesting that actual COVID-19 fatalities could be twice as high. The same goes for Colorado, Michigan, and Virginia.

His donations have ranged across a number of causes from stopping domestic violence, to giving equal access to the internet for students.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced last month that he was donating $1 billion of his Square equity to COVID-19 relief, and so far he's dispersed over $87 million.

Dorsey created a new charity fund called Start Small LLC, which will initially focus on relief efforts to help with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Dorsey estimated that the fund is around 28% of his total wealth.

The Twitter CEO released a spreadsheet, which so far only shows $73 million in donations, accounting for how much and to where donations are being made. According to the spreadsheet, Dorsey has made contributions to organizations tackling domestic violence due to the pandemic, HIV/AIDS, refugees, advocacy for prisoners, among many others.

However, in a tweet, Dorsey added that there are several initiatives that have not been added to the spreadsheet yet.

Dorsey has so far donated over $1.3 million to two organizations that will screen for HIV as well as address how the current pandemic is impacting HIV in marginalized communities.

""Funds will support the Elton John AIDS Foundation (EJAF) COVID-19 Emergency Fund to support EJAF frontline partners to respond to the pandemic and its' effects on HIV prevention and care for the most marginalized communities,"" Dorsey's spreadsheet wrote.

Experts have worried efforts to limit the spread of and treat infectious diseases like HIV could be significantly reduced due to the pandemic.

Tolbert Nyenswah, a research associate at Johns Hopkins University, previously told Business Insider that in countries where patients rely on clinics for medication, a lack of personal protective equipment means entire facilities that many rely on could be shut down if one hospital worker gets sicks.

That leaves people dealing with infectious diseases at risk. ""This will have longtime consequences for decades to come,"" Nyenswah said

Domestic violence has also increased as more people were sheltering in place. Business Insider previously reported that calls to hotlines in major cities increased during the lockdown. Dorsey is funding multiple initiatives to address the concern totaling more than $2.2 million.

He's also invested in organizations that provide necessary food for people in need, providing support for the homeless, mental health initiatives, as well as $10 million into the Oakland School Fund to close the educational gap between students who don't access to the internet and those who do.

According to The San Francisco Chronicle, officials in Oakland launched the initiative on Thursday to raise $12.5 million for 25,000 laptops and internet hotspots to families in the city. In a tweet Dorsey' wrote that he saw the initiative and funded it ""immediately.""

""$10mm to give EVERY single child in Oakland access to a laptop and internet in their homes, closing the digital divide,"" he wrote on Twitter.

The Chronicle added that 50,000 students in the cities public school system ""are disconnected or under-connected from technology at home.""

In a new study, researchers created a model that uses a trio of biological markers to predict whether a patient was likely to die from COVID-19.

The model was able to forecast the death of individual patients more than 10 days in advance with at least 90% accuracy.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Doctors are struggling to identify which coronavirus patients will develop severe cases that require hospitalization and put them at risk of death.

Newly published research may offer a way to accurately predict a patient's risk of dying from COVID-19. The authors of a study published Thursday in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence created a model that looks at three biological markers — which can be measured in a drop of blood — that can indicate whether a patient's case might get dangerously severe more than 10 days ahead of time, with at least 90% accuracy.

Taken together, these three clues could ""play a crucial role in distinguishing the vast majority of cases that require immediate medical attention,"" the authors wrote, adding that their model ""provides a simple and intuitive clinical test to precisely and quickly quantify the risk of death.""

A trio of indicators that suggest a higher risk of death

In Wuhan, China, research shows 14%-19% of infected patients became severely sick. Among those critically ill cases, the death rate was higher than 60%.

To identify commonalities between these severe cases, the researchers analyzed blood samples taken repeatedly from 485 coronavirus patients at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 10 and February 18. They tested for myriad kidney, heart, and blood-clotting issues, noted whether those patients had survived or died, then used machine-learning algorithms to look for biological patterns.

The results found that the following indicators can predict whether a patient had a higher risk of death than other infected people:

High levels of the enzyme lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). This is associated with lung damage and the type of tissue breakdown that happens during pneumonia. Lymphopenia, the term for low levels of lymphocytes — white blood cells that defend the body against invading pathogens. An increase in high-sensitivity C-reactive proteins, or hs-CRP for short. This indicates inflammation in the lungs.

Using those indicators, the computer model could predict what happened to the hospital patients 10 days in advance of their clinical outcomes.

""The three key features, LDH, lymphocytes and hs-CRP, can be easily collected in any hospital,"" the researchers wrote in the study. ""In crowded hospitals, and with shortages of medical resources, this simple model can help to quickly prioritize patients, especially during a pandemic when limited healthcare resources have to be allocated.""

A coronavirus 'risk score'

Another study published this week took a similar approach, pinpointing 10 biomarkers that can help doctors assess individual patients' risk levels. That research, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Tuesday, suggested using these markers to determine the likelihood that a hospitalized COVID-19 patient will become critically ill — admitted to an intensive-care unit or put on a ventilator — or die.

The researchers retrospectively examined medical records from 1,590 patients who were treated in 575 hospitals across China between November 21, 2019 and January 31.

Two of those biomarkers overlap with those suggested in the Nature study: high levels of LDH and a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (which is associated with lower levels of lymphocytes).

The other eight risk predictors include a history of cancer, high number of preexisting medical conditions, older age, shortness of breath, coughing up blood, unconsciousness, abnormal chest X-rays, and high levels of bilirubin (a substance in the blood that, in elevated amounts, indicates liver damage).

The researchers used those 10 indicators to develop an online coronavirus risk ""calculator"" that could help predict which hospitalized COVID-19 patients will become critically ill.

That prediction tool could enable doctors and healthcare workers optimize hospital resources, the study authors wrote.

""If the patient's estimated risk for critical illness is low, the clinician may choose to monitor, whereas high-risk estimates might support aggressive treatment or admission to the ICU,"" they said.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

Some states, like Texas, have already seen a surge in new cases.

But it's still too early to draw definitive conclusions about the effects of loosened restrictions, since data on confirmed cases and deaths lags behind the on-the-ground reality.

These interactive charts show how many new COVID-19 cases are being reported daily in 20 states.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Across the US, 30 states have relaxed aspects of their stay-at-home orders and allowed certain businesses to reopen, hoping the worst is behind them. Meanwhile, 18 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam remain under lockdown.

Public-health experts have repeatedly warned that lifting lockdowns too early could lead to more waves of coronavirus transmission, which could force states to implement new lockdowns to curb the virus' spread.

Some states have already seen cases spike. Less than two weeks after its stay-at-home order expired, Texas reported its largest daily increase in new coronavirus cases and deaths. Others states, including Florida and Georgia, eased restrictions in recent weeks even though case numbers weren't declining, but have seen them hold relatively stable so far. States like New York and Washington, where outbreaks hit earlier and lockdowns are still in effect, have reported steady declines in new cases.

However, we don't yet have definitive answers as to how states' decisions to loosen restrictions are impacting their outbreaks. That's because new case data can lag several weeks behind what's actually happening — people who get COVID-19 take an average of five days to develop symptoms, then may need to wait multiple days for test results. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has estimated that numbers we see today reflect infections that occurred about two weeks ago.

In states that aren't doing extensive testing, many cases might also not show on public health officials' radars at all.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the US, a select group of brick and mortar retailers was defying the retail apocalypse and reporting quarter after quarter of strong sales growth, proving that stores still had a place in an increasingly digital world.

While other brick and mortar chains crumbled as Amazon and e-commerce, in general, became more dominant forces, these select stores found a way around to compete by offering an experience that couldn't easily be replicated online. This meant that many of them either didn't need to have an online store at all or at best, only needed to offer a very minimal e-commerce experience for their customers.

TJ Maxx, Ross Stores, Primark, Dollar General, and Dollar Tree are among the retailers who fit into this category. These stores are using deals and discounts and the thrill of a treasure hunt shopping experience to keep customers coming back.

As soon as the pandemic hit, their situation drastically changed, however. Many of these retailers, which had relied almost entirely on in-store sales, saw business dry up almost overnight thanks to enforced store closings and having a limited online offering, or none at all, to fall back on.

In the short term, this has meant an immediate hit on sales but analysts say even as stores begin to reopen, it is the long-term impact of the pandemic that these retailers should be concerned about as it could result in a permanent change in how consumers shop.

Some shoppers might be too scared to go back to stores and will switch to digital options for good, and the lack of any vaccine for COVID-19 means that there is a high chance of a second wave of infection, putting any store without a strong online presence at greater risk in the future.

The narrative has changed

In the past, off-price stores and dollar chains had defended their lack of a strong online presence by highlighting the simplicity of their business model.

""There was some justification in this because online selling adds complexity and cost and can erode margins. The continuous positive results from players like Primark and TJX [the parent company of TJ Maxx] justified their positions,"" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said in an email to Business Insider.

But ""the coronavirus crisis has changed much of this narrative,"" he said. ""In the short term, not being able to transact online has severely damaged brands without an online presence. Their sales have simply faded away and there is no means by which they can capture some of the demand that still exists. Potential customers have also diverted to competitors,"" and ""given the risk of a second wave or even a future pandemic, many of them will likely review their e-commerce needs.""

Photos of lines outside TJ Maxx stores as they reopened in the US this week indicate that some shoppers are more than happy to resume their old shopping ways. But analysts say this won't be true of everyone, and while there might be a short-term burst after weeks of lockdown, many customers will continue to be cautious and avoid stores. If a second wave of infection was to hit later on, and stores were closed again, these retailers are back to square one.

A recent survey conducted by investment bank Jefferies of 500 female shoppers, who had previously shopped at a TJ Maxx or Marshalls store, found that 60% said they would make some change to the percentage of their spending done in stores once stay-at-home restrictions are lifted; 28% said they would spend more on apparel online initially after stores reopened, and around 60% said they would avoid trying on clothes in stores after COVID-19.

Doug Stephens, retail industry expert and founder of website Retail Prophet, said that until we find a vaccine for coronavirus or achieve some level of herd immunity that is long-lasting, we should not expect to return to ""the normal retail landscape"" anytime soon.

""Let's think about the people that are 45-50 and over,"" he said in a recent conversation with Business Insider. ""They are the highest risk group, and if nothing else they are going to be saying to themselves every time they have a need to go to a store: 'Do I really need to go to a store where I am potentially going to have to wear face coverings, be socially distanced, wait in line to get in, wear gloves, use hand sanitizer, or could I just order this online?'

""I really think it is going to come down to that,"" he said.

Retailers without an e-commerce offering risk becoming irrelevant

The pandemic has meant that many more shoppers are testing online services than otherwise would have, becoming more comfortable with this option and possibly more loyal to it. This, in turn, puts extra pressure on those retailers that don't offer e-commerce services and makes them more at risk of becoming ""irrelevant,"" experts say.

""It's certainly possible they will survive,"" Calvin Carter CEO and founder of digital consultancy agency Bottle Rocket, said in an email to Business Insider, referring to these chains with no online stores or with significantly scaled back e-commerce services. ""But they will be irrelevant, which is the beginning of the end for any company in any industry. When you no longer meet your customers where they are and center your offerings around their needs, you immediately become both irrelevant and at risk of disruption from competitors.""

Not all of the e-commerce free or e-commerce light chains are so vulnerable, however, he said. While consumers might look to avoid busy malls and high traffic areas, Carter said that stores in rural areas, for example, are likely to suffer less. This could put a chain such as Dollar General, which mostly has stores in suburban and rural areas, in a stronger position. Dollar General has operated an online store since 2011.

A business model that doesn't lend itself well to e-commerce

For many of these stores, part of the appeal and the reason that they have been able to stave off the threat of Amazon and other e-commerce players for so long is that they offer a shopping experience that is hard to replicate online, which means their business model simply doesn't lend itself well to e-commerce.

In the case of off-price stores and dollar chains, it's the treasure hunt shopping experience and the idea that you won't know what kind of bargains you'll find until you get to the store that keeps customers coming back. Once in the store, these retailers bank on customers spending more than they might have planned; the margins on each item are slim but they make money from customers buying in large quantities.

Meanwhile, as online consumers ""tend to behave substantially more rationally, it is hard to fully replicate the essence of the shopping trip"" online,"" UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School Professor Katrijn Gielens told Business Insider.

There are ways around this, however. Carter suggests that TJ Maxx, or an off-price store of that kind, could consider having digital personal shoppers that help customers to discover items in new ways online, thereby replicating the treasure hunt experience.

Off-price stores also face a separate challenge: the designer brands that they stock generally don't want customers to be able to find deals and discounts on their products online as it devalues the brand.

TJ Maxx, which launched its online store in 2013, circumvents this issue by making it impossible for its customers to search by a brand on its site. But while this might keep vendors happy, it doesn't necessarily make for a slick online shopping experience. Both TJ Maxx and Marshalls reopened their websites this week with a cap on the number of daily orders, provoking a backlash among customers.

Gielens said that rather than use their websites for transactions, these stores could also look at how they could become digital versions of showrooms to give customers a better idea of what they might expect to see in stores to encourage any reticent shoppers that it is well worth their while to make a visit to that store.

""The opposite of showrooming, webrooming, is occurring more and more. Even when you do not necessarily want to push your consumers online, by offering insight into what you have to offer you can persuade them to visit the store,"" she said.

The cost of offering e-commerce services is a major factor for most of these retailers and in some cases, adding this option may ""destroy the very essence of their business model,"" Gielens said. If not carefully implemented, it could completely undermine their reason for their existence, she added.

At some low-cost chains, the cost of shipping and fulfilling the order of an individual item might even exceed the price of that item, making it near impossible to make money from this.

Gielens said these retailers really have two options: to double down on their competitive differentiation, i.e. not having an online store and work hard to keep giving customers a reason to visit (which would also mean making changes to make the shopping experience safer), or to invest in digital options and ""reluctantly admit that they must approach it [retail] in a new and different way.""",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

The peak of its outbreak — the period marked by the highest numbers of new daily infections — came between March 26 and April 3, during which it maintained a death rate far below the likes of Spain and Italy.

As Business Insider reported in late March, this was attributed to an early lockdown, swift mass-testing drive, a well-oiled healthcare system, and clear government messaging.

Seven weeks on — as the country starts to reopen — not much has changed.

The reproduction number (R) — which indicates how many people the average person infects, and indicates how fast the virus is spreading — has wholly remained below 1, but for one surge from 0.65 to 1.1 last weekend.

But the country weathered the storm with minimal fuss, and its R rate subsided to 0.8 by Wednesday.

Authorities said the surge was caused by outbreaks in a few nursing homes and a factory. North Rhine-Westphalia, where the factory was located, reacted by briefly reimposing lockdown, it ended on Friday.

""If one compares the German death rate with that of other countries, it becomes clear that the number of deaths in Germany has not increased as much as one might have feared,"" Die Zeit newspaper, whose virus tracker has become a go-to resource in Germany, wrote on May 14.

Even so, the government is continuing to move against the virus with purpose.

The Infection Protection Act

On Thursday, the Bundestag passed the Infection Protection Act, a set of precautions to help steer the country from danger as it begins returning to normal.

Testing in care homes and hospitals will be drastically increased. Germany is already testing hundreds of thousands of people a week.

Health authorities must log every negative test result and people considered ""cured,"" so the government can map the virus.

Nurses and care workers will be entitled to a 1,000-euro ($1,080) bonus. Before the crisis there was a shortage of these key workers due to low wages.

Health insurers must now pay for their customers' antibody tests even if they have no symptoms.

Health insurers must make flu vaccines readily available. As winter nears, the government wants to minimize the strain that flu patients place on health services.

'We are seeing half-empty ICUs'

In recent weeks, Germany kept testing people en masse, monitoring those who test positive, and kept intensive care units remained well under capacity.

It allowed those in the most critical of conditions quick, unfettered access to life-saving apparatus like ventilators.

""We are seeing half-empty ICUs in Germany,"" the country's lead epidemiologist, Christian Drosten, said on April 26.

""This is because we started diagnostics early and on a broad scale, and we stopped the epidemic — that is, we brought the reproduction number below 1.""

Germany currently has the capacity to test around 838,000 samples for COVID-19 per week, Reuters reported on Tuesday.

Those who test positive are supervised closely, even after they return to recover in their homes.

In Heidelberg, southwestern Germany, medics were driving around the city checking in on those recently diagnosed with COVID-19, taking blood tests and checking to see if they had deteriorated, The New York Times reported in April.

A lockdown so effective it almost backfired

Drosten, who is director of Berlin's Institute of Virology, added he was concerned the lockdown had worked so well that some citizens didn't understand the dangers of the virus.

Indeed, protests against the lockdown popped up across Germany on April 25. More have taken place since.

While there was strong support for social distancing, and widespread acceptance of a lockdown, many Germans also felt that the state went too far and was ruining the economy.

Ten thousand anti-lockdown protesters are now expected to amass in Munich on May 16.

""For many Germans I'm the evil guy who is crippling the economy,"" Drosten said on April 26.

While Spain and Italy saw death rates as high as 10% in late March, Germany's death rate around the same time — on March 27 — was 0.74%.

Their success was attributed to four factors:

Testing: In March, between 120,000 and 500,000 people were tested each week, according to various reports. One month later, the UK was yet to match the lower end of that estimate.

Luck: As of March 27, the average age of a German infected with coronavirus was 46, whereas in Italy it was 63. Older people are on average far more likely to die from the virus.

In some states, museums and restaurants have been open for more than a week.

On Saturday, the Bundesliga soccer league will recommence. It is the first major league in the world to do so, but for safety the stands will remain empty for the rest of the season, and team handshakes are banned.

The Interior Ministry said on Friday that new arrivals from the EU, Schengen area, and UK would not be forced into a mandatory two-week quarantine upon arrival. Those from other nations, like the US, would.

As of Thursday, 7,917 people have died, with 174,824 confirmed cases. The death rate is at 4.5%.

The rate has risen because it takes a number of weeks for those who eventually die from the the virus to be admitted to hospital, and then enter intensive care.

Germany's death rate is still very low compared to other nations. It is 14% in the UK, 6% in the US, and 15% in France.

On Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel was asked how people should act now the lockdown was ending. ""Social distancing, face masks, and respect,"" she said.

The country's troubles are far from over, though. It is already in a recession, and warned late last month of the worst economic slump in its history this year.

""The German economy has been tip-toeing on the edge of recession since the beginning of 2019, but it can hide no longer,"" said Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

""The economy entered a technical recession at the start of the year, and this before the incoming collapse.""

The economy shrank 2.2% in the first three months of 2020, according to the German statistics agency on Friday.

Nonetheless, when it comes to the coronavirus, Germany has been the envy of many other countries — particularly those that were slow to respond to their own outbreaks.

Economists agree that the US is already in a recession. Now, they're weighing what shape a potential recovery might take.

Many reports this week hit fresh records. But some showed glimmers of hope that a recovery may be coming as some states begin to reopen.

Here are seven economic signals that flashed warnings this week.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

In just two short months, the US economy has been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic and sweeping shut downs to contain the spread of the disease.

Last week's April jobs report showed that the US economy lost a record 20.5 million jobs and the unemployment rate spiked to 14.7%, the highest since the depths of the Great Depression. Since the eye-watering report, more have been released showing further damage to the US economy.

Economists and industry watchers agree that the US has been thrown into a recession from the coronavirus pandemic shutdowns. Now, all eyes are watching US economic data to gauge the extent of the damage and weigh what shape a recovery might take.

Initially, some argued that a swift, V-shaped recovery was possible. But as coronavirus-induced layoffs persist, and many consumers are still stuck at home, it now appears that any rebound will be more muted.

There have also been a few glimmers of hope as many states across the country slowly reopen. For example, even though April's jobs report showed devastating losses, 18.1 million workers were classified as temporarily unemployed, suggesting that they may be able to quickly re-enter the workforce when lockdowns are lifted.

In addition, some reports this week — while dismal — may represent a low point before a rebound. For example, April retail sales posted a second record slump, but may not record a third.

""This report was always going to be terrible,"" said Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics in a Friday note. ""But it likely marks the floor, given the gradual reopening now underway or soon to be underway.""

Business Insider ranked the 20 cities that had the highest share of jobs that require at least a college degree among big metro areas with 600 or fewer people per square mile, using figures from Moody's Analytics.

Low-population-density cities with high educational attainment could bounce back first from the impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic, according to a study from Moody's Analytics.

Adam Kamins, senior regional economist at Moody's Analytics, analyzed which of the 100 largest US metro areas are likely to see the quickest economic recoveries after the outbreak subsides. His analysis shows that places that are less densely populated but also have a large share of jobs that require at least a college degree are likely to bounce back first, while more densely populated cities that have taken an economic hit from the coronavirus will likely take longer to recover.

Moody's Analytics used occupation data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to identify jobs where the minimum requirement is a college degree.

Kamins notes in his analysis that some of the places from his analysis were college towns, such as Durham, North Carolina, home of Duke University, and they could have a higher degree of educational attainment for that reason.

""Still, it makes sense that dynamic economies built around a major university...could enjoy a surge in growth in the years to come,"" Moody's Analytics told Business Insider.

The results also suggest metro areas in the Midwest and Southern region of the US that have jobs requiring high educational attainment and fewer people per square mile are likely to bounce back first.

Using data from Moody's Analytics, we ranked the 20 metro areas that have the largest share of jobs that require a college or graduate degree among cities that have 600 or fewer people per square mile.

The Theodore Roosevelt has been battling a coronavirus outbreak that saw more than 1,000 sailors test positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.

After most of the crew was evacuated ashore, thousands of sailors have started to return to the ship. But, the Navy reports that a number of sailors who were cleared to get back on after testing negative twice have retested positive for COVID-19.

The US Navy reports that the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, which was sidelined by a severe coronavirus outbreak, has had a sailor diagnosed with tuberculosis, another infectious disease.

""In the course of the ship's rigorous infection surveillance, a single active case of TB was identified and diagnosed,"" Pacific Fleet spokesman Cmdr. Myers Vasquez told Politico. ""The individual has been removed from the ship, isolated, and will remain under the direct care of the naval health system until cleared by doctors.""

Unlike the coronavirus, tuberculosis is a bacterial infection, but like the virus that crippled the USS Theodore Roosevelt, it can have a devastating effect on the lungs.

A coronavirus outbreak aboard the aircraft carrier upended its Pacific deployment and forced the ship into port in Guam, where the carrier has been since late March.

As the number of cases climbed, reaching 1,102 by the end of April, the Navy evacuated over 80% of the carrier's crew of roughly 4,800 sailors ashore and placed them in isolation.

In recent weeks, sailors have begun returning to the ship, but only on the condition that they meet the health requirements. As of Thursday, 2,900 sailors had returned to the carrier.

Pacific Fleet said in a statement on Thursday that five sailors who had been cleared to return to the USS Theodore Roosevelt had retested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and were removed from the ship.

The five sailors had previously tested positive for the virus and were removed from the ship and placed in isolation on Guam. All five sailors completed the mandatory 14-day quarantine and tested negative twice before they were allowed to return to the ship.

The number of sailors who have retested positive for COVID-19 after getting back on the ship has more than doubled, Politico reported, revealing that a total of 13 sailors have retested positive.

The US Food and Drug Administration has ordered a Bill Gates-backed coronavirus testing program in Seattle to discontinue indefinitely, The New York Times first reported. The testing program, which offered at-home testing kits to Seattle-area residents under authorization from Washington state, was ordered to stop activities and wait for additional approval from the FDA.

SCAN, or the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network, was testing 300 people a day before it was ordered by the FDA to stop testing, and applications were to be made public soon. In a May 12 blog post, Gates said that SCAN wasn't meant to replace widespread federal testing, but to ""paint a clearer picture of how COVID-19 is moving through the community, who is at greatest risk, and whether physical distancing measures are working.""

But, on May 14, SCAN's website posted an update saying the FDA required additional emergency use authorization (EUA) for self-collected coronavirus tests. The update specified that SCAN asked for EUA on April 13. ""There are no issues or concerns with the safety and accuracy of SCAN's test,"" the update said.

Instead, an FDA spokesperson told The Times, the issue seems to be with the categorization and use of SCAN's tests. The tests are categorized as surveillance tests, which can be used by researchers but cannot be given to patients or doctors for diagnostic purposes. Since SCAN was returning results to patients, the FDA said that the program needed to be subjected to guidelines for diagnostic testing.

SCAN was launched in early March with funding from the Gates Foundation, and was a collaboration between the Seattle and King County Public Health Department, the Brotman Baty Institute, the medicine faculty University of Washington, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and the Seattle Children's Hospital.

According to Gates' blog post, the testing program is an extension of an early flu research program he helped found in 2018, the Seattle Flu Study. The Seattle Flu Study, which previously tracked the spread of the flu during the 2018 season, detected the first coronavirus case in the United States in February.

Fox News has cut its coronavirus coverage by more than 20% in recent weeks, according to data reported by Media Matters for America.

According to the conservative media research group, 95% of weekday segments aired on Fox from March 12 through April 10 were related to the novel coronavirus. But just a month later from April 13 through May 11, coronavirus-related coverage dropped to 74% of weekday segments, and by the middle of May, ""coronavirus-related weekday segments accounted for only 56% of all output from the network.""

The network's coronavirus coverage is significantly smaller when compared to that of CNN, which, according to the data since March 12, had 90% of all weekday coverage except for one feature coronavirus-related stories, according to Media Matters. For MSNBC, coronavirus-related coverage accounted for more than 80% of each day's programming in the same period, the report said.

Fox News initially sparked criticism by downplaying death totals and pushing back against social distancing guidelines in mid-March before on-air talent took a sharp pivot to more serious coverage of the novel coronavirus pandemic as outbreaks took hold of cities across the US through April.

However, on-air figures like host Tucker Carlson repeated calls for President Donald Trump to lift lockdown measures and open businesses across the country, apparently echoing comments by Trump that are in direct opposition to recommendations from leading experts as coronavirus cases steadily rose.

The remaining coverage on the network has focused less on scientific findings behind the pandemic, but instead on pushing stories on the political divide under existing lockdown measures and favorable looks at anti-lockdown protests, though Fox employees are under a work-from-home order through at least June 15.

In the first weeks of May, the network's shrinking coverage of coronavirus-related stories turned toward new revelations like the Department of Justice's attempt to drop the case against retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, and its significance in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

As the death toll among Americans passed 84,000 in the second week of May, the network, alongside Trump's Twitter account, latched on to an ""OBAMAGATE"" scandal.

After Republican senators released a list of administration officials under former President Barack Obama who worked to unmask an American from intelligence reports who turned out to be Michael Flynn, Trump began tweeting harsh but vague allegations against Obama his former Vice President Joe Biden.

An estimated 5% of these countries' populations have coronavirus antibodies — a far cry from the 50-70% required to stop the virus's spread.

Experts warn against a ""very brutal arithmetic"" that sacrifices lives for the goal of herd immunity.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

As more coronavirus antibody tests roll out across the globe, it's becoming increasingly clear that no place is anywhere near the distant, bright horizon of ""herd immunity.""

Populations achieve that benchmark when enough people become infected and recover — thereby developing pathogen-fighting antibodies — to prevent the virus from spreading. For COVID-19, experts estimate the threshold for herd immunity may be as high as 70% of the population.

So far, the first wave of infections has left more than 300,000 people dead worldwide and devastated the global economy. But even the hardest-hit countries are finding that scarcely 10% of their populations have walked away with antibodies.

Tens of thousands are dead, but only 5% of the population may be immune

This week, studies in Spain and France suggested that no more than 5% of those populations have developed COVID-19 antibodies. Each country has reported more than 27,000 deaths from the virus as of Thursday.

Spain's evidence shows that ""large outbreaks and excess mortality do NOT produce meaningful herd immunity,"" William Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard, said on Twitter.

In the US, where nearly 85,000 people have died, the prospects for mass immunity are no better. In April, a study in Santa Clara County, California, estimated that between 2.5% and 4.2% of residents there had antibodies. A study of Los Angeles County made a similar estimate: 2.8% to 5.6% ""seroprevalence"" (the term for the percentage of people who have antibodies in their blood).

A New York antibody study found that 13.9% of New York state residents had been infected with the coronavirus. In New York City, seroprevalence was as high 21.2% — but that was among people who sought out tests (meaning they might have thought they had symptoms). That's still a far cry from the 50-70% required for herd immunity.

That doesn't bode well for other parts of the US, which haven't yet faced devastating waves of infections like the one that killed more than 27,500 people in New York.

""In the US, I estimate there is no more than ~5% seroprevalence,"" Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at University of Florida, wrote on Twitter. ""I don't see any realistic way to reach any [herd immunity] threshold without many, many more deaths.""

'Humans are not herds'

Even Sweden, which has largely allowed life to continue as normal since the beginning of the pandemic, seems nowhere near herd immunity.

Sweden's own public health agency has estimated that, at best, about a quarter of the population of Stockholm might have contracted COVID-19. Over 3,500 people have died in the country — more than 12% of its confirmed cases.

""This idea that, 'well, maybe countries who had lax measures and haven't done anything will all of a sudden magically reach some herd immunity, and so what if we lose a few old people along the way?' This is a really dangerous, dangerous calculation,"" Mike Ryan, executive director of health emergencies at the World Health Organization, said on a call with reporters on Monday.

""Humans are not herds,"" Ryan added. ""I think we need to be really careful when we use terms in this way around natural infections in humans, because it can lead to a very brutal arithmetic which does not put people and life and suffering at the center of that equation.""

Vaccines are the best way to build herd immunity

Eventually, communities or countries could achieve herd immunity through vaccination. But experts say the world should plan to get through the next two years of COVID-19 without it.

Until a vaccine becomes widely available, experts recommend closely monitoring the virus through widespread testing and contact tracing, then isolating infected people and anyone with whom they came into contact. Governments may also need to re-close businesses and put restrictions back into place if infections threaten to surpass local hospital capacities again.

""A very low proportion of the people that have been tested have evidence of antibodies,"" Maria Van Kerkhove, a WHO epidemiologist, said at a press conference on Monday. ""We have a long way to go with this virus, because the virus has more people that can be infected.""

The funding was not previously disclosed. The authors dismissed concerns about a potential conflict of interest and other issues from the study, such as the accuracy of its antibody tests, Buzzfeed reported.

Although the study was revised two weeks after it was made public, it has continued to fuel theories that fears of the coronavirus or its death toll have been overexaggerated.

Cities and states have begun to tentatively get back to business across the US. But as the hardest-hit areas continue to debate whether it's too early to reopen parks, restaurants, and schools, research on the impact of the coronavirus continues to be fraught with controversy.

Now, a whistleblower complaint has called into question a major Stanford University study which suggested the coronavirus death rate could be much lower than reported, comparable to the seasonal flu.

A recent BuzzFeed News investigation from reporter Stephanie Lee has found that the study was in part funded by David Neeleman, the founder of JetBlue Airways and an outspoken opponent of continued coronavirus lockdowns.

Neeleman's contributions to the research were not disclosed, according to a whistleblower complaint filed with Stanford University and obtained by BuzzFeed. Other potential concerns with the study — including questionable accuracy of the antibody tests it relied on — were dismissed, BuzzFeed reported.

Neeleman denied that influenced the study's process or results, and a representative from Stanford said the university was reviewing the complaint, according to Buzzfeed.

The study was cited as evidence that coronavirus fears were exaggerated, and the death rate was closer to the flu

The preprint from Stanford University researchers found that the number of coronavirus infections in Santa Clara, California was up to 85 times higher than previously estimated. Based on the results of testing 3,300 residents of Santa Clara, they concluded that between 2.5% and 4.2% of Santa Clara County residents would have antibodies for the virus.

From this, researchers suggested that the death rate from coronavirus could be around 0.12% to 0.2%, comparable to the flu.

The study was first posted on April 17 as a preprint, meaning it had not yet been peer-reviewed. It was revised April 30 after criticism from other scientists, according to the New York Times.

The Times reported that the Stanford preprint was widely shared by conservative commentators as evidence that the ""hysteria"" around coronavirus deaths was based on exaggerated estimates. Many also argued that the lower death rate could justify re-opening the nation's economy.

JetBlue's founder gave $5,000 to the research while advocating for the economy to reopen, BuzzFeed reported

Neeleman wrote in the Daily Wire that the findings of the Stanford study could be a ""game changer"" for efforts to reopen the economy sooner, based on the idea that a majority of COVID-19 cases have mild or no symptoms. He noted that he personally knew the researchers involved.

The whistleblower complaint — which includes screenshots of emails — alleges that Neeleman personally sought out the researchers because they shared his opinion that the virus was less deadly than believed, BuzzFeed reported, and funded their research.

According to BuzzFeed, Neeleman confirmed that he had made a $5,000 donation to the study but denied that he had influenced the study's design and results, or otherwise put any financial pressure on researchers.

Other concerns with the study, including about inaccurate antibody tests, were dismissed according to a whistleblower

The complaint also references concerns about potential accuracy issues with the antibody test used in the study.

The presence of antibodies can help determine whether or not a person has been infected with coronavirus — however, many of the tests used to detect antibodies are inconsistent and prone to false positives, meaning they could indicate someone has antibodies when in fact do not. The results of the test can vary widely based on the type of test and at what point during an infection a person is tested, Business Insider previously reported.

An infectious disease expert was consulted to evaluate the tests used in the Stanford study. The expert expressed concern that the test ""performed very poorly,"" and later declined to be included in the study because of those concerns, BuzzFeed reported.

Another pathologist, too, tried to voice concerns about the test's accuracy, particularly about the risk of false positives, and recommended that the patients in the study be re-tested. The study was submitted online without additional testing, BuzzFeed reported.

Stanford Medicine is reportedly also looking into the complaint and hasn't yet respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

A spokesperson Julie Greicius told Buzzfeed, ""Stanford Medicine is aware of serious concerns related to the Santa Clara County seroprevalence study.""

""The integrity of Stanford Medicine's research is core to our mission,"" Greicius said. ""When we receive concerns such as this, they are taken extremely seriously.""

Texas succeeded in banning procedures for a month, forcing women to travel hundreds of miles for care in other states. Arkansas now requires women to obtain a negative COVID-19 test to get a surgical abortion.

Even though most restrictions have been lifted, women, abortion providers, and advocates remain on the defensive and fear that care could again be restricted during the pandemic.

The National Abortion Federation's Katherine Ragsdale told Insider she saw ""a danger of ending up in sort of a pre-Roe world where access depends on where you live and what kind of resources you have.""

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

In non-pandemic times, obtaining an abortion already presented serious legal and logistical challenges for millions of women. For patients who live in certain states, getting care means enduring state-imposed waiting periods, submitting to unnecessary ultrasounds, or rushing to receive care before an arbitrary legal deadline. For patients who already have children, care must be arranged. Those without a car need a ride, especially if the nearest clinic is hours away. Some need flights to more accommodating states. And many, many need funds.

But women seeking abortions since the coronavirus outbreak began faced a new challenge — states' attempts to temporarily limit or ban abortion outright by deeming them ""non-essential"" procedures, under the pretext of preserving medical supplies for COVID-19 treatment. These restrictions collided with the travel and social distancing restrictions put in place to limit the spread of the virus, leading to an even more precarious situation for abortion care than the one already in place.

To reach one of the abortion clinics in Planned Parenthood's Rocky Mountain network, one woman had to drive 16 hours from Texas to Colorado to obtain care, Dr. Kristina Tocce, Vice President and Medical Director at Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, told Insider.

Tocce said that since February, the network, which has 24 clinics in Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Southern Nevada, has seen a tenfold increase in women seeking abortions. Some of those women traveled hundreds of miles after neighboring Texas imposed a month-long ban on the procedures, citing the need to reserve medical equipment.

Another patient, unable to find care for a disabled family member, embarked on an ""incredibly long road trip"" with a relative to reach care in Colorado, Tocce said. She drove for two days.

Many more have sought care in New Mexico. Other women have taken the now-extraordinary measure of boarding planes to Denver.

""The pandemic, and some of the bans to essential care that politicians are trying to enforce, just exacerbates unjust laws that have already been passed,"" said Odile Schalit, executive director of the Brigid Alliance, which helps women travel for abortion care.

In states unfriendly to abortion, providers have had to scramble to arrange care, and organizations that help with logistics and funding have pivoted to a war footing. But at the national level, abortion advocates worry that red states' bold actions during the pandemic are just a preview of the obstacles to come.

""I see a danger in returning to a pre-Roe world,"" Reverend Katherine Ragsdale, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation, said, in reference to the 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe V. Wade that legalized abortion nationwide and is perennially under legal siege.

States already unfriendly to abortion capitalized on the coronavirus pandemic to restrict care

During the outbreak, states like Texas, Ohio, Alabama, Iowa attempted to impose some sort of restriction on abortion during the coronavirus outbreak by deeming them non-essential procedures. In Texas, this ban extended to medication abortions as well as surgical ones, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Many of the initial restrictions have expired or eased, and some were struck down after legal challenges, but the episode has left women and abortion rights proponents on the defensive.

Arkansas is currently the only state that actively has abortion restrictions in place due to the coronavirus. A federal appeals court held up an initial ban on surgical abortions, but restrictions elective surgeries began to ease late last month. However, on April 27, the state's health department issued a rule that required a woman to receive a negative coronavirus test result 48 hours before an elective surgery. Arguing that this created a new hurdle to access at a time when the tests remain scarce, the American Civil Liberties Union challenged the case on behalf of Arkansas' last remaining clinic but a federal judge rejected the motion on May 7, the Associated Press reported.

The states issuing or attempting these orders said that they were necessary to preserve PPE, which in some locations has been in desperately short supply as states scramble to deal with their COVID-19 outbreaks.

Around the country, Americans have had to forgo medical care. These so-called ""non-essential"" services could range in severity from dental visits to cancer treatments because of the need to preserve vital PPE.

Abortion, however, is ""a time-sensitive service for which a delay of several weeks, or in some cases days, may increase the risks or potentially make it completely inaccessible,"" the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and American Board of Obstetrics & Gynecology said in a joint statement in response to the attempted bans. ""The consequences of being unable to obtain an abortion profoundly impact a person's life, health, and well-being.""

And these new orders and legal battles threw the prospects for care for millions of women into flux.

The most well-known, and arguably impactful ban, was enacted in Texas this past March. On March 22, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott issued order GA-09, which halted all ""all surgeries and procedures that are not immediately medically necessary."" The order didn't specifically mention abortion, but Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton clarified that these procedures were covered by the order.

The order launched a month-long battle that only ended when it expired on April 21, but not before it threw the state, and the southwest, into chaos. A total of 55,440 abortions were performed in Texas in 2017, according to the Guttmacher Institute, constituting more than 6% of all abortions performed nationwide that year. Abortion advocates went to court to halt the order, which resulted in some delays, but Texas ultimately prevailed, leading to 30-days of on-again, off-again abortion access in a state that already been limiting access for years.

A new order, effective April 22, allows procedures that don't deplete necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) required to combat COVID-19. Abortion is permitted once again, but providers — and women seeking abortions — are still on edge after last month's experience.

""There were several days where we started seeing patients, and a decision was made by a court or something happened where we had to stop,"" Dr. Bhavik Kumar of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast in Houston told Insider.

Kumar and his colleagues had to tell ""hundreds"" of women to go home, or spend hours on the phone re-scheduling appointments with no guarantee that they could provide care on the new date, either.

""They would ask questions like, 'where would we go?' 'What do I do now? I came here to get care.' 'What are my options?' 'Can I come back tomorrow?'"" Kumar said.. They only had two options: Tell women to wait, even knowing that the state had a 20-week abortion ban and the longer a pregnancy continued, the more expensive abortions became; or travel out of state, which could require long — and costly — drives, expensive hotel stays, and the risk potential exposure to the coronavirus.

""I've never had to do anything like that before in my career,"" Kumar said.

The experience not only placed stress on women seeking care, but the uncertainty took a ""huge emotional toll"" on the clinic staff, too, Kumar said.

""We are used to taking care of people. We make them feel better, we can answer their questions,"" he said.. ""When that's robbed of us...that leaves us feeling helpless.""

Some communities were impacted more severely than others, deepening social fault lines that already played a role in abortion access.

""It's definitely the people who struggle the most normally, and it just becomes all the more desperate now,"" Bridget Schilling of the Clinical Access Support Network (CASN), a Houston based-organization that provides funding, logistical and transportation support for women seeking abortions and often refers women to Kumar's clinic.

Even without abortion bans, the unprecedented logistical challenges posed by the COVID-19 outbreak have complicated abortion access.

Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast in Houston had to implement social distancing protocols, meaning fewer patients could be in the clinic at one time.

""Our capacity is very different than it would be outside the pandemic, and on top of that we have a lot more people who need care because there are a number of folks who have been waiting,"" Kumar said.

CASN had to temporarily suspend its volunteer driver program, which provided transportation to and from clinics, after Houston implemented its stay-at-home order. Because of safety concerns for volunteers, Schilling said, the service simply could not continue. Women who needed an abortion had to drive to neighboring states, making their travel arrangements more complicated and costly.

The Louisiana-based New Orleans Abortion Fund (NOAF), which has a similar mission to CASN, was receiving more calls, said Elizabeth Gelvin, NOAF's client services program coordinator.

NOAF has had to go to extra lengths to coordinate care for women from Louisiana, which only has three abortion clinics and already has numerous restrictions including a 20-week abortion ban.

In addition to providing funding for everything from Greyhound bus tickets, airfare, and childcare stipends, they went into overdrive helping to book hotels, and ""really figuring out the nitty gritty of where someone needs to go and how best to get them there, and how most safely to get them there.""

Women from the state often sought care in Texas, Gelvin said, but while the ban was in place that was not an option. Meanwhile, Arkansas, to the north, has also restricted the procedure.

""This new lack of access isn't going to go away quickly""

Organizations at the national level have watched states' attempts to limit abortion during the coronavirus outbreak with apprehension.

Pandemic aside, conservatives and anti-choice lawmakers have already instituted a slew of laws aimed at making it more difficult to get an abortion. Seventeen states already ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, though Supreme Court precedent keeps abortion legalized in all 50 states. Many states have tried to impose six-week bans or eliminate the procedure altogether, though these efforts invariably wind up blocked in court. Meanwhile, states like Tennessee pass flagrantly unconstitutional abortion restrictions with the hope of overturning Roe v. Wade through a legal challenge that escalates to the Supreme Court, which now has a 5-4 conservative tilt.

But during the pandemic states like Texas and Arkansas had managed to do the constitutionally impossible: temporarily halt abortions in the state, by using the coronavirus crisis as justification.

While abortion is currently available in all 50 states, organizations like the National Abortion Federation are preparing for a drawn-out fight as the pandemic continues. It could take more than a year to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus if one can be made at all. And during that time, abortion access could remain in flux.

""Those of us in touch with reality are talking about the understanding that we're not gonna suddenly be back to normal in May or June, probably for at least a year,"" said NAF's Katherine Ragsdale. ""[There's] a danger of ending up in sort of a pre-Roe world where access depends on where you live and what kind of resources you have.""

One mill in upstate New York is operating 18 hours a day to keep up, but barely has enough bags to package flour with.

The supply chain hasn't quite kept up with the shift in demand, which might be why flour is still missing from grocery store shelves.

View more episodes of Business Insider Today on Facebook.

These days it seems like everyone has picked up baking as a quarantine hobby.

That is, if you can find the necessary ingredients. Consumers across the country have reported a lack of yeast and flour at supermarkets since the pandemic started.

But flour producers are telling another story: that they aren't in danger of running out.

""There's not a flour shortage,"" flour miller Thor Oechsner told Business Insider Today. ""The mills are running. We can't get it packaged quick enough to get it out, the way that demand has flipped.""

Oechsner is the co-owner of Farmer Ground Flour, a small company from Trumansburg, New York, that sells mostly wholesale to bakeries and food co-ops. Now, it has lost many of those orders, but demand from individual consumers and supermarkets is higher than ever.

And that means changing how the flour is packaged — which is the real challenge for him.

""Our mill is set up to pretty efficiently build 25- and 50-pound bags going wholesale to bakeries. We are not super well set up to do 2-pound bags. I mean we can do them, but not at this quantity,"" he said.

Since the flour is packaged manually, it is more time-consuming to fill smaller bags.

""For the first three weeks of the whole COVID-19 thing, we got more orders for 2-pound cases than we get normally in almost a year. So it's just this exponential explosion, these 2-pound bags,"" Oechsner said.

The packaging challenges may explain why some consumers are seeing flour sold in unmarked bags or large quantities.

Meanwhile, the shift in demand means flour mills are working overtime. The mill that Oechsner co-owns is operating 18 hours a day. It's also impacting the supply chain, making it hard for flour producers to get the supplies they need.

But Oechsner says he still doesn't know if the increase in demand is enough to make up for the wholesale orders he's lost.

""I think at this point everybody at the mill is so hunkered down trying to fill these orders that nobody exactly knows how this is shaking out financially, just because it's seriously all hands on deck to try to get, you know, even come close to filling these orders,"" he said.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

You should ask about the basics, including the dates of your deferral period, interest rates, and late fees.

Ask how deferral could impact your credit score, property taxes, and homeowners insurance.

If possible, get the terms of your deferral in writing and jot down your ticket number and the customer service agent's name so you can dispute any issues that may come up later.

As millions of Americans lose work due to the coronavirus, mortgage lenders are stepping up and offering assistance. You may be able to defer mortgage payments so that you don't lose your home if you can't pay right now.

There are no hard and fast rules about how lenders should handle mortgage deferrals — so when you set up your deferral, be sure to ask questions about how the process will play out.

If you're on the fence about deferring, the answers to these questions could help you decide whether it's the right move for you. If you know you need to defer payments to make ends meet, asking these questions will help you know what to expect.

11 questions to ask your lender when deferring mortgage payments during the coronavirus

1. Do I qualify for deferment?

First things first: Is deferment even an option?

Some lenders will ask for proof of economic hardship, including pay stubs or a letter from your employer. Others will accept your application without asking follow-up questions.

2. How long will my deferment period last?

If you have a government-backed loan through Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, FHA, USDA, or VA, you should be able to request up to 180 days of forbearance — and then ask for another 180-day extension if you're still financially struggling after your initial deferral period.

If you don't have a government-backed mortgage, you'll have to adhere to the lender's policy about deferral period lengths. Be sure to ask how long deferral lasts and whether the company considers extensions if you still can't make payments when your deferral ends.

3. What are the exact dates of my deferral period?

You may know your mortgage is deferred for three months, 120 days, or 180 days — but what are the exact dates? When will you have to make your next payment?

Write these dates down so you don't misunderstand and miss a payment later, only to be slammed with a late fee. Also, if you find out the deferral period is retroactive, you may be able to receive a refund for your most recent payment.

4. Will deferring hurt my credit score?

Many lenders have issued statements saying they won't report forbearance, missed payments, or late payments to credit bureaus so your credit score can stay in tact. But considering your credit score holds a lot of borrowing and buying power, it's good to double-check before you enroll in forbearance.

5. Will I be charged late fees?

Few lenders are penalizing people with late fees during the pandemic, but double-check to be sure.

6. Will interest continue to accrue?

Even though lenders are pausing mortgage payments, it's rare for them to suspend interest on your loan. Ask whether interest will continue to build and discuss how that could practically affect your loan.

7. When and how do I have to pay back the deferred amount?

The repayment process is probably the most confusing aspect of enrolling in mortgage deferral during the coronavirus pandemic. Some lenders offer just one repayment option, while others provide multiple choices. Here are the most common methods:

Repay the deferred amount in one lump sum once your deferral period ends.

Tack the missed payments onto the end of your loan term. For example, if you defer payments for three months, your loan term switches from 30 years to 30 years and three months.

Spread the deferred amount across the life of your mortgage so that your monthly payment increases.

If your mortgage is backed by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, you can request a specific repayment method beginning July 1, 2020: Make one lump sum payment when your mortgage term ends. This means you pay the total deferred amount when you sell or refinance your home, or when you pay off the home completely.

8. Will deferral hurt my chances of getting financing in the near future?

Even during the pandemic, deferral is often a sign of economic hardship. As a result, many lenders won't offer additional home financing if you enroll in deferral — at least not until you prove yourself to be a responsible borrower again, which could take months.

This means you could struggle to refinance or buy another home in the next year or so.

There's no concrete rule about lending after deferral during the coronavirus outbreak, so it's possible your lender will make an exception. Don't be afraid to ask upfront.

9. How will deferral affect my taxes and insurance?

Some people pay their property taxes and insurance separately from their mortgages, while others bundle it all into one payment. Ask your lender if you still have to pay taxes and insurance while your mortgage is in deferral, or if you can pause all these expenses.

10. Can I get this agreement in writing?

Customer service agents are human — it's possible they'll tell you incorrect information.

Maybe your lender says it won't report deferral to credit bureaus, but you see it pop up on your credit report and your score plummets. Or you get hit with a late fee even after a customer support representative said there wouldn't be any penalties.

In these cases, having an email or letter with the terms of your deferral can help you dispute issues.

11. Can I have your name and/or my ticket number?

If you face penalties or your credit score is docked even though the customer service agent said there wouldn't be a problem, having their name on hand could give your argument more validity.

Many customer service departments assign emails and chat sessions ""ticket numbers,"" so knowing yours can help you resolve a problem more quickly later.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

If you've lost your job due to the coronavirus and worry about affording mortgage payments, ask your lender whether they're making exceptions for people who have been impacted.

You may choose to refinance for lower monthly payments and a lower interest rate.

If you've built equity in your home, you can tap into your equity through a cash-out refinance or HELOC and use the money to pay bills.

As businesses around the US close to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, millions of Americans are losing work and worrying about how to pay their bills.

If you're concerned about affording mortgage payments, take comfort in knowing you have options. Here are three possible paths you can take moving forward.

1. Ask your lender about assistance for home owners impacted by COVID-19

Federal mortgage loan companies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are making exceptions for homeowners who have been financially impacted by the coronavirus.

You can apply for forbearance for up to 12 months without facing penalties, and the companies won't report forbearance to credit unions. Beginning July 1, 2020, people with a Fannie Mae- or Freddie Mac-backed mortgage can choose to repay their deferred amount in one lump sum when they sell, refinance, or pay off their home entirely.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are offering mortgage modification programs to decrease monthly payments, and they are temporarily suspending evictions and foreclosures.

Most private lenders are also providing relief for homeowners who have been impacted by COVID-19. In California, over 200 banks and credit unions have agreed to waive mortgage payments for 90 days without hurting borrowers' credit scores.

""The first step, if you're looking for relief, is just to call your bank up and get someone on the phone,"" says Andy Taylor, general manager of Credit Karma Home. ""It might be a long queue to get through, but bear with it, because it's important. And ask what your options are.""

Taylor says institutions will probably ask for proof of economic hardship before agreeing to alter your mortgage payments. You may be able to show pay stubs or a letter from your employer to verify you qualify for assistance.

2. Look into refinancing with a small company

Maybe your lender isn't offering exceptions during the outbreak, or you just want to explore other options. Depending on what type of loan you have and how much of your mortgage is left outstanding, refinancing may be a good option.

When you refinance your mortgage, you take out a brand new loan with a new interest rate. If your credit score and financial history are strong, you might be able to score a lower rate than you have now.

""Probably the best way is to find your local mom-and-pop credit union,"" says Taylor. ""Someone who isn't going to have a nationwide footprint, who isn't going to be as inundated as someone who's advertising globally online.""

Lenders have been slammed with refinancing applications the past few weeks. But some small companies might be less overwhelmed, giving them the ability to act more quickly and give you personalized attention.

""Or find a local mortgage broker,"" Taylor continues. ""Mortgage brokers can often unlock loan products that you wouldn't be able to find as a typical consumer, because they can shop around for a greater variety of loan products that are out there.""

As an added bonus, you'll be helping local credit unions and mortgage brokers that might be hurting financially during the coronavirus pandemic. ""You can support them, get a better rate, solve your cash flow problem, and pay a little less out of pocket every month,"" says Taylor. ""That's a good thing all around.""

3. Tap into your home equity

Have you gained equity in your home? Maybe your home's value has increased, or you've paid down your mortgage substantially. Look for ways to liquidate that equity to access cash for mortgage payments.

Taylor says homeowners with equity might consider cash-out refinancing.

Cash-out refinancing is a little different from regular refinancing. You still get a brand new loan, but now the loan amount is for more than what you owe.

Subtract the amount you owe from the amount you receive as a loan. You get to pocket what's left. You're allowed to spend that money on other financial needs — like mortgage payments.

""You could both simultaneously cash out the equity in your home — take a little bit of money that you've built up — and also lock in a lower rate,"" says Taylor. ""That solves two problems. One, it can solve a cash flow problem, namely you're paying a lower amount every single month. And two, it means you can use that money for things like paying for the mortgage itself.""

Another option opening a home equity line of credit, Taylor says. A HELOC is a second mortgage that works sort of like a credit card; use this line of credit used to pay for things, then pay back the borrowed money plus interest each month.

While money from your HELOC doesn't go toward mortgage payments, it can help you stay afloat by covering expenses like utility bills or car payments.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

If you've been financially affected by the coronavirus, you can ask companies about their policies regarding late or missed payments.

Some companies are making exceptions for people who have been impacted by the coronavirus.

You might be able to pause payments toward memberships, credit cards, utilities, insurance, rent, mortgage, auto loans, and federal and private student loans.

Many employees are out of work or facing reduced hours as US businesses temporarily close to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Lenders are empathizing with people who are struggling to pay their bills during the pandemic.

If you reach out to companies, you may be able to pause any of these eight bills — and make life a little less stressful during the outbreak.

1. Memberships and subscriptions

It may seem like we're beating a dead horse by recommending you cancel memberships and subscriptions to save money. But while people might normally tell you to cut out frivolous expenses like streaming services, that's not necessarily the best move here.

After all, you're going to be spending a lot of time at home. Is now really the time to delete your Netflix account?

Instead, think about expenses that will no longer be relevant while you're self-isolating. If your gym is closed indefinitely, pause your monthly payments. If you're a season ticket holder to an amusement park that has closed or for a sports team whose season has been canceled, call the ticket office to discuss cancellation.

In some cases, you may want to ask whether you can pause rather than cancel a membership. For example, if you cancel your gym membership, you might have to pay the joining fee again when you finally go back. Hopefully, pausing payments eliminate that extra expense.

2. Credit card payments

No one wants to miss a credit card payment. Neglecting to make a minimum payment on time can hurt your credit score. When you fail to pay off the full statement balance every month, you have to pay interest.

Thankfully, many credit card issuers are making accommodations for borrowers who have been financially affected by the coronavirus. Companies are encouraging these members to contact a representative to discuss their options. Some issuers are allowing people to skip payments without accruing interest.

3. Utilities

Companies such as CenterPoint Energy, Xcel Energy, and Minnesota Power have announced they won't shut off customers' power if they're unable to pay at this time.

Charter is installing free WiFi and Broadband for new customers, and it will remain free for 60 days. Arvig is offering free internet and WiFi to new customers who have K-12 or college students in their households. These customers won't have to pay until schools reopen.

Check whether your utility company has already announced exceptions for payments online. If so, call up the company to tell them about your situation. You can still give them a call if you can't find any information about special circumstances online. It's possible they're still willing to work with you.

4. Federal student loan payments

Under the CARES Act, federal student loan payments are suspended until September 30, 2020. No interest accrues during this time. You won't be penalized for skipping these payments, and your credit score won't be affected.

The CARES Act is referring to Direct federal student loans that are owned by the Department of Education. Private loans, refinanced loans, and FFEL and Perkins loans owned by private companies or colleges do not qualify for forbearance under the CARES Act.

The Department of Education has paused all federal student loan payments, so any automatic payments will be suspended. If you'd like to continue making payments until September 30 to eliminate debt more quickly, call your student loan servicer to reinstate automatic payments.

If you're enrolled in a student loan forgiveness program but skip payments until September 30, these months will still count toward your required number of payments to receive forgiveness, even if you don't pay anything. In order for these months to count toward your PSLF credits, you must still be employed full-time during this period.

If you've made a federal student loan payment since March 13, you can contact your servicer to request a refund.

5. Private student loan payments

Many private student loan companies are encouraging borrowers to contact representatives to discuss payment options. Some are making exceptions for people who have been financially impacted by the coronavirus.

Some lenders already have policies in place to accommodate borrowers who are out of work. For example, Wells Fargo's Loan Modification Program lowers your monthly payments. It also offers short-term payment relief, which lasts for two months. Most lenders also offer forbearance, although terms vary.

6. Insurance payments

Several big-name insurance companies are making exceptions for people who have been impacted by the coronavirus. For example, Liberty is offering auto insurance customers 15% refunds on two months of premiums, and GEICO will no longer cancel your coverage if you miss payments or allow your policy to expire through May 31.

Call your insurance providers to ask whether they're willing to accommodate your situation. Even just pausing payments for a month or two may help alleviate your financial burden.

7. Rent or Mortgage Payments

Numerous cities have temporarily forbidden landlords from evicting tenants who can't pay rent. Whether your city has released an official stance on evictions or not, contact your landlord to discuss your job loss. You might be able to set up a payment plan or defer payment for a month or two.

For homeowners, federal mortgage lending companies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are offering forbearance for up to 12 months, and beginning July 1, you can request to put off repayment until you sell, refinance, or pay off the home completely.

Some private lenders are allowing forbearance for up to 120 days. Contact your lender and be prepared to show proof of economic hardship.

8. Auto payments

Many lenders are working with people who have lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus and struggling to make car loan payments. Ally Bank is offering auto payment deferment for up to 120 days.

Some car manufacturers are extending a hand to borrowers, too. For example, Hyundai's finance team is allowing current car owners to defer payments for up to three months.

If you pause mortgage payments due to the coronavirus, you can request to repay in one lump sum at the end of your loan term.

You'll make one payment when your loan term ends, or when you sell or refinance the home.

This repayment option doesn't increase your monthly bill or result in more owed interest, and it gives you time to save money for a lump sum payment.

Servicers must provide this deferral repayment option for people with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans beginning July 1, 2020.

Read more personal finance coverage »

You may have heard that you can request forbearance for up to a year if you have a government-backed mortgage and have been impacted by the coronavirus. In fact, maybe you've already enrolled with your servicer.

When you defer your government-backed loan, your payments are paused for 180 days. You can request an extension of up to another 180 days if you're still struggling after your initial forbearance period ends.

Pausing mortgage payments can be a huge source of relief for people who have lost work during the pandemic. However, there's been a lot of confusion about how and when you're expected to repay the delayed payments — depending on your lender's repayment policy, you could end up in a major jam later.

The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has created a new deferral option for people with a loan backed by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, two government mortgage companies. The purpose of this deferral program is to eliminate confusion and make repayments more manageable for borrowers.

When your mortgage term ends, you repay the deferred amount in one lump sum

The premise of the FHFA's new deferral option is simple: When your loan term ends, you pay back the total deferred amount all at once, regardless of whether you sell, refinance, or pay off your home entirely.

If you have a 30-year mortgage with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and defer for one year during the pandemic, your loan term will still only last 30 years. At the end of the 30-year period, you'll repay the year's worth of payments you paused during the pandemic in one big payment.

If you sell your home or refinance before paying it off, you repay the deferred amount in one lump sum.

Lenders must offer this new deferral repayment option for Fannie Mae- and Freddie Mac-backed loans beginning July 1, 2020.

The new repayment method is better for many homeowners than other options

Prior to the new FHFA repayment option, lenders were enforcing various rules for how and when you had to pay back your deferred government mortgage payments. Many lenders were offering one or more of the following options:

Repay the deferred amount in one lump sum once your forbearance period ends. This policy may seem unfair if you've lost work due to the coronavirus — if you couldn't afford mortgage payments for months, why would anyone expect you to be able to make months' worth of payments all at once?

This policy may seem unfair if you've lost work due to the coronavirus — if you couldn't afford mortgage payments for months, why would anyone expect you to be able to make months' worth of payments all at once? Tack the missed payments onto the end of your loan term. For example, if you defer payments for three months, your loan term switches from 30 years to 30 years and three months. Adding payments to the end of a term is a better short-term solution, but it means you'll be paying for a longer period of time and paying more in interest.

For example, if you defer payments for three months, your loan term switches from 30 years to 30 years and three months. Adding payments to the end of a term is a better short-term solution, but it means you'll be paying for a longer period of time and paying more in interest. Spread the deferred amount across the life of your mortgage so that your monthly payment increases. This option could make mortgage payments tight — possibly for years.

The FHFA's new repayment option removes plenty of confusion from the conversation. You now have the right to request a specific repayment method rather than leave it up to your servicer.

This deferral option lets you kick the bucket down the road. Now you can pay a lump sum in a few years (or maybe even a few decades), rather than in a couple months, which gives you more time to financially prepare.

Your monthly payments will also stay the same, and you won't pay more in interest as a result of coronavirus-related forbearance.

Homeowners with other types of government-backed mortgages or loans with private lenders still have to adhere to their servicers' rules about repayments. However, people borrowing through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac finally have a little more control.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

An official with the Chinese National Health Commission said on Friday that the samples were destroyed in line with public health laws and to ""prevent the risk to laboratory biological safety.""

But he insisted that it was not done to cover up or hide samples from other countries — an accusation that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had previously made.

Pompeo has repeatedly attacked the Chinese Communist Party for attempting to cover up the extent of the outbreak, which has so far killed more than 88,000 people in the US alone.

The news comes as tensions between the US and China appear to be deteriorating, with the president and his administration blaming the country for having started the virus deliberately.

China has confirmed that it had ordered unauthorized laboratories to destroy samples of the new coronavirus but insisted that it was due to ""biosafety reasons.""

The announcement comes after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has repeatedly said that China refused to give virus samples taken from patients infected with COVID-19 in late December last year and that officials had destroyed early samples, according to South China Morning Post.

Liu Dengfeng, an official with the Chinese National Health Commission's science and education department, said in a Beijing briefing on Friday that the samples were destroyed to ""prevent the risk to laboratory biological safety and prevent secondary disasters caused by unidentified pathogens.""

He insisted that this was not done to cover-up or hide samples from other countries, but was done strictly for biosafety reasons.""The remarks made by some US officials were taken out of context and intended to confuse,"" Liu said.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks at a news conference at the State Department in Washington on April 29, 2020. Associated Press

Liu said that when the pneumonia-like disease was first reported in Wuhan, ""national-level professional institutes"" were working to identify the pathogen that was causing it.

""Based on comprehensive research and expert opinion, we decided to temporarily manage the pathogen causing the pneumonia as Class II – highly pathogenic – and imposed biosafety requirements on sample collection, transport, and experimental activities, as well as destroying the samples,"" he said.

The official said that this was standard practice in China for the handling any highly pathogenic samples.

Chinese public health laws specify that laboratories not meeting the requirements must either transfer them to a qualified depositary for safekeeping or destroy them.

Liu Dengfeng did not mention the Trump administration's claims that the virus originated in a laboratory in Wuhan, China.

Pompeo has previously attacked the Chinese Communist Party for attempting to cover up the extent of the outbreak. He has accused the country of not reporting accurate numbers and of censoring research regarding the coronavirus.

""The Chinese Communist Party tried to suppress information about this virus, about where it began, about how it started, about how it was being transmitted from human to human, indeed employed the World Health Organization to further that storyline,"" Pompeo told Christian radio program Focus on the Family, earlier this week, Newsweek reported.

The news comes as tensions between the US and China appear to be escalating. While Trump initially praised President Xi Jinping's response to the outbreak in January, the president and his administration have since blamed it for deliberately starting the virus.

Trump added to White House speculation in April when he said that he had evidence showing that the coronavirus originated from a lab in Wuhan, China, but that he would not reveal what it is.

Earlier this month, Trump suggested that China's handling of the novel coronavirus is proof that Beijing ""will do anything they can"" to ensure he isn't reelected in November.

House Democrats on Friday night passed a sweeping, $3 trillion coronavirus rescue package.

The bill, the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, or the HEROES Act, spans 1,815 pages and won't become law. Instead, its passage was meant for Democrats to demonstrate their priorities and signal what they will fight for in a later bipartisan bill that could pass in June.

Senate Republicans told Business Insider they think more time should pass before they take up another relief bill so they can analyze the holes in funding from the other four relief packages they've already passed. President Donald Trump signed a $484 billion coronavirus aid bill in late April. The $2 trillion relief bill, known as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, became law in late March.

The HEROES Act won't be taken up for a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate and Trump has called it ""dead on arrival."" Speaking Thursday night on ""Special Report"" with Fox News' Bret Baier, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the House legislation a ""liberal wish list"" that ""strikes me as hardly salvageable.""

Instead of a funding package, McConnell is preparing a bill to shield employers from federal lawsuits if their customers or workers become sick from the coronavirus. While Democrats have said they are concerned about such changes, they might be willing to negotiate a deal to get some of their provisions from the HEROES Act to Trump's desk.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office published a 71-page summary of the bill, which you can read here. Her office didn't work with the White House to craft the bill and instead encouraged members to ""think big"" for the legislation.

""Families know that hunger doesn't take a pause, not having a job doesn't take a pause, not being able to pay the rent doesn't take a pause,"" Pelosi said during her weekly press conference Thursday about the need to pass another relief bill soon. ""The hardship of it all, losing a loved one or having someone in your family sick, it just doesn't take a pause.""

Below are some of the provisions that were included in the bill:

Nearly $1 trillion for states and local governments

The HEROES Act would set aside $500 billion for states, which are losing out on revenue during the coronavirus lockdowns and also expending more money to fight the virus.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer previously acknowledged the sum was ""an awful lot of money"" but said it was ""essential"" to halt layoffs of police, firefighters, nurses, and teachers. The bill would set aside another $375 billion for cities and other local governments and $20 billion to help territories.

Washington, DC, would receive $755 million. When $150 billion in funds were sent to states under the CARES Act, the capital was treated as a US territory, rather than a state. As a result, it received about $700,000. In contrast, states on average received about $1.2 billion each, Hoyer said.

$25 billion to aid the Postal Service

Democrats want to rescue the US Postal Service with $25 billion in funding. Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, who chairs the committee that oversees the Postal Service, said that without the funding, the agency wouldn't be able to survive beyond a few months.

The HEROES Act would provide an extra $15 million for the Office of the Postal Service Inspector General for oversight of the funding.

$175 billion for healthcare providers

Healthcare providers have already received $175 billion through other relief bills but have said the money won't be enough. The HEROES Act would add another $100 billion for hospitals and medical practices. The sum would go toward both recouping money they spent to fight the coronavirus and making up for the dollars they lost from putting off other medical procedures.

The bill would allow $75 billion to go toward testing and tracing people who may have been infected with the virus, adding to the $25 billion already allocated under previous legislation. The Trump administration would need to come up with a national testing plan and put out an awareness campaign on testing.

More money for people, housing, and food stamps

Under the bill, people would get another $1,200 in relief checks for single filers and $2,400 for joint filers, similar to what they got under the CARES Act.

In addition, people who are laid off would get $600 extra in unemployment benefits a week through January 31. The benefits are set to expire on July 31.

Democrats would increase funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps low-income people buy food, by $10 billion.

The bill would also put aside $100 billion to provide emergency assistance to help low-income renters at risk of homelessness avoid eviction because of the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

Increasing health-insurance coverage

The HEROES Act would set up a special enrollment period for people who don't have health insurance to sign up for private coverage via Healthcare.gov, where millions of people will get government help paying their premiums. People who lost their jobs in recent months are already eligible to sign up for the coverage, but the change from Democrats would allow others who were already uninsured to enroll.

The bill would open a second opportunity for people to get health-insurance coverage by having the government for nine months subsidize the health insurance people used to get through work. Typically, laid-off workers have to pay the full cost for these plans — under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act — on their own, but the HEROES Act would have the government pick up the full cost of premiums.

Letting more people vote by mail

The HEROES Act would provide $3.6 billion for grants to states for contingency planning, preparation, and resilience of elections, according to a document prepared by Democratic staff on the House Appropriations Committee.

The legislation would also have states set up voting by mail in the November elections so that states could either move to only mail voting or make it easier for people to vote through absentee ballots. Democrats have said this setup would help keep people safe if the US is still in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic at that time.

The CARES Act included $400 million for states to shore up their elections, a sum Democrats say is inadequate.

Giving a raise to 'essential workers'

Democrats want to boost pay for people who are unable to do their jobs from home during the pandemic, including healthcare workers, grocery-store workers, and federal employees.

The bill allocates $200 billion for hazard pay and cites the legislation Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer put forward in April. It would allow frontline workers to get as much as a $25,000 raise through the end of 2020. The amount is equivalent to giving the workers an additional $13 an hour for continuing to work during the pandemic.

$90 billion to help schools and colleges

The bill would set up $90 billion in grants that states can use to help schools with costs, including the cost of mental-health services, cleaning, buying additional technology, and emergency planning. States could also help colleges recoup money they've lost or help professors learn the new technology they need to use to teach remotely.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

Gavin Newsom is proposing that the state close two prisons, in part due to a decline in tax revenue amid the pandemic.

Over 500 California prisoners currently have COVID-19. At least five have died.

""As we have seen, jails and prisons have become petri dishes for this pandemic,"" state Rep. Sydney Kamlager, a Democrat from Los Angeles, told Business Insider.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Left-leaning activists for social justice do not, typically, have kind words for austerity, which brings to mind shuttered schools and trimmed welfare rolls. But when California Gov. Gavin Newsom outlined plans this week to slash the state's budget, citing a freefall in tax revenue due to the pandemic, there was qualified praise from some over his decision to cut funding for prisons.

California currently has over 117,000 people in its prisons, more than any other state except for Texas. But the number of incarcerated persons has been falling — by 8% just this year — and that, the product of reduced sentences for drug crimes and efforts to address overcrowding, has meant the state is in a position to begin closing some of its prisons.

In January, Newsom, a Democrat, wanted to close one detention center. Now he wants to close two — and to do it fast. That will save money; according to the state's Legislative Analyst's Office, by more than $100 million per year. It could also save lives.

""As we have seen, jails and prisons have become petri dishes for this pandemic,"" state Rep. Sydney Kamlager, a Democrat from Los Angeles, told Business Insider. ""Closed quarters, lack of circulating air, and staff and vendors who are not regularly tested — and walk in and out — are recipes for public health disasters.""

At least five people have died from COVID-19 while incarcerated in a state prison, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation; another 524 currently have caught the disease while behind bars.

Last month, Kamlager, who chairs the state committee on incarcerated women, told Business Insider that she hoped that efforts to reduce the prison population, in an effort to arrest the spread of the coronavirus, would extend beyond the current crisis.

Amber-Rose Howard, executive director of Californians United for a Responsible Budget, ""is excited to see the commitment from the governor to close prisons."" But her organization, a coalition of 70 activist groups that advocate cutting prison spending, says the governor's proposal is just a start.

""We believe that California can close five prisons in the next five years,"" Howard told Business Insider. In part, that can be achieved by accelerating early release, as California has started to do in response to the coronavirus. ""Over 20% of the prison population is over the age of 55,"" she noted. ""We need to see the state pushing for elder parole modifications that would release a larger population of people, who statistically have the least risk of contact with law enforcement after release.""

Newsom's proposal, which will require approval by California's Democratic-controlled legislature, already gestures at that, proposing to cut the maximum length of parole — and thus the chances one could be incarcerated over a parole violation — from five years to 24 months.

But with 34 prisons, and plans to close only two over the next three years, critics of mass incarceration see much room for improvement, from the governor granting clemency more often, to voters themselves overturning the state's notorious ""three strikes"" sentencing law.

""I believe there is a better way,"" Rep. Kamlager commented. ""The current system is not it.""

Voting by proxy — without being ""present"" as the Constitution requires — is an unprecedented move, which wasn't even resorted to during other challenging moments in US history.

Democrats argue the House can rely on technology for remote work as the pandemic drags on. But Republicans objected to what they see as a power grab during the crisis. The vote was 217-189.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Neither Civil War nor Great Depression nor any other national crisis has pushed the House to allow lawmakers to vote by proxy — without being ""present,"" as the Constitution requires. That's about to change during the coronavirus pandemic.

The House approved Friday a package of historic rules changes so Congress can keep functioning even while it's partly closed. The shift will dramatically change the look, if not the operation, of the legislative branch — launching a 21st century WFH House, like others, ""working from home.""

Members Congress clinb the steps of the House of Representatives for final votes, at the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, July 31, 2014. AP

""This House must continue legislating,"" Rep. Jim McGovern, the chairman of the House Rules Committee, said during a lengthy session ahead of the vote. ""And we have to do so in a way that is safe for all those around us.""

Debate over the changes has been fierce. As President Donald Trump encourages Americans back to work, the 435-member House has stayed away due to health risks while the smaller Senate has resumed operations.

Democrats argue the House can rely on technology for remote work as the pandemic drags on. But Republicans objected to what they see as a power grab during the crisis. The vote was 217-189.

Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the rules panel, warned the changes will fundamentally alter the nature of the institution, ""and not for the better.""

One by one Republicans lined up Friday to speak against it.

""We should all get to Washington, do our jobs,"" said Rep. Bradley Byre, R-Ala.

Under the new rules, House lawmakers will no longer be required to travel to Washington to participate in floor votes. They will be allowed to vote by proxy — assigning their vote to another lawmaker who will be at the Capitol to cast it for them. Eventually, a provision allows for direct remote voting, once the technology is approved.

Just as important, the House committees — the bread and butter of legislative work — will be able to fully function remotely. Committee hearings are prime-time for lawmakers — the chance to grill officials, spar with colleagues and have much of it captured on C-SPAN. House lawmakers will be able to draft bills, conduct oversight and even issue subpoenas from the comfort of their homes.

""This is about allowing the people's House — and the people's representatives in committees — to work,"" Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., who has helped lead the effort, testified before the Rules Committee.

With the Capitol physician warning it could be years before Congress resumes full operations, lawmakers are anxious to chart a new normal and not be sidelined.

An earlier proposal was shelved two weeks ago as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insisted she wanted any change of this significance to be bipartisan. She tapped a task force to try to reach a bipartisan compromise.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy proposed a ""hybrid"" plan that would allow the committees to conduct work remotely but stopped short of allowing the proxy voting on the floor.

A key Trump ally, McCarthy argues if other Americans are at work, Congress should be, too. ""It's a very sad day inside this House,"" the California Republican said. He mocked Pelosi for having claimed the House would serve as the ""captain"" of the ship, last to leave during the crisis, only to go home.

The changes are expected to be temporary, only through the remainder of this session of Congress, at the end of the year. Democrats insist the changes should be used only under times of crisis.

But Republicans warn there will be legal challenges to legislation passed during this period, questioning the constitutional legitimacy of proxy votes. The House has never allowed proxy floor votes, even during some of the most challenging eras in the nation's history. Lawmakers convened during the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic and only stayed away a short time after the 2001 terror attacks. Proxy votes had been allowed in committees, but that ended decades ago. Under the new rules, one lawmaker can carry up to 10 votes by proxy to the Capitol.

""You got to be here,"" said another Trump ally, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. ""You can't phone it in.""

Called antibody or ""serology"" tests, they look for antibodies the body produces after infection.

But even as millions flood the US healthcare system, their accuracy is wide-ranging.

Sparingly few have demonstrated 100% sensitivity to the antibodies, though with small sample sizes.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Nearly 200 companies are creating tests that aim tell people if they've been exposed to the novel coronavirus.

Unlike a test that diagnoses the virus itself, the goal of these kits is to identify past exposure by looking for antibodies the body made to fight off the virus. Generally, antibodies stick around for weeks, months, or sometimes years after infections — and they often confer some level of immunity to the disease in question.

It's not yet understood how long and how well antibodies might protect a person from contracting COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Nevertheless, experts have said large-scale antibody testing is necessary to help safely reopen the country. Employers are thinking about using it to determine which people should go back to work, and when. States, hospitals, academic centers, and laboratories are rolling them out to healthcare workers, children, and every day people with growing frequency.

But the accuracy of coronavirus antibody tests is being called into question, partly due to earlier, relaxed approval requirements by the US Food and Drug Administration. Companies rushed their kits into the US healthcare system after varying degrees of study; when problems with those tests began to pop up, the FDA released tougher approval criteria on May 4.

That said, larger healthcare groups are now offering tests to US consumers by the millions while researchers continue to independently study the performance of tests.

Quest Diagnostics is offering tests through Abbott Laboratories, PerkinElmer's Euroimmun business, and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, for instance. Laboratory Corporation of America (LabCorp) is only offering Euroimmun's test, according to a spokesperson for the company, but for way less money than Quest's program.

The costs of antibody tests currently available to consumers ranges widely, from free (through some medical insurance policies or population surveys) to more than $100. Primary care physicians can order antibody tests for patients. You can also find them through government survey programs. New York City, for example, offers antibody tests to any children with COVID-19 symptoms through NYC Health + Hospitals, which is also using Abbott's kit.

If you're symptomatic and can't take a diagnostic test to detect the virus itself, such as through a spit or nasal swab sample, medical experts told Business Insider that it's best to wait a while before getting an antibody test. (The body takes some time to make them, so antibody tests become most accurate starting about two weeks after symptoms begin.)

The following list includes companies that have emergency authorization from the FDA, plus one with a high-performing test that doesn't yet have agency approval. Results are ranked by test sensitivity, or ability to detect true positives, though separate scores pertaining to specificity, or ability to detect true negatives, are also included. The scores are based on internal studies conducted by the companies, as well as external ones where available.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

The COVID-19 pandemic is the latest example of a well established phenomenon — viruses commonly jump from an animal host to humans. This type of cross-species hop, called a spillover event, also led to the outbreaks of Ebola and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Both of those viruses originated in bats, and genetic research has all but confirmed the same for the new coronavirus.

A study published in February found that the new virus, whose scientific name is SARS-CoV-2, shares 96% of its genetic code with a coronavirus called RaTG13 that circulates in Chinese bats. This week, researchers found an even closer match: A study in the journal Current Biology describes a previously unknown coronavirus named RmYN02 that's 97.1% similar to SARS-CoV-2. It was found in the bats in China's Yunnan province between May and October 2019.

Despite these close matches, however, neither of these viruses are the new coronavirus' direct ancestor. Lingering questions about exactly where and when the outbreak started have given rise to a range of unsubstantiated theories.

""Since the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 there have been a number of unfounded suggestions that the virus has a laboratory origin,"" Weifeng Shi, the lead author of the recent study, said in a press release. He added that the discovery of RmYN02 provides ""strong evidence against SARS-CoV-2 being a laboratory escape.""

Although it's not impossible for a stored sample of a bat coronavirus to leak from a lab, it's far more likely that this one jumped naturally from bats to an intermediary species before making its way into our population.

Infectious-disease researchers had been warning of the potential for exactly such a spillover event for years.

Many spillovers have occurred in the past

Experts have long agreed that the next pandemic was always a matter of when, not if.

""The world needs to prepare for pandemics in the same serious way it prepares for war,"" Bill Gates said during a 2018 conference. ""If history has taught us anything, it's that there will be another deadly global pandemic.""

The year prior, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned of the inevitability of a ""surprise outbreak"" of a new disease.

""There is no question that there will be a challenge to the coming administration in the arena of infectious diseases,"" Fauci said during a 2017 speech at Georgetown University, specifically highlighting the threat of unknown diseases.

""The thing we're extraordinarily confident about is that we're going to see this in the next few years,"" he added.

Three out of every four emerging infectious diseases come to us from other species; these pathogens are known as zoonotic diseases.

The 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic — swine flu — started in pigs then killed nearly 300,000 people. People have caught bird flus via direct contact with infected poultry. Other pandemic influenza strains, including the 1957 ""Asian flu"" and the 1968 Hong Kong pandemic, likely started in birds, too.

And in the last 45 years, at least four epidemics — including SARS — have been traced back to bats.

""Bats and birds are considered reservoir species for viruses with pandemic potential,"" Bart Haagmans, a virologist at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, Netherlands, previously told Business Insider.

Researchers traced the SARS coronavirus to a population of horseshoe bats in China's Yunnan province; humans caught it from civet cats at a wet market in Guangdong. The virus killed 774 people and infected more than 8,000 in eight months.

Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), also a coronavirus, first passed from bats to dromedary camels. It circulated in the camel population undetected for decades before jumping to humans in 2012. So far, 858 people have died across 28 countries from the illness, which is marked by a fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

In Southeast Asia, fruit bats were the original hosts of the deadly Nipah virus, which emerged in Malaysia in 1998, then again in India in 2001. The bats passed it to farmed pigs, which gave it to people. Patients experienced headaches and vomiting; many slipped into a coma and died.

Fruit bats in Africa have played a major role in Ebola outbreaks as well. The worst Ebola outbreak in history, however, came from a population of long-fingered bats. More than 11,000 people died in that epidemic from 2013 to 2016.

Bats are prolific virus carriers

Scientists estimate that there are 1,400 living bat species.

""The great diversity of bats also means they host a great diversity of viruses,"" Nancy Simmons, curator of the American Museum of Natural History's mammology department, said during a media briefing on April 22.

Bats harbor a significantly higher proportion of viruses than other mammals, according to a 2017 study. In fact, a 2019 study found that bats carry more than 200 coronaviruses. They're ideal hosts if you're a virus because bats fly across large geographical ranges, transporting diseases as they go without getting sick themselves.

Bats pass these virus to other species via their poop or saliva, and the unwitting intermediaries can transmit the virus to humans in the same way.

A study published in March 2019 predicted that bats would be the source of a new coronavirus outbreak in China.

""It is highly likely that future SARS- or MERS-like coronavirus outbreaks will originate from bats, and there is an increased probability that this will occur in China,"" the researchers wrote at the time.

That's because the majority of coronaviruses — those that affect humans and animals — can be found in China, and many bats ""live near humans in China, potentially transmitting viruses to humans and livestock,"" the authors said.

Millions of people are exposed to zoonotic viruses annually

Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, told NPR in April that his colleagues are ""finding 1 to 7 million people exposed"" to zoonotic viruses in Southeast Asia each year.

""That's the pathway. It's just so obvious to all of us working in the field,"" he said.

Dennis Carroll, former director of US AID's emerging threats division, told Nautilus Magazine in March that research from EcoHealth Alliance suggests ""we're looking at an elevation of spillover events two to three times more than what we saw 40 years earlier.""

That's because of the growing human population and the way we're encroaching on wild areas.

""The single biggest predictor of spillover events is land-use change — more land going to agriculture and more specifically to livestock production,"" Carroll said.

He added, ""whatever future threats we're going to face already exist; they are currently circulating in wildlife.""",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

The concept of herd immunity is to stop the transmission of a virus through mass infection — the more people who have antibodies, the quicker mass immunity to the virus will be reached.

But it remains unknown if there's long-term immunity to COVID-19, and reaching herd immunity could lead to more deaths.

Health officials have called herd immunity dangerous and something that could take years to reach without a vaccine.

Sweden's approach to the novel coronavirus seems to rely on herd immunity, and it has kept businesses open throughout the pandemic.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

As Americans agitate for the reopening the economy in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, some of them are looking at one strategy to make it feasible: herd immunity.

You don't need to look further than Sweden's anti-lockdown experiment to see why that wouldn't work.

Sweden has taken a controversially relaxed approach to COVID-19. It has not initiated a nationwide lockdown to flatten the curve. Instead, Sweden seems to be pinning its hopes on herd immunity to stop the transmission of the virus through mass infection.

The idea is if more people are infected and obtain antibodies, people will eventually gain immunity to the virus. The country has kept restaurants, schools, and gyms open and urged its residents to social distance and wash their hands.

In the US, the Trump administration has refused to set nationwide distancing rules, leading to scattershot lockdown and reopening efforts.

States across the US issued stay-at-home orders in March, and several governors are starting to reopen businesses — which if done too early, could put residents at risk of COVID-19 surges. Some people calling for economic reopenings, as well as anti-vaccine advocates, have pushed for herd immunity as a way out.

But scientists have called it dangerous rhetoric, saying that in the years people would have to wait for herd immunity to be achieved, hundreds of thousands of people could die from COVID-19. And beyond that, it remains unknown if antibodies from COVID-19 even result in long-term immunity.

No country in the world has reached herd immunity to COVID-19

Data suggests that no place has reached herd immunity to the coronavirus — less than 10% of the world has been exposed to the virus, according to estimates.

Experts say herd immunity requires 50 to 70% of the population to be exposed to the virus. Business Insider's Hilary Brueck reported that without a vaccine, it could take four to five years to reach that point.

In those four or five years, hundreds of thousands of more people could die from COVID-19. And scientists are still uncertain if a COVID-19 infection even leads to immunity.

As of Friday morning, Sweden, which has a population of 10.23 million, had 29,207 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 3,646 deaths from the virus — a death rate of 35.64 deaths per 100,000 people.

The US, meanwhile, has had 1.45 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 86,607 deaths from the virus. With a population of 328.2 million, the country has a death rate of 26.3 deaths per 100,000 people.

Health officials have called the concept of herd immunity 'dangerous'

Epidemiologists at Johns Hopkins University have called the concept herd immunity a ""dangerous misconception"" and said the US remains vulnerable to the virus. The World Health Organization also criticized the idea of herd immunity on Monday.

""This idea that, 'Well, maybe countries who had lax measures and haven't done anything will all of a sudden magically reach some herd immunity, and so what if we lose a few old people along the way?' This is a really dangerous, dangerous calculation,"" Mike Ryan, WHO's executive director of health emergencies, said.

Ryan told reporters that humans ""are not herds,"" and such plans around building immunity would lead to only more death.

""I think we need to be really careful when we use terms in this way around natural infections in humans because it can lead to a very brutal arithmetic which does not put people and life and suffering at the center of that equation,"" he said.

The creator of Sweden's coronavirus plan even said he isn't convinced it's working

The architect behind Sweden's coronavirus plan even said he wasn't sure if the relaxed approach is working.

""I'm not convinced at all,"" Anders Tegnell, Sweden's state epidemiologist, told the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet on May 1.

On Tuesday, Sweden even changed one aspect of its COVID-19 strategy, after seeing a high death rate in Swedish nursing homes. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven's office announced it would spend about $220 million (2.2 billion kronor) to help protect elderly people in nursing homes from the novel coronavirus.

Sweden and the US are among the 10 countries with the highest numbers of deaths per capita from COVID-19, according to data from Statista. Based on the data, Canada has nearly half the death rate of the US, at 15.1 deaths per 100,000 people.

Sweden is more densely populated than other Nordic countries, but its neighbors' death rates per capita are much lower — Norway has a rate of 4.32 deaths per 100,000 people, and Finland has a rate of 5.2.

Other nations, including Spain and Italy, have higher death rates per capita than the US and Sweden. Both countries have older populations, which affects the death rate, along with other factors, such as testing availability.

Emily Toth Martin, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health told Business Insider reporter Anna Medaris Miller that the only way to gain herd immunity from the virus is through a vaccine.

""This is not just about getting through the current crisis,"" she added. ""If this virus stays around, we need a vaccine to prevent resurgences in future generations.""",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

In early May, the country announced a 24-hour coronavirus curfew, only allowing residents with identification out to grocery shop by appointment.

The cheapest flights the couple found out of the country were $5,000 each, which was not possible for them.

The US embassy told them it couldn't help at this time.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

When Kuwait announced earlier this month that it was implementing a 24-hour lockdown to stem the spread of the coronavirus, residents flocked to grocery stores by the thousands.

People stood in lines — some blocks long — in heat that exceeded 90 degrees, according to Klement and Linda Camaj, two Americans in Kuwait for work.

Because the announcement fell during Ramadan, when Muslims traditionally fast from sunrise to sunset, some people waiting in the heat fainted, Linda Camaj told Business Insider.

""It was by far the most surreal thing I've ever experienced,"" said Linda, who said she waited in line on May 9 for six hours with her husband.

""I honestly thought the line was for something else,"" Klement said in the phone interview. ""We saw a handful of people pass out, completely passed out ... You have to take into consideration that they are fasting and they can't drink water. They can't eat.""

The Camajs, who both work at the Berlin-based think tank A Path for Europe, traveled to Kuwait City in early March. While news of the coronavirus had already been spreading, the couple thought that Kuwait may be spared from the kind of outbreaks other countries were experiencing.

As the situation got worse and the 24-hour curfew was announced the second week of May, the couple tried to stock up on groceries.

Despite waiting in lines for hours for two days before the lockdown went into effect, the stores closed before they made it inside.

People waited in lines for hours to get groceries ahead of Kuwait's total lockdown. Linda Camaj

Kuwait now allows residents to go grocery shopping by appointment. But because the Camajs are on tourist visas, they can only order delivery. Realizing that delivery would be nearly impossible with such high demand, they attempted to book a flight home, but the cheapest tickets they could find were for $5,000 each, they said.

Unable to pay that, and feeling out of options, they reached out to the US embassy in Kuwait by phone and email, hoping that they could provide the couple with documentation so they could leave the house to get food and drinking water.

The embassy representative asked them whether they had running water and internet, which they do, and then told them that they can either stick it out and wait for more delivery times to be added or pay for the flights home, according to an email viewed by Business Insider. Several phone calls went the same way, they told Business Insider.

The couple was shocked by the government's response.

""Am I going to fry the WiFi router and eat it?"" Klement told Business Insider.

""We would love to be able to go back to New York, we would love to,"" Linda said. ""But we don't have $10,000.""

The couple survived on chips and marshmallows for a day before a friend stepped up to help

After arriving home from two grocery stores on May 9 and 10, sweaty and empty-handed, the couple found snacks around the home to eat.

The 20-day total lockdown is planned to last through May 30, according to Reuters.

""On Monday, we shared a bottle of water, and marshmallows, and chips,"" Klement told Business Insider.

On Tuesday, a friend who lives nearby was able to get an appointment to go shopping and picked up a few items for the couple.

They didn't want to ask their friend to help because people are limited to shop for 30 items each week, so anything their friend bought on their behalf would be one less item for his family, Klement said.

The couple is keeping a tally of the days they have been confined to their apartment. Linda Camaj

The Camajs said that they realize that there are people in the world, including the United States and Kuwait, that are in far worse situations than they are during this pandemic.

While they are uncomfortable, they have been able to make it work, they said.

More than anything, the couple is frustrated with the lack of response from the US Department of State.

Klement said that when a friend from Britain, who is also in Kuwait, found herself in a similar situation her embassy sent groceries to the door.

He wasn't expecting that kind of help from the US State Department, but was hoping that he could be provided with a document that allowed them to leave the apartment to buy food.

The US Department of State didn't immediately return a Business Insider message seeking comment.

""I'm not asking for charity, just give me some sort of paper that lets me buy some food,"" Klement told Business Insider. ""I truly believe the role of my government is safeguarding its citizens.""

Linda and Klement Camaj are continuing to look for flights home

As the total lockdown continues, the couple is continuing to try to order groceries online.

The Kuwaiti government allows people to leave the house to walk between 4:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m., but the streets have been crowded. Many people have been out without masks, which is in violation of the lockdown, Linda said, leaving the couple feeling too unsafe to leave their homes.

Last week Kuwait's Ministry of Health reported that it had registered its first three-digit jump in cases over 24 hours. On Thursday, an additional 947 positive coronavirus cases had been detected over a one day period, bringing the total in the country to 11,975, Al-Monitor reported.

Prior to the lockdown, the cases were in the 7,000 range, Klement said.

The couple feels that the rush to grocery stores over May 9 and 10 are responsible for the uptick.

The couple is beginning to give up trying to go straight home. Instead, they're looking at flights to Sweden or the Netherlands, where they have family. From there, they will look for flights to the US.

The couple said that after unsuccessful talks with the US embassy, they reached out to the Swedish and Dutch embassy. Neither one of them are citizens there, but found the people the reached on the phone to be more helpful to them in terms of offering advice.

""On the other hand, you have the world's greatest superpower that says 'sorry sir there's nothing I can do for you,'"" Klement said, referring to the US. ""I felt like I was calling Verizon.""",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

Be kind. We're all doing the best we can.

It's Friday. Here's good news.

Life in a long pandemic will require titrating risk — not eliminating it and not ignoring it, but understanding it and taking it into account. We're getting better at that.

As Aylin Woodward reports at Insider, it's becoming clear how to stamp out superspreader events. Superspreading tends to occur when an infected person has significant close contact with a group of people from a variety of households — usually in a midsize or large gathering, almost always indoors, usually in a place with limited air circulation. Superspreader events have included parties, religious services, choir practices, and sporting events.

We're starting to see how we can take measures to make ourselves safer — not safe! Americans in vast numbers are doing the right things, even without government orders.

We've all but eliminated large gatherings. Many people are wearing masks, especially indoors. We're washing hands. Businesses are figuring out how to improve air circulation, distance employees, and space out customers.

We're clearly anticipating — and accepting — moderate changes that will alter life until there's a vaccine: less travel, less mass entertainment, less gathering. And we're recognizing that these changes will savage some parts of the economy, like air travel, and cause massive adaptation in other parts, like dining out.

The fundamental conflicts in society — economic, political, racial — haven't been healed by the pandemic, and probably have been exaggerated. Americans are anxious. Their jobs and livelihoods are in danger. So it's not surprising that we're seeing brawls over masking and armed protests about lockdowns.

But the vast majority of us seek the same goal. We want to keep our loved ones safe from illness and be able to work and play. Except for a few people on the edges, there are no lockdown zealots who want to keep the country in cold storage forever and no reopen crazies who want to murder your grandmother.

We're all in the murky middle, and now that we've been through the initial panic and know what we need to do to prevent death on a vast scale, we're ready for an ambiguous next stage.

Our federal government has not really done its part to prepare and equip us, and that's tragic. But as citizens, we are all in the same boat. We're aware of the small and medium measures that will reduce risk — and the overwhelming majority of us are taking them.

Michael Brendan Dougherty puts this all beautifully in the National Review. We're not in a culture war, he says. Most of us are just trying to do what's right. So let's thank each other, and be generous:

""We are all muddling through, trying to live the best we can while this threat is out there. We are tempted to take out the frustration, anxiety, and anger these months have generated on each other. But what most of us need now is the mercy of basic kindness.""

Trump's Postal Service attack on Amazon is wrong

Postal agencies globally are carrying more packages than letters. But, it's companies like UPS, FedEx, and Amazon who have truly seen a boon from e-commerce and the explosion of parcel volumes. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

President Trump, who has never hidden his rage at The Washington Post and its owner, Jeff Bezos, who is also the CEO of Amazon, now appears to have taken his campaign to harm Bezos to another, more disturbing level. The US Postal Service, now stacked with Trump-appointed officials, will review what it charges huge package shippers — notably Amazon — perhaps as a prelude to hiking those rates and raising Amazon's costs.

The USPS's last-mile contracts with Amazon and others may well be mediocre contracts — there are lots of smart arguments on both sides of the issue — but the salient fact here is that the president has shown zero interest in the US Postal Service except insofar as it's a club to bash Amazon. You may remember that two years ago Trump personally tried to strong-arm the then postmaster general into doubling rates on Amazon.

And of course that's not the only example of Trump's malice toward Bezos and Amazon. The Defense Department and Amazon are still fighting over a $10 billion cloud-computing contract that was seemingly yanked from Amazon after Trump made it clear he didn't want Amazon to get it.

It's ridiculous to even have to say this, but it's wrong for a president to be picking winners and losers in any market. And it's monumentally wrong for the president to unleash the government against a private citizen because he owns a newspaper that sometimes criticizes him.

So far Bezos hasn't reined in the Post. He has stood up to attacks that have cost him and his shareholders billions of dollars. Not every media owner has the deep pockets and the courage to do that.

In the depths of Watergate, President Richard Nixon threatened the broadcasting licenses owned by then Washington Post owner Katharine Graham. What Trump is doing to Bezos and Amazon is worse. —DP

Beware 'pre-print' studies, especially when they appear to confirm your political biases

The world is studying and learning about the coronavirus in real time. Perhaps never before in history have so many researchers been so focused on the same topic at the same time. And perhaps never before have so many ""pre-print"" studies been released and mined for information.

What's a ""pre-print""? It's an early draft of a study that will be revised as it gets analyzed by other experts, the ""peer review"" process that acts as a quality-control mechanism in science and academia.

In normal times, preliminary studies are often shared only with peers. But now, given the extreme time sensitivity, many coronavirus pre-print studies are being published everywhere, and their initial findings widely discussed and distributed.

This is especially true when the initial findings appear to confirm the beliefs or hopes of a particular political team, with a built-in base of fans and amplifiers.

For example, The New York Times dives into what happened last month when a Stanford pre-print study was published that appeared to confirm the beliefs and hopes of some conservatives.

The study concluded that coronavirus infections were much more widespread than everyone believed — 85 times as widespread actually. If this finding had held up under scrutiny, it would have been excellent news. It would have meant that many more people had already been exposed to the coronavirus than everyone thought, and, therefore, that we as a society were much closer to ""herd immunity."" It might also have meant that the coronavirus was much less dangerous than everyone thought.

These initial findings also happened to fit the narrative that was popular with right-leaners — namely, that the coronavirus panic was, at best, ""dumb,"" and, at worst, a liberal hoax. Lockdowns weren't necessary, this story went. They were a gigantic overkill regulation pushed by members of a hyperactive Democratic nanny state. They were a cure that was worse than the disease.

As Aleszu Bajak and Jeff Howe of The New York Times explain, the initial findings of the study were seized on and shared by conservative commentators.

But, at the same time, peers of the scientists who published the study argued that the Stanford team had made some questionable assumptions that did not hold up under scrutiny. Within a day or two, in fact, it became clear that the study had overestimated the likely infection rate.

Experts still believe the number of actual coronavirus infections vastly outnumbers the number of confirmed infections. But the difference is likely far less extreme than the Stanford study initially suggested.

The same thing has happened with pre-print studies that confirm the ""prior"" or desired beliefs of left-wing commentators.

The rapid publication of pre-print studies are critical and helpful right now. The faster scientists can learn from each other and fact-check each other's work, the faster we will collectively learn about the coronavirus and how to best protect ourselves from it.

But everyone should keep in mind that pre-print means ""preliminary and subject to change."" —HB

How speaking transmits the coronavirus: Some of the droplets you emit when you talk hang in the air for 8 to 14 minutes

A new study — an edited study in a journal, not a pre-print — measured how long ""respiratory droplets"" hang in the air after people talk in an enclosed space with no ventilation.

The answer? As long as 14 minutes.

The experimenters had someone repeat the phrase ""stay healthy"" for 25 seconds in an enclosed room with stagnant air. They then measured how long it took the tiny speech droplets to evaporate or fall to a surface.

Speaking of speaking ... some Wisconsin residents celebrated the ending of coronavirus restrictions by heading for places that fit the description for 'superspreader' environments described above — bars

Owner Michael Mattson toasts the re-opening of the Friends and Neighbors bar following the Wisconsin Supreme Court's decision to strike down Governor Tony Evers' safer-at-home order against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Appleton, Wisconsin, U.S. May 13, 2020. William Glasheen/USA TODAY NETWORK via REUTERS

One effective way to transmit the coronavirus is to get close to someone in an enclosed indoor space with poor ventilation and speak loudly close to their face for a while.

In Seoul, South Korea, for example, the country's reopening was put on hold after a single ""spreader"" visited three nightclubs on a single night. South Korea has already traced 153 new infections, primary and secondary, to this one night on the town.

So for the sake of Wisconsinites, let's hope that no asymptomatic residents were among those who decided to celebrate by hitting the bars. —HB

I cannot think of a single state where the governor has over-reached. My own state (North Carolina) has been very cautious and as a result we are nearing a decent plateau while remaining mostly closed. My point is there is little evidence of governors trying to ""grab"" power — most of them are making anguished decisions every day and their poll numbers are extremely high.

There do not have to be ""two sides"" to this. There is truth, there is science. Decisions are not easy since nobody knows everything about this novel virus, but the experts are amazingly consistent in their public health advice. Suggestions such as the one you made only serve to bolster the concept of there being two sides. I found it disappointing — I could hear that on Fox News any day of the week.

Protesting truck drivers interrupted a White House press conference on the coronavirus on Friday.

President Donald Trump took a moment away from discussing efforts to produce a vaccine to praise the drivers, calling their protest a ""sign of love.""

""Do you hear that outside, that beautiful sound?"" Trump said. ""Those are truckers that are with us all the way.

""They're protesting in favor of President Trump, as opposed to against him,"" he added. ""Hundreds of trucks out there. And that's the sign of love, not the sign of your typical protest. So I want to thank our great truckers. They like me, and I like them. We're working on something together.""

Trump made similar comments on a Thursday interview with Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo as truck horns drowned out their conversation. Bartiromo clarified that the horns came from truck drivers who were protesting, and Trump pushed back.

""Well, they're not protesters,"" Trump said. ""They're supporters of me because we are getting things for the truckers, and all those great truckers that are all over the country. They're honking and they're really very thankful that I'm president frankly.""

Why truck drivers are protesting

The truck drivers were, in fact, protesting rock-bottom rates, not celebrating Trump. Since mid-April, drivers in Texas, California, Arizona, and Washington, DC, have taken to the streets in their big rigs to demand government support.

April rates for spot-market loads — trucking jobs tendered in real time rather than through a prearranged contract — were 54% lower than in April 2019, according to data from the load-board company DAT. Rates in April fell to five-year lows for refrigerated and flatbed loads.

Meanwhile, the $2 trillion stimulus bill that Trump signed into law in late March did not provide any direct support for truck drivers. Several truck drivers who applied for a loan through the Small Business Administration told Business Insider that they were not able to get funding, putting their livelihoods at risk.

For Joe Plummer, the pay to take a truckload of goods from his home base in North Carolina to Los Angeles had plummeted to $2,700 from $4,700 two months ago.

""We don't need memes and news conferences saying 'We support truckers,'"" Plummer previously told Business Insider. ""We need fuel to stay low, rates to go up, and some type of financial assistance until we recover.""

There are nearly 2 million truck drivers in the US. About 350,000 to 400,000 of them own and operate their own trucks, while many work for small companies in need of financial assistance.

Cass Information Systems said April freight volumes hit levels not seen since 2009, obliterating take-home pay for drivers.

Trump has pledged to help truck drivers, but some say they are just a 'political toy'

While Trump said truck drivers loved him, their relationship has been a bit rocky in recent years. Several blamed Trump in 2019 for destroying their livelihoods as his trade war lowered US manufacturing output.

Trump has rallied behind truck drivers in recent weeks. He told ""Fox & Friends"" earlier this month that truck drivers were being ""price gouged"" by the brokers who match them with retailers and manufacturers, adding that he was ""going to take care of them.""

Some drivers, however, have expressed their frustration that Trump is using them as ""a political toy.""

""You're a political toy! Placated and being used,"" trucking activist Charles Claburn wrote on Facebook, as reported by Transportation Nation Nework. ""You leave that street (and) it's over. We need more trucks. They see us, now they need to hear us! There needs to be a clear ultimatum sent by this industry they have 6 weeks to deliver the promises, if not in writing, then it's time to do it right.""

Until changes are made, truck drivers like Plummer don't know whether they'll keep working at all.

""We are risking our health and lives to take rates that wouldn't pay for our business,"" he said.

Shops, restaurants, nail salons, cinemas, barbershops, tanning salons, and beaches in Texas are open to the public.

On Monday, gyms, offices, and nonessential manufacturing facilities will be added to the list.

Gov. Greg Abbott is expected to announce additional plans for reopening gyms and childcare facilities.

Some in Texas feel that they don't have a choice, from a financial standpoint, but to resume business.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Less than two weeks after its stay-at-home order expired, Texas has reported its largest daily increase in new coronavirus cases and deaths.

Coronavirus-related deaths hit a low of 12 on Tuesday, but by Thursday, the state saw 58 new deaths and 1,448 new cases.

Texas is one of a handful of states that have begun easing coronavirus restrictions: Shops, restaurants, nail salons, movie theaters, barbershops, tanning salons, churches, and beaches are open to the public. People are still encouraged to maintain social distance, wear face masks, and wash their hands frequently.

Gov. Greg Abbott has defended the fast clip at which the state is resuming business, saying its death and hospitalization rates are lower than in other states of similar size, such as Florida and California, The Associated Press reported. Texas had 44,485 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,235 deaths as of Friday.

So far, Texas has conducted 623,284 coronavirus tests, which is about on par with Florida's testing but lower than California's 1.1 million tests, according to the COVID Tracking Project.

Abbott's goal is to open Texas fully.

Gyms, offices, and nonessential manufacturing facilities are slated to open on Monday, but social distancing is still required, and none of them can exceed 25% of their maximum capacity. At gyms, showers and locker areas will be off-limits, equipment must be sanitized after each use, and gloves are mandatory.

Abbott is expected on Monday to announce when and how bars and childcare facilities can resume business.

In Austin, restaurant owners have been tasked with maintaining logs of customers to help with contact tracing if needed. They also know that health officials might call them out in the case of an outbreak, The AP reported.

Eric Silverstein, who owns The Peached Tortilla, said he and others in the restaurant industry should be willing to do whatever it takes to open back up.

""We have no choice,"" he told The AP. ""You kind of have to go back to doing some form of business.""

But not everyone shared the sentiment.

Suzanne Daniels, who owns the Brentwood Social House, told The AP that she wasn't trying to compete with restaurants that are offering indoor seating. She doesn't know when she'll feel safe enough to do so, she added.

""It feels early,"" Daniels said. ""In my gut, it doesn't feel right or good.""

Other states, including Wisconsin and Georgia, have also relaxed restrictions, though Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious-disease expert, warned Congress of ""needless suffering and death"" if the US reopens prematurely.

The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center projected that Dallas County could experience an uptick of 800 new cases every day by early July if containment measures are flouted, The Dallas Morning News reported.

Texas is also experiencing friction between state and local authorities. Attorney General Ken Paxton censured officials in Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio for enforcing restrictions that are stricter than what Abbott has implemented statewide for Texas. The cities have been threatened with lawsuits if they don't ease up, The AP reported.

""Unfortunately, a few Texas counties and cities seem to have confused recommendations with requirements and have grossly exceeded state law to impose their own will on private citizens and businesses,"" Paxton told The AP.

In El Paso, county judge Ricardo Samaniego requested that Abbott wait until the number of cases are declining and closely consider data before further lifting restrictions. He's still awaiting a reply, according to The AP, but doesn't expect it to come before Monday's announcement.

""I'm not fighting his plan; I'm fighting his timing,"" Samaniego told The AP. ""It looks like it would work for us months from now.""

Abbott, for his part, points to the fact that overflow hospitals in Dallas and Houston were never used. That's an indicator that Texas' healthcare system wasn't overwhelmed, he said.

The results of Texas' reopening — and the effects in other states — aren't yet fully known, since the coronavirus has a lag time, Fauci said in April.

New cases and hospitalizations reported today are a reflection of the coronavirus' spread two weeks ago because the average incubation period is five days, and symptoms worsen over a week or two. Then after a person gets tested, it takes a few days for results to come back, which then must be reported to local and state health authorities. If someone is hospitalized, it may take many more days before they get dangerously sick or die.

That's why the White House guidelines advise states to see a 14-day ""downward trajectory"" in cases before they reopen, The New York Times reported.

If a state's new infections aren't dropping, it could still start reopening as long as the proportion of test results that come back positive is lower than it was two weeks ago (assuming as many or more tests are administered).

""They see the decline going in, and they pat themselves on the back and say, 'Look at the good work we've done. Now we can let this happen and open up things,'"" Dennis Perrotta, a retired state epidemiologist in Texas, told The AP. ""And then we get slammed with a second peak.""

I started getting short of breath. So definitely does attack your respiratory system and it hits it hard. So I think like, that was one of the worst symptoms, because I woke up in the middle of the night and I was disoriented. I wasn't able to breathe.

I wasn't able to get anybody's attention. And I think at that point you started sitting down and having a conversation with yourself. Like, OK, this is it for me. This is it for me and my children. I won't ever see them again-type of thing. But I thank God that he was with me. Was able to wake him up, wake my husband up to let them know that something wasn't right.

When I first got here, they wasn't going to test me because I didn't fit the criteria. After some CAT scans and a couple of tests, they decided to go ahead and test me. And they came back and they told me that I tested positive.

My family is on 14-day quarantine. I haven't seen my children, haven't seen my husband in days now.

There is no treatment for coronavirus. So what they're treating is, they can treat a symptom. So if I have a fever, they could treat it with Tylenol. If I have a cough, they could treat you with cough medicine. But my body has to fight it off. So I have to take the time to rest, make sure that I'm trying to keep down as much food as I can and let my body do its job.

I've been here, I think I lost about 15 pounds, so I don't know what I'll be looking like when I get up out of here. I got to get my hair done y'all. Talk about my bonnet.

Everybody's making jokes about it. I don't take it personal. I think the only thing that kind of bothered me was to see myself on the news, to see my local news station speak of this situation but not even know wholeheartedly like what was going on.

It's a lot scarier when you see it on the TV or when you read about it than what it actually is. But I'm not going to sit up here and pretend like it's a joke. Definitely has taken me away from my family, gave me some breathing problems, and sat me down for a while to reevaluate myself and kind of, you know, my life. I know after this, you know, I want to get out and do more.

So just make sure that you guys are keeping your kids safe and you're keeping yourself safe as well. That's the best advice that I can give anybody. Just make sure to y'all are paying attention to your body. Your body will let you know when something's wrong, and if it's telling you something is wrong, then go ahead and get tested.

Unlike other colds and the flu that I had, there was no headache, no sneezing, no sniffles, no sore throat, no body aches, and even with that high fever, no chills and sweats that usually get that hot and cold.

Biocontainment was weird. I spent 10 days in there. I was hooked up to all kinds of monitors.

Anyone entering my biocontainment, it was like Neil Armstrong landing on the moon. They had full biocontainment suits on, three layers of gloves, a motor in their back to provide air, duct tape all around, sealing off anything that could possibly expose themselves.

But there was nothing they could give me other than ibuprofen and gallons and gallons of Gatorade. I kid that I had been through every flavor of the rainbow of Gatorade multiple amounts of times. The light blue is the bomb. Stay away from the grape. That's nasty.

We were out there, there was a lot of hate that came at us. There were some very elaborate death threats that mounted and got worse as the days progressed, as people learned that the State Department was going to allow us back to the States.

All along we were making lemonade out of lemons, looking at the glass half full, not half empty, living for the present, not worrying about the past, and also not focusing on the future because all of that was out of our control.

Stress is the biggest, biggest contributor to battling the immune system, and it's not good for the immune system. So keeping our stress level down was important.

It feels quite surreal to be part of this huge thing, actually. I step back, and realize that I see it on the news and it just dominates the headlines everywhere.

Other states have joined them in relaxing stay-at-home orders, including Colorado, Oklahoma, Montana, Mississippi, Indiana, and Alaska.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is also allowing certain regions of the state to begin reopening on May 16.

The US is seeing sustained plateaus of coronavirus cases, but more Americans are still dying from COVID-19 per week than from any other common cause of death.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Around 95% of Americans were under lockdown in April to help curb the spread of the coronavirus. And it was working, as the US began seeing sustained declining plateaus of new cases.

But as federal social distancing guidelines expired at the end of April, more than half of US states began reopening.

Now, there are already talks of relieving the economic pain brought on by the lockdown — but reopening the economy might look different for every state and is likely to be done in phases.

That's because reopening plans are dependent on various factors, like controlling the rate of infections and hospitalizations, making testing and contact tracing more widespread, making sure healthcare facilities are properly equipped to handle another resurgence, and employing social distancing practices in the workplace.

Several reopening plans, such as those laid out by the Trump administration and by researchers with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said that a state should see a declining number of new cases for at least two weeks before reopening. It's a threshold that most states haven't hit yet, The New York Times reported the first week of May.

Some states are already making moves to begin reopening parts of their economies, even as more Americans die from COVID-19 per week than from any other common cause of death, according to data analysis by Business Insider. Some, including Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina, were among the last to issue stay-at-home orders, doing so in April after many other states already had in March.

In fact, in several of the states that have begun to reopen, the number of new cases of COVID-19 seem to still be steadily rising. Where most cases early in the outbreak were reported primarily in urban areas like New York and Seattle, recent analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation indicates that from April 13 to April 27, rural counties saw an average 125% increase in new coronavirus infections, leaping from 51 to 115 new cases per 100,000 people.

After initially reopening his state, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves slowed his 'back to normal' plans on May 1 when the state reported 397 new cases and 20 new deaths that day, its highest daily numbers to date.

On May 7, the Associated Press reported that the Trump administration had halted the publication of new CDC research and safety guidelines for states attempting to reopen their economies, regarding how local schools, places of worship, restaurants, and health facilities should handle social distancing. The document was pulled because of the Trump administration's ongoing preference that states assume the responsibility to determine their own reopening requirements, and that the federal government should be the ""last resort"" for states that need coronavirus testing support, per the AP.

Coronavirus will change the healthcare industry forever, and we must be there for nurses in the aftermath.

Nurses have banded together to develop a successful COVID-19 playbook to effectively combat it on the frontlines.

But with that will come long-term health impacts, and we should establish wellness opportunities to assist their recovery.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

There are defining moments in all of our lives — moments that have the ability to fundamentally alter a person, process, and organization. COVID-19 is one of those moments. And, if we have learned anything from this crisis, it is how truly awe-inspiring the strength of our combined team members can be when faced with the unknown.

Our nurses, and others, have endured unique war-like circumstances since the first week in March. One confirmed case turned into a thousand within mere days. Empathic and compassionate caregivers were turned into combatants who had to face ""the invisible enemy."" Our response was courageous, having to put aside our fears for ourselves and our loved ones, to answer the call to action. Ingenuity, creativity, and fortitude forced us to think differently and change care models as patient statuses rapidly deteriorated. Had our team members not been there, the numbers of casualties would have been far greater, which can't be underscored enough.

This newfound sense of camaraderie has made us stronger, with an enhanced ability to move swiftly and adapt to ever-changing situations.

COVID-19's playbook continues to be written by nursing teams throughout the continuum of care. When the patients present in the emergency department, we are now able to distinguish the early signs and differences between the coronavirus and the flu. We know how to treat less severe cases, advising them when to return to hospitals if their condition worsens. We know which respiratory treatments work, how they should be delivered, and how often. We also know that proning patients can be the difference between intubation and regular oxygen.

Unfortunately, we've been conditioned to the dramatic, intense, and long workdays. But even the hardest of situations come to an end. We've turned a corner and entered a stage where each ""code"" called overheard during the pandemic's early days has been replaced by chiming bells for a patient who was extubated, or hearing The Beatles' ""Here Comes the Sun"" when patients are discharged.

Distress has transitioned into perseverance, evidenced in the smiling eyes visible through a nurse's mask as they line our hallways to celebrate key moments in this fight. This is what resilience and hope looks like.

The stark truth is that nurses won't come out of this unscathed. We already have a greater appreciation for humanity and the fragility of life. Empathy and compassion have not changed. Neither has our mission. But what will be the pandemic's final toll on nurses?

During times of decompression and reflection, fears, anxieties, and concerns will arise. There will be physical and mental health issues, too, both of which need to be quickly identified and remedied.

It's the time of year when weekends begin to fill up with summer festivals, concerts, barbeques, and fairs. But with just a few states in the beginning phases of reopening, most Americans will have to wait for bass-booming and funnel cakes to return to their neighborhoods.

The founders of The Bronx Night Market, a free foodie festival in New York City on the last Saturday of the summer months, are among the millions of entrepreneurs left in limbo, waiting for a return to normalcy. As shelter-in-place orders remain throughout New York City, the season is at a standstill.

In the meantime, founders Amanda Celestino and Marco Shalma are planning their next move and staying in touch with their community, all while supporting small businesses through the pandemic. They host live trivia and happy-hour events on Instagram, and they're sending daily email newsletters to their 25,000 subscribers. The founders are also working with local government to advocate for the small businesses in their community and encourage locals to continue ordering takeout.

Celestino and Shalma remain optimistic, so they've been preparing for the weekend when New Yorkers can finally get back out to socialize — though at that time, attendees may be fewer and farther apart.

Here are the steps The Bronx Night Market founders are taking to engage with their community despite social distancing and the plan to reopen when New York City gets a little ""normal"" back.

Email newsletters invite two-way communication

Part of the team's communication strategy is year-round outreach to engage its foodie community, highlight its vendors and promote local businesses. ""We don't act as if we were a seasonal series,"" Shalma said.

At a time when The Bronx Night Market can't connect with its audience through in-person events, this consistent digital commuicatio is key. A daily email newsletter with 25,000 subscribers spotlights a local restaurant or vendor, gives recipes to make at home, and links directly to merch like tees and hats. It also provides updates on how The Bronx Night Market is helping other businesses during COVID-19.

The founders say they prefer email marketing to actively engage people in a deeper way than a passive swipe up or double-tap on social media. ""There's an action to be made, somebody has to open the email, somebody has to click on that to even delete it,"" Shalma said. ""If you don't have that two-way communication, your brand might as well be dead.""

Without strong marketing, tens of thousands of people wouldn't have gathered in Fordham Plaza for The Bronx Night Market throughout the last two summers. The company uses bright and playful graphics. Its Instagram page is full of ""food porn,"" starring melted cheese, saucy meat, and gooey chocolate.

Shalma said it's important for brands to be ahead of the curve. ""If you're following a trend, you're too late,"" he said.

A post shared by Bronx Night Market (@bronxnightmarket) Apr 5, 2020 at 3:00pm PDT

Celestino said it was key to find a strong brand identity and voice early on, to then follow that consistently so people would know what to expect. ""We were able to find more people who resonated with it, and build a community around that,"" she said.

And that identity isn't just about visuals. Other than Shalma, the mostly part-time and volunteer team is female, which Celestino said is a strength that's helped them connect with their 68% female audience. ""We are all about women empowerment and female entrepreneurship and bettering our communities through that voice,"" she said.

'Small businesses are a big f---ing deal'

Without a definite date to reopen The Bronx Night Market, the two founders' main mission during the pandemic became helping small business owners in their area, especially those who depend on seasonal events and festivals for the majority of their income.

They created an online guide with over 700 local restaurants and vendors offering take-out and specials. They made t-shirts that say ""small businesses are a big f---ing deal"" to donate the proceeds to small business owners and employees in their community.

The founders are surveying business owners to identify and communicate major pain points to local government. They're working directly with Senator Alessandra Biaggi to advocate for those who haven't received PPP loans, unemployment benefits, or SBA disaster loans. They also hope to ease permits and regulations to allow vendors to sell in city streets, parks, and plazas.

Planning for extended hours, lower capacity, more spacing

The founders have a gameplan to reopen as soon as the government allows large gatherings again. First, they'll have to cut their max capacity down to 500 to make room for social distancing, though they don't expect this will impact the total number of attendees. To accommodate the demand, they'll extend the hours of the market and create a schedule of two-hour time slots.

""It's going to be scaled down, but we know that we're going to go a little bit bigger to make sure that it's more attractive, it's more fun, and it's effective as well,"" Shalma said.

They also plan to limit the number of vendors to 20, so they can space them 15 feet apart. They'll also space seating areas farther apart, clean seats and tables regularly, add hand-washing and sanitizing stations, and use barricades and trained volunteers to help with crowd control.

The founders said they've always held their vendors to high cleaning and operating standards, but they plan to host a webinar to train vendors, their team, and their suppliers on their new solutions and operating procedures.

Celestino said she's confident people will be anxious to get out of their homes and socialize from a safe distance once New York lifts its stay-at-home order, which Governor Cuomo has extended through June 13.

""We know that the minute the large-gathering ban is lifted and it is safe, we are ready to come back,"" she said. ""I think we'll see more attendees than we've ever seen before.""

Shalma said it's their responsibility to open the market as soon as they can. ""Don't forget we're in New York and even more than that, we're in the Bronx and people are resilient. We don't have the luxury of being in large homes,"" he said. ""This is our livelihood.""",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

But some of the top firms in the country, including Kirkland & Ellis, Davis Polk, Cravath, and Sidley Austin, are moving summer associate programs online, partly or fully, and cutting them short.

Many of the most profitable firms are paying students for the full length of the program – more than $3,600 per week – even if they're shortening it.

Less profitable firms tend to be pro-rating pay, or offering stipends or advances, causing some summer associates to stress about their finances.

The top law firms in the US tend to have a regimented hiring process that has been drastically disrupted by the coronavirus, leaving hundreds of rising lawyers with little to do this summer – even if they're still getting paid $3,600 a week.

Summer associate programs are a rite of passage for thousands of law students wrapping up their second, or 2L, year in law school. The recruiting process for such roles starts in the fall of the 2L year, and most summers can expect to eventually get an offer for full-time work once they graduate, assuming they pass the bar exam after their 3L year.

The pandemic has led to delays throughout the process, however. States including New York and California have canceled the July bar exam, and several law firms that normally start their first-years in the fall have said they won't be onboarding the incoming class until some point in 2021.

Law firms that typically start their programs in May – like Davis Polk & Wardwell, which had planned to have 133 summer associates worldwide starting on May 4 – are delaying them to June or July.

Read more: Big Law M&A work is evaporating as coronavirus spreads, but some firms are about to make bank. Here are the winners and losers.

Most are trimming them down to six, four, or even two weeks and moving them online, at least to start. Cravath, Swaine & Moore is starting its six-week program virtually on June 15, although it's possible that it may transition to the office. And Sidley Austin, whose program will run from July 6 to July 31, has told summers that it will still pay them for 10 weeks and is designing a ""robust and engaging"" virtual program

One reason firms say they're cutting back is because the social aspect of the summer associate experience – a big part of it — is hard to replicate virtually. Kevin Iredell, a spokesman for law firm Lowenstein Sandler, said the firm's summers traditionally go to happy hours, dinners, a cruise around Manhattan and a Major League Baseball game. But the MLB has indefinitely delayed the start of its season, and bans on large gatherings have all but eliminated prospects for dining out.

""Right now it'll be mostly virtual, but we're still holding out hope that we'll be able to host some in-person events,"" Iredell said in an email. ""That will all be dependent on the state restrictions.""

Another compelling reason to cut back on summer programs is financial. Law firms large and small have already trimmed salaries and furloughed staff and lawyers. While summers might have hoped to spend more time doing supervised legal work – drafting memos and the like – some firms just don't think it's worth the investment of time.

""Most in-house legal teams do not allow law firms to charge for summer students, nor first-year associates,"" Nancey Watson, a legal pricing consultant, said in an email.

One of the strongest predictors of which law firms are offering their summers full pay is the firm's profit per equity partner, or PPEP. Many of the firms that are promising to pay their summers in full, regardless of the length of the program, netted more than $3 million per equity partner last year. Less profitable firms have been more likely to shrink pay to match the shorter programs or to provide a small stipend, although there have been exceptions.

The cuts can be difficult for some rising lawyers – many of whom are in the midst of final exams – to handle. On online forums like Reddit and TopLawSchools, they fret about canceling leases and paying debts with far less income than they'd budgeted for. Some say they've managed to find research-assistant work with professors, while others are still looking for other sources of income.

One summer associate at a large law firm whose expected income was cut by more than $20,000 told Business Insider he's considering taking on additional work in a grocery store or a warehouse to make up for it.

For summer associates who are more financially secure, boredom could become an issue. At Kirkland & Ellis, the country's top-grossing firm, which last year had more than 300 summer associates, what for many was a 10-week program has been trimmed to just two weeks of virtual programming. They are still being paid for the original length of their commitment.

Kirkland and some other firms that have shortened or canceled their summer programs are also trying to assuage summers' concerns by guaranteeing that they'll have a job at the firm once they graduate.

Many firms are encouraging their rising lawyers to volunteer. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett has trimmed its 10-week program to five weeks online, and it will pay summers for eight weeks. But it will also tack on a $7,500 stipend – just over two weeks' worth of pay – for summers who commit to pro bono legal work, like helping poor criminal defendants, or other volunteering, like food drives, it told summers in an email seen by Business Insider.

""Our hope is that each of our summer associates will contribute in a safe and positive way to their communities, or other communities in need, as we all look for ways to ease the burden brought on by the pandemic,"" the email said.

Nathan Peart, a recruiter at Major, Lindsey & Africa, said many firms are trying to structure pro bono opportunities on top of their virtual programming. He said law firms can't replicate the ""natural connections"" that can happen in an office, but are still trying to build bonds with summer associates by setting up one-on-one conversations with lawyers and other mentorship activities.

Even in an ideal recovery scenario, she says, we'll need to practice careful social distancing, use personal protective equipment, and reduce the number of people in a given workspace.

The main coronavirus tests available are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody testing; each of them have their issues that managers should be aware of if they choose to use them.

PCR leads to a lot of false negatives, meaning you should test employees often. Antibody tests can test for immunity, but not the strength or length of it.

As many businesses face reopening, they are pondering ways to keep their workplaces safe. For many, the question of testing is top of mind. Should they offer testing? If yes, given all the concerns on test reliability, what kind of testing should they offer? Furthermore, who should be tested and how often?

In an ideal world, we would have rapid, highly reliable, relatively inexpensive tests available that would let us know who was currently infected. We would also, in theory, have accurate antibody testing, to tell us who was recently infected and potentially immune. Based on these types of tests, only those without current infection and/or evidence of previous infection or immunity would be allowed to return to work. This would decrease the likelihood of viral transmission in the workplace.

But even in that ideal scenario, we would still need to practice enhanced infection control by continuing to maintain at least six feet apart between workers, reducing the number of staff working at any given time, using masks or other protective equipment where close contact is impossible to avoid, and more.

Symptomatic employees should be immediately excluded from entering the workplace, as should close contacts. And re-testing should occur periodically, at least for some initial length of time, to ensure that infection control measures are working.

Unfortunately, we are far from this ideal scenario. The main tests that are available as of the writing of this article are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody testing, both of which either have challenges with sensitivity (the ability to detect true positives) or specificity (the ability to detect true negatives).

Here are what the two tests are, the problems with each, and how employers should use them.

1. PCR tests and the danger of high false negative rates

COVID-19 PCR tests directly test for the presence of the COVID-19 virus. This test is usually obtained by a nasal or throat swab, and just recently the FDA approved saliva testing. PCR testing indicates whether a patient is infected at the time of testing.

In theory, PCR testing of employees could help employers know who was currently infected. Infected employees would then isolate at home, according to the latest CDC guidelines, and those who were not infected could return to the workplace. In essence, the worksite would reopen virus-free.

Sounds straightforward, right? Unfortunately, the nasal or throat swab PCR test can have a false negative rate of up to 30%. That means for every 100 employees who are infected with the virus, 30 would be missed and could then spread the virus to others when let back into the worksite.

Here's what employers should do if they choose to use PCR testing:

Protect your high-risk employees. Knowing that you might miss up to 30% of people who are carrying the virus, it is especially important to keep high-risk people working from home, along with people who live with or care for high-risk individuals. Start by bringing back only low-risk employees who test negative for the virus. Another option might be to require two negative tests which are 24-plus hours apart, to reduce the chance of a false negative.

Knowing that you might miss up to 30% of people who are carrying the virus, it is especially important to keep high-risk people working from home, along with people who live with or care for high-risk individuals. Start by bringing back only low-risk employees who test negative for the virus. Another option might be to require two negative tests which are 24-plus hours apart, to reduce the chance of a false negative. Re-test every 14 to 28 days. Testing cannot be one and done. PCR testing only tells you if you are infected at one point in time. So, if you get infected a few days after you took the test, you may falsely assume you are still free and clear. And we are learning more and more that people can be asymptomatic with COVID-19, and still spread the virus. Therefore, the best thing to do is retest those employees who are coming to the office, every one to two incubation periods (14 to 28 days), to ensure that they are still negative.

Therefore, the best thing to do is retest those employees who are coming to the office, every one to two incubation periods (14 to 28 days), to ensure that they are still negative. Budget accordingly. Cost may certainly become an issue as a result of re-testing. Some employers may consider testing a random sample of employees to reduce costs.

2. Antibody testing cannot determine who is immune or not with certainty — yet

Antibody (serology) tests measure the presence of virus-fighting antibodies that indicate immunity. These tests require a blood sample, either through a blood draw or in some cases a finger prick. Unlike PCR tests, which detect the presence of the virus itself, serology tests show whether an individual has ever had the virus. In theory, the presence of these antibodies indicates a person has a low likelihood of being infected again.

However, we do not yet know the degree of immunity that people could have from these tests. Initial animal studies do suggest that protective antibodies are produced, but there isn't much human data yet. There have been some reports that antibodies from the plasma of people who have recovered from COVID-19 can help severely ill COVID-19 patients. This suggests that human antibodies, at least initially, do effectively fight the novel coronavirus, but more rigorous studies are needed.

In addition, we need to learn how long COVID-19-protective antibodies last. Antibodies to seasonal, common-cold coronavirus have been found to decline steadily within a year of being infected, so some people can be re-infected a year later. But with the coronavirus that caused SARS in the early 2000's, immunity was found to last for up to three years. We don't yet know what pattern will emerge with this novel coronavirus.

Another issue is with the testing itself. There are accuracy concerns with some of the antibody tests currently on the market. One major worry is a potentially high rate of false positives, depending on the manufacturer. A false positive result might wrongly give someone the impression that they have already had the virus and are producing antibodies to it (at least in the short term).

Here's what employers should do if they choose to offer antibody testing:

Vet the test carefully . Ask testing companies specifically for their false positive rates and for information on any independent evaluations that have been conducted on their tests.

. Ask testing companies specifically for their false positive rates and for information on any independent evaluations that have been conducted on their tests. Protect your high-risk employees. Knowing that you might have some falsely positive employees, keep people at high-risk for severe COVID-19 related illness working from home, along with those who share a home with high-risk individuals. Or consider doing PCR testing too, to see if anyone might have an active infection despite having a positive antibody test.

Knowing that you might have some falsely positive employees, keep people at high-risk for severe COVID-19 related illness working from home, along with those who share a home with high-risk individuals. Or consider doing PCR testing too, to see if anyone might have an active infection despite having a positive antibody test. Re-test every two to four months. Even if the antibody test you choose is relatively accurate, we still don't know how long these antibodies last. So, the best thing to do is retest those employees who are coming to the office, to ensure that they are still producing antibodies. Again, costs are a consideration, which can be addressed by testing a random sample of the employee population.

Newer tests have recently come online, such as rapid antigen tests — which detect fragments of viral proteins — and CRISPR tests — which latch onto RNA sequences from the virus. There is limited information available on how accurate these tests are and when they will be widely available. But as we have learned from the past few months, the situation is rapidly evolving. Employers should continue to monitor updates in this arena, in the event that these offer more viable testing options.

Regardless of whatever combination of testing — or no testing — an employer chooses, it is important that they provide as safe an environment as they can for employees. Follow enhanced infection control practices as previously mentioned: maintain the six feet physical distancing, monitor employee symptoms, conduct regular temperature checks, etc. Planning ahead and being prepared to re-close if the number of symptomatic employees increases will be crucial. And continue following the CDC guidelines, as well as those from local and state health officials.

Three weeks after Georgia became one of the first states to reopen its economy, business owners in the state are divided on how to proceed.

In late April, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp allowed gyms, hair salons, and some other businesses to open, and a week later, he lifted restrictions on most other businesses. The decisions came despite warnings from public health officials that lifting restrictions too soon could cause the number of coronavirus cases to increase drastically.

But for hair salon owner Melissa Singleton, the reversal was welcome news.

""I don't feel like it's too soon,"" Singleton, owner of Melissa's Salon and Spa in Blairsville, told Business Insider Today. ""The economy has got to keep functioning, and we can't just sit back on our heels and wait for the government to supply all of our needs. That's not how America was built and that's not how it's going to survive.""

In the first weekend after Georgia businesses reopened, the state saw 60,000 more out-of-state visitors, mostly from neighboring states that are still shut down.

Singleton works alone in her salon, and only sees one customer at a time. The rural county where she lives and works has had 36 confirmed coronavirus cases as of May 15.

Employees believe the coronavirus pandemic will change their work-life forever.

A recent study of more than 1,000 US workers from the business advisory firm Brunswick found at least 47% of remote workers believe their workplaces will not operate the same way in a post-pandemic world. The report shows that 87% of those not going into work are concerned about another wave of office closures in the future.

""We have found ourselves in a world without work not because the robots have taken our jobs, but because the virus has decimated the demand for so many of these jobs,"" said Daniel Susskind, economist and author of ""A World Without Work: Technology, Automation and How We Should Respond,"" in a recent Goldman Sachs webinar.

The coronavirus has fundamentally changed how Americans work and experts are now reimagining workplaces with a host of new safety measures.

For example, before a vaccine for coronavirus is available, it's likely that employees will see fewer workers in the office, which will help prevent the spread of the virus. Employees can also expect changes to the office floor plan. This includes the addition of an ""officle,"" a door-less space that's a mix between an office and a cubicle, Business Insider previously reported.

With some states in the US already reopening and others scheduled to ease restrictions on stay-at-home orders in the coming weeks, it's important to prepare yourself for how the workplace will change.

Here are four ways you will see the office change once you return to work, based on advice from CEOs and architects.

There will be fewer people in the office

It's likely that most employers won't have everyone return to the office at once. A dense space or large social gatherings can increase the transmission of the disease among coworkers.

Because of this, it's likely that there will be few employees working in the office. Some employees may work from home indefinitely. Managers may also consider staggering work schedules throughout the day, or even alternating days or weeks in the office.

Without a vaccine, you can expect a gradual reentry to the workplace. For example, over the next 12-18 months, there may be a cycle of lockdown and relaxation, with periods of 100% remote work, Business Insider previously reported.

You will have to wear a mask at work

Most states are ordering people to wear a mask in public. It's likely that these measures will include the workplace as well. Some workplaces will use one-way hallways to prevent close contact. Landlords or companies may also screen for fevers and other symptoms at the entrance to an office.

While undergoing these changes, Primo Orpilla, a cofounder and principal of Studio O+A, said workplaces must also prioritize making people feel comfortable.

""How do we tell our people that we're making them safe,"" Orpilla told Business Insider. ""But not make it feel like you're going through immigration at San Francisco International Airport?""

No more checking in at the reception desk

Instead of using a receptionist desk for checking in, it's likely that employees will use a mudroom, or more of a home foyer where you take off your coat and wash your hands.

Also, some companies may forgo self-serving coffee machines, according to the architecture solutions firm Gensler. If the budget allows for this, you may see baristas serving up your favorite coffees in house, according to a sample floor plan from Gensler. Hiring a barista can potentially limit the spread of germs among colleagues, Business Insider reported.

You might be quizzed on new office protocols

When employees go back to work, you will also likely see an increase in communication from managers about the changes coming to a post-pandemic workplace. With these changes on the horizon, you will want to stay in the loop.

For example, the CEO of financial services company Discover, Roger Hochschild, has been sending employees daily emails to update them on the changes the company is making.

Jaclyn Regan of Staten Island, New York is one such bride: Her New Jersey wedding was canceled six days before it was supposed to happen in March.

The cancellation has been emotionally and financially difficult for Regan and her fiancé, Angelo Fallacaro: They lost around $3,000 and are left with now useless, date-specific decor, from champagne flutes to personalized T-shirts.

The couple has rescheduled their big day — and Regan says that compared to how others are suffering right now, they know their problems are small.

On March 14, one week before our wedding, a manager from the catering hall where we were about to be married called and asked how we felt about postponing.

At the time, the threat of the coronavirus was still very new, so while the outbreak was on my mind, it really hadn't been a major concern. We live in Staten Island, where at the time only one case had been confirmed. It was still too early to grasp just how devastating this virus was going to be.

So we sat down with our families, talked over our options, and scheduled a meeting at our venue — South Gate Manor in Freehold, New Jersey — for the next day.

The news wasn't great. The owner of the catering hall had already started to cancel upcoming events. Some of our wedding guests started calling to say they wouldn't be able to make it. Of course I was devastated — everything was set and ready to go, we were so close — but there was a strong possibility that Freehold Township would close down entirely, food deliveries would be delayed, and guests wouldn't be able to get to the hall.

The day was already ruined, six days before it was to happen. We realized it was only logical to postpone.

Reorganizing our wedding has been a bump in the road, a big one, but we're making the best of it. This virus is deadly and scary. So many people are sick and so many people have lost their jobs — I had to throw out a couple of dated items and replace a seating chart. I try to keep it in that perspective. This is obviously not how we planned things, but compared to how others are suffering, it's simply an inconvenience.

In terms of loss, we were actually in a good position. Because we were one of the first weddings to be cancelled, we had our first choice of dates to reschedule. We wanted to recoup as much as possible, so we opted for the next available Friday, which is July 17. South Gate is a big family business — the caterer's sister is his florist, his brother is a photographer — so that made the transition easier. There were just a lot of phone calls and a little bit of juggling to make sure all of the vendors could transfer their services to that date.

The limos, the DJ, and basically everyone else involved were able to make the switch. Our officiant was the only missing piece — we'll have to make a change there — but overall there wasn't major damage.

Some of our flowers were already in transit, so the florist had to accept at least half upon delivery. We had 300 blush roses in our house for days; I was giving them away to friends, neighbors, anyone who would take them.

That portion of the flowers ($1,500) and the officiant fee ($500) were a complete loss. I put off estimating our overall losses for a month, basically thinking ""it is what it is,"" but after adding it all up, it's not nearly as bad as I had imagined. We're losing about $3,000, which is nothing compared to the total cost of the wedding which is around $65,000.

But there's so much that I can't put a price on.

Our date was meaningful to me. It's engraved on my champagne flutes which are now useless. My honeymoon couldn't be salvaged. We were originally going to St. Lucia, but that was booked up in July so we've switched to Barbados. It's fine; it doesn't matter where we go — but summer flights and vacations are almost double the price of what I was paying to go away in March. That's an added expense we weren't counting on.

Date-specific water bottles that will have to be redone. Courtesy photo

I made dozens of overnight bags for the guests who were staying in the hotel; they were filled with personalized water bottles and other dated items which have to be scrapped. Our favors will have to be rewrapped and tagged with our new date, the personalized T-shirts my mom made will now never be worn. Our bridal party gifts were dated and have to be redone. I have everything stored in a spare room, and day by day I realize more and more things that will have to be changed.

I'm worried.

Because we canceled less than a week before the wedding, all of our vendors were already paid in full. I'm confident the payments will be honored and our wedding will eventually go off without a hitch — but we poured all of our money into this big day that still hasn't happened, and now there will be more expenses to come.

Our new date is only a few months away so we're in the process of reprinting and resending invitations, but I'm nervous about making that move. Will this be over by then? Will we get close to that date and realize we have to postpone once again? Right now I feel as if my life is on hold.

Overall I know we're lucky. I'm a teacher and my fiancé is a cop, so we both are still working and we both have our health. A $3,000 loss is tough to bear, especially when so many people are out of work, but it could have been so much worse. My friends and family have been so supportive, and I keep telling myself the worst possible scenario has already happened. It can only get better from here.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

One of the oil industry's most-maligned products, high sulfur fuel oil, is a rare success story during the commodity's record-breaking slump during the coronavirus pandemic, Bloomberg reported Thursday.

HSFO is generally only used in industrial uses like in power plants and to power ships.

HSFO, as it is known, has steadily seen its price increase since the beginning of the crisis as oil refineries shutter production of oil, lessening its supply.

HSFO prices had tanked since last summer when a new set of rules from the International Maritime Organization, which effectively banned ships from using HSFO, was announced.

On Thursday, the gap between the price of HSFO and crude oil was around $35 per barrel. In November 2019, the gap was as big as $85 per barrel.

At a time when oil demand has been ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic, one much-maligned corner of the industry is thriving, Bloomberg reported Thursday.

Prices for high-sulfur fuel oil (HSFO) have jumped to their highest level in nine months relative to the price of crude oil, the news agency reported, as supply of the fuel - which is generally only used in industrial uses like in power plants and on container ships - drops.

The supply level has dropped, Bloomberg reported, because refineries are producing less crude overall, which is in turn lessening the amount of HSFO.

HSFO is a form of oil that is, as its name suggests, high in sulfur, making it less desirable for use in things like automotive and aviation fuels. It is also particularly bad for the environment, and can cause respiratory problems in people. Bloomberg described it as ""oil's worst product.""

Coronavirus has brought a halt in air travel, pushed every major economy into lockdown and greatly battered the demand for gasoline and jet fuel.

""Fuel oil supply has gone down because of the run cuts caused by the pandemic,"" Steve Sawyer, director of refining at Facts Global Energy, told Bloomberg.

Prices for HSFO had plunged last year in anticipation of a new set of rules from the International Maritime Organization, which effectively banned using the fuel to power ships, removing one of its only real uses.

The rules, known as IMO 2020, kicked in on January 1 this year, and mean fuel used on ships is allowed to have a maximum content of 0.5% of sulfur mass-by-mass down from 3.5% previously. HSFO generally has a sulfur content of over 1%.

Those rules sent margins on HSFO down to as low as -$30 per barrel in November 2019. At the same time, US crude oil was worth around $55 per barrel.

But the gap between both is now shrinking, falling from around $85 in November, to $35 now.

As of Thursday, Bloomberg reported, HSFO margins are at around -$7.80 per barrel, compared to a price of around $28 per barrel for crude. The last time HSFO was at such a price level was in July 2019, Bloomberg added.

The price of US oil, West Texas Intermediate, turned negative for the first time in history almost a month ago and Brent, the international benchmark, touched a two year low in part due to low demand for fuel as the pandemic has tanked economic activity, and due to lack of storage options, particularly at a key hub, in Cushing Oklahoma

Prices have recovered since, but fears are mounting that the WTI June contract could also turn negative next week, especially after a US regulator warned traders on Thursday to brace for negative prices again.

The oil volatility has come despite efforts by the OPEC and its allies to reduce production. After a bitter price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia the Consortium reached an arrangement last month to cut production by 9.7 million barrels per day in May and June.

By the time June 1 comes around, more than 100,000 Americans will likely have died from COVID-19, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A dozen different models are all forecasting an increasing rate of death in the coming weeks, even as some states have already begun reopening their economies.

In a May 4 town hall, US President Donald Trump told Fox News viewers that, total, ""we're going to lose anywhere from 75, 80 to 100,000 people."" At that point, there were 68,000 confirmed deaths from COVID-19; as of May 14, there were more than 80,000.

On Friday, CDC Director Robert Redfield stated that the number will likely exceed the president's latest worst-case scenario (itself a revision up from the ""maybe 65,000"" Trump predicted in April) by the end of this month.

And the data suggests that, even as some states have begun easing lock downs, the worst is yet to come, with all the models indicating ""an increase in deaths in the coming weeks.""

As Business Insider reported earlier this month, four states that have already begun opening up are conducting far too little testing to safely do so, according to researchers at Harvard University. Those researchers said the US needed to increase testing 400%, at a minimum, to have any hope of opening up safely — and not exacerbating the spread of the coronavirus.

A 12-year-old from Louisiana has survived a cardiac arrest linked to the coronavirus and a rare inflammatory disorder that has been seen in clusters of children around the world since the pandemic began.

Juliet Daly has made a full recovery after doctors performed two minutes of CPR to revive her.

The medical team later told her father, Sean Daly, that Juliet was suffering from the same multisystem inflammatory syndrome that over 100 children have recently been diagnosed with, including dozens across 15 states in the US.

Dr. Jake Kleinmahon, a pediatric cardiologist at Ochsner Hospital for Children in New Orleans, where Juliet was treated, told CNN that her case of the syndrome was a result of her immune system overreacting to the coronavirus, and causing inflammation throughout the body.

She ""was about as close to death as you can get,"" Kleinmahon said.

Juliet was on a ventilator for four days, and left the hospital on May 15, according to TIME.

Juliet's did not initially have the breathing problems most adults have with COVID-19. Instead she had stomach pain and vomiting, and her lips turned blue.

""I really didn't understand how serious it was but I was scared,"" Juliet, the first child to talk to the press about the experience of the new multisystem inflammatory syndrome, told CNN.

There are plenty of unknowns about the new syndrome, which bears similarities to Kawasaki disease, a little-understood inflammatory disease that predominantely strikes children, and seems to be triggered by a virus or bacterial infection.

The new syndrome has similar symptoms to Kawasaki, like fever and rash. Doctors have also recorded swelling of hands and feet, swollen lymph glands in the neck, and irritation and inflammation of the mouth, lips, and throat.

Some doctors are theorizing that having coronavirus can trigger the immune system's overreaction, and one recent study done by doctors in Bergamo, Italy, found a ""strong association"" between the two conditions.

The disease can be treated with high doses of aspirin or an IV drip of gamma globulin. Without treatment, 15 to 25% of people with disease will develop thinning or bulging of the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart, which can be fatal, according to the US National Library of Medicine.

At least three children in New York have died from the syndrome, and states like Kentucky and Michigan are also reporting cases. The CDC has published a health advisory warning doctors to look out for the symptoms.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

Nearly 100 surrogate-born babies are stranded in Ukraine because their parents are unable to collect them due to border closures imposed because of the coronavirus.

As one of the few countries that grants foreigners this service, Ukraine boasts a robust surrogacy industry. It's an option that appeals to Ukrainian women because of the nation's economic woes, the Associated Press reported. A surrogate mother can earn about $17,000, Sky News said.

Around 50 clinics conduct surrogate births nationwide. However, this usually thriving trade has hit a snag during the pandemic, prompting concerns that an extended lockdown will put pressure on clinics and be difficult for parents, who hail from 12 countries, including the United States, Britain, China, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and Mexico, AP said.

This has prompted Ukraine's human rights ombudswoman, Lyudmyla Denisova, to seek help from authorities.

""About 100 children are already waiting for their parents in different centers of reproductive medicine. And if quarantine is extended, then it will not be about hundreds, but about thousands,"" ombudswoman Lyudmila Denisova said, according to AP.

As of Friday, Ukraine has 17,330 confirmed coronavirus cases and 476 deaths, based on data from Johns Hopkins University.

The country shut down its borders to foreigners in March and these restrictions are expected to remain in place till May 22.

The issue garnered attention when BioTexCom, Ukraine's largest surrogacy clinic, shared footage of rows of bassinets in Kiev's Venice Hotel, where clients usually stay, AP reported. In all, BioTexCom is caring for 51 newborns, Denisova said, adding that an additional 15 babies are with parents who were able to enter Ukraine before the shutdown.

""The children are all provided with food, a sufficient number of employees look after them, but there is no substitute for parental care,"" Denis Herman, the company's lawyer, said to Sky News. ""We try to send photos of children to the parents, we try to make conference calls, but this cannot replace communication in direct contact.""

Parents will only be allowed into Ukraine if the relevant embassy receives a request to that effect, government officials told Sky News.

""The issue remains unresolved, but we are developing a mechanism to get out of the situation,"" Denisova said to AP on Thursday. This would involve foreigners issuing statements to Denisova's office, which would then reach out to the Foreign Ministry.

Rafa Aires was among the few who were able to get into Ukraine to collect his daughter, Marta, before the lockdown was enforced. Now, however, he can't get home, Sky News reported.

His wife is back home in Spain because work prevented her from traveling.

""Every day I make video calls with my wife for one hour or an hour and a half for her to see the baby,"" Aires said. ""It is very difficult.""

BioTexCom's ""wonderful"" nurses and medical staff have been of tremendous help, he added.

However, according to Denisova, BioTexCom's images spotlight a ""massive and systemic"" surrogacy industry with babies being advertised as a ""high-quality product,"" Sky News said. She wants Ukrainian law to be modified to reserve surrogacy for citizens.

In response, BioTexCom's founder Albert Tochilovsky said, ""We were prepared for this negative reaction.""

To understand why, we broke down census, labor, and healthcare data between the two New York City boroughs.

We found that COVID-19 is not the great equalizer.

While Manhattan, on average, has higher incomes and better access to healthcare, the Bronx is up against generations of food deserts, income inequality, crumbling public housing, and poor clinical care. Plus, more frontline workers and subway riders are coming from the Bronx right now.

With 50% more Latino and black residents in the Bronx than Manhattan, you begin to see why being a person of color living in the Bronx makes COVID-19 two times deadlier.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Following is a transcript of the video.



Narrator: Why is COVID-19 hitting some communities harder than others? And who exactly has been hit hardest? We're seeing this happen across the country. But to better understand the divide, we zeroed in on two New York City boroughs: The Bronx and Manhattan.

Even though Manhattan has more people, The Bronx has more cases and more deaths. We wanted to understand the reasons for this gap, so we compared the boroughs based on three criteria: why more people are getting infected, being hospitalized, and dying from COVID-19. And it's revealed this pandemic is attacking two very different Americas. Let's look at why there's a difference in infection numbers between the two boroughs. We'll start with income.

The Bronx is the poorest borough in the city, with a median income of $38,000, compared to Manhattan's $82,000. Almost 60% of people in the Bronx are paying more than they can afford for housing, which has led to more multigenerational housing in the Bronx and more residents in public housing than any other borough. For every apartment in the Bronx, there are 2.8 people living in it. Compare that to the two people living in every apartment in Manhattan. More people at home likely means more people get sick.

Overall, there's 350,000 more housing units in Manhattan than the Bronx, and better-quality housing. See this map? Most residents in the Bronx are dealing with maintenance problems, like leaks, rats, cracks, plumbing, and broken toilets. These issues alone make it more challenging to live at home, not to mention having to work from home because of COVID-19. That is, if you can work from home.

According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, of those Americans making less than $33,000 a year, which are these neighborhoods in the Bronx, 9% of people could work from home. Whereas of those people making more than $79,000 a year, all of these neighborhoods in Manhattan, 60% could work from home. On the other hand, in the Bronx, residents who can't work from home are most likely out of a job and tight on money, or they're essential workers.

Think grocery-store clerks, transit employees, trash collectors, healthcare workers, many of those people you see daily out on the front lines. 17% of frontline workers in New York City are coming from the Bronx, while just 12% are from Manhattan. And for the majority of these essential workers, getting to their job means taking the subway. Subway ridership has dropped across the city, but not by the same amount. In Manhattan, 75% fewer people are riding, but in the Bronx, ridership has dropped only 55%. So trains to and from the Bronx can be packed, especially with reduced subway services. Plus, people from the Bronx face longer commutes than people in Manhattan. On average, 12.7 minutes longer of standing body to body with that person who's maybe coughing.

OK, let's move on to the second criterion. Let's say someone in each borough does get the virus. What will influence whether they become hospitalized? The Bronx has had over 10,000 hospitalizations. Manhattan? About 6,000. Every year, New York counties are ranked based on their health. Last year, Manhattan was sixth best in the state. The Bronx? Dead last, out of 62 counties. This is based on things like access to clinical care, the environment, and preexisting conditions.

The Bronx has higher rates of preexisting conditions like asthma, heart disease, and obesity, conditions that increase the risk of a severe COVID-19 case. To explain why this is, we're gonna have to go deep. We'll start with obesity rates between the two boroughs. Studies have shown that poor diets and lack of exercise are linked to obesity. And in the Bronx, families facing money problems or limited time are forced to turn to cheaper, prepackaged foods. 87% of kids in the Bronx rely on free or reduced school lunches, which are packed with salt and fat. Plus, the Bronx has almost double the amount of food stamps per individual compared to Manhattan.

But the greatest contributor to diet, though, is access. And the Bronx has historically had some of the worst food deserts in the country, where it's hard to find affordable and healthy food close to home. All of these factors have created a lack of healthy resources for generations in the Bronx. They lead to unhealthy eating habits and high rates of obesity and diabetes, both preexisting conditions that increase your risk of death from COVID-19. On the other hand, in Manhattan, life expectancy and access to healthy food is much higher. People not only have more access to grocery stores, they also have more gyms to choose from. Simply put, these things and disposable income make it a lot easier to be healthier here.

Another preexisting condition that skyrockets risk of COVID-19 hospitalization: asthma. In big cities, studies have shown pollution is a major cause of asthma. Pollution is bad across New York City, but the Bronx has the highest rates of asthma-related emergency-room visits. There's even a place nicknamed Asthma Alley in the South Bronx. It's surrounded by four highways and sanitation and sewage facilities. There's also a bunch of trucks coming and going from all of these distribution centers, these food wholesalers, and the FreshDirect distribution center here and the Wall Street Journal and New York Post printing press here. At last count, asthma hospitalizations were 27 times higher in this area than the rest of the city. Bad asthma equals a higher risk of being hospitalized with COVID-19 and needing a ventilator to help you breathe. But it gets worse when you take into account how accessible medical professionals are in these areas.

In Manhattan, there's one physician for every 750 people. In the Bronx, there's one physician for every 1,770 people. There are also fewer hospital beds in the Bronx. Manhattan has almost double the amount of hospitals for only a 15% larger population. That brings us to our third and final criterion. Why are more people dying due to COVID-19 in the Bronx? In Manhattan, four emergency hospitals were constructed to combat coronavirus. While the Bronx was promised one, the borough hasn't gotten it yet. Quality care also isn't as accessible in the Bronx. On average, Manhattan hospitals received three out of five stars. Bronx hospitals received 1.2 out of five stars. Jacobi Hospital in the Bronx is one of the five worst-rated hospitals in the nation.

Add in the effect of preexisting conditions we talked about earlier, and the Bronx has had 2,800 deaths of people with underlying conditions. Manhattan? Almost 1,300. Altogether, as of May 10, Manhattan's death toll was 1,946, while the Bronx hit 3,177 deaths. And when you break down New York City's death toll, people of color are two times more likely to die of coronavirus. In the Bronx, the population is 85% black or Hispanic. Whereas in Manhattan, 64% of the population is white. This is why you're seeing headlines that a disproportionate number of people of color are dying of COVID-19. But these deaths go beyond coronavirus.

For the Bronx, cycles of income inequality, food deserts, poor healthcare, fewer hospitals, and crumbling housing have harmed communities of color for generations. And we see this pattern repeat itself again and again with black and brown communities across the country. Baltimore, Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis, Los Angeles. This disease is not the great equalizer. Yes, anyone can get COVID-19. But not everyone is as vulnerable to dying from it. That has everything to do with the problems in place long before this ever started.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

The US Food and Drug Administration just alerted consumers to the potential accuracy problems and is working with the company to do more studies.

Abbott has conceded that false negatives can occur, but says the test works well if used with fresh samples on swabs, rather than those dissolved in liquid.

The White House is testing its staff for coronavirus using a device made by Abbott Laboratories that has been criticized for giving false negatives.

The New York Times reported that the White House is using the ID Now rapid testing system, which can give results in less than 13 minutes.

However, a study released Tuesday by researchers at New York University found that the system missed a third of the positive samples when using nasal swabs in vials, and more than 48% when using dry nasal swabs. The report hasn't yet been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

Another study in late April found that it was showing a false negative in around 15% of cases — a result affirmed by the director of the National Institutes of Health. Around the same time, Abbott said that the tests work properly when swabs are put directly into the device as opposed to dissolved in liquid.

On Thursday, the US Food and Drug Administration said it's received no less than 15 reports of Abbott's device returning false negatives and is aware of the recent research. Abbott has agreed to run more studies and sent out a letter notifying customers that negative results needed to be confirmed with another test, the FDA said.

Abbott did not return a request for comment, but said on Twitter that the NYU results were not consistent with other studies. It pointed to a report out of Washington state that showed ID NOW picked up on 21 out of 23 coronavirus-positive samples.

""We have many questions for the NYU study authors,"" the company said.

Rolled out across much of the US

These warnings come after the tests have been rolled out across much of the US, and have been distributed by the federal government. The device, which is the size of a toaster, was given emergency authorization by the FDA in March.

The White House has also tested some aides using other methods, which take longer to process, the Times reported.

US President Donald Trump then called the tests ""a whole new ballgame"" and ""highly accurate.""

Some staff are still working in the White House during the outbreak, and at least a dozen people who may work near Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have tested positive for the virus in the past week.

Kevin Hassett, a senior economic adviser to Trump, said on Sunday that working from home would be safer for White House staff.

But he argued that officials are ""willing to take that chance because we love our country."" He also called the West Wing ""relatively cramped.""

The Washington Post reported on Sunday that White House staff are not being given clear instructions whether to work from home or not.

Last week, analysts at SVB Leerink interviewed three experts in infectious disease immunology, epidemiology, and public health about ""back to normal"" strategies in the US.

The conversation reveals how many questions remain unanswered about the novel coronavirus and how it can be stopped — from basic, disease-specific concerns like symptoms and transmission, to testing complications and herd immunity, according to a summary the analysts, led by Geoffrey Porges, sent investors.

In the US, COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has killed nearly 80,000 people and is leading to strange complications in children that scientists still don't understand. Meanwhile, even in the fourth month of US outbreaks, confusion persists about how new testing methodologies and treatments will be deployed.

The experts, who were not identified by SVB Leerink, were particularly worried about rural and urban disparities in testing the effects as stay-at-home orders are lifted, according to the summary.

One expert is ""deeply worried"" that the US will return back to where it started, as the positive test rate is still high in several areas that plan to loosen restrictions, according to the summary.

The experts ""are concerned that once the social distance measures are relaxed there will be a surging number of infected cases,"" the Leerink analysts wrote.

New York is looking to partially reopen starting May 15, based on a set of criteria used to evaluate outbreaks at the local level. Similarly, California released reopening guidelines last week for counties and businesses.

Meanwhile, testing and tracing capabilities as a whole ""still seem shorthanded,"" particularly in rural areas, according to the experts. As reported by The Atlantic last week, the US needs to double or triple its daily testing, but the federal government has no plans to support that increase.

The experts also believe further research is required to address a number of questions about COVID-19's manifestation, duration of immunity, and the role of children in its transmission.

Here are 5 key takeaways from the report.

The role of children in transmission is still unknown

It's still not clear whether children play a major role in coronavirus transmission, according to the experts. For other respiratory diseases like the flu, children are known to be ""major drivers for community transmission,"" the report said.

But in those cases, children tend to develop severe symptoms compared to their adult counterparts, which isn't true for COVID-19. Meanwhile, such a small group of symptomatic coronavirus cases in children makes them difficult to study, the experts told SVB Leerink.

Contact tracing is a method by which public health officials work with a sick patient to find everyone they've come into contact with. One expert told Leerink that the logic is straightforward, but the logistics are not.

For 100 coronavirus cases per day, for example, and 10-15 contacts for each case, up to 300 tracing workers with 40-hour work weeks are needed, according to the summary. States like New York, Maryland, and Massachusetts are all planning to hire or hiring contact tracers, they said.

Still a long way to national testing

Testing underpins all other health and economic measures meant to combat the virus, the experts told SVB Leerink. Today, it's not coordinated at a national level, leading to ""significant variability"" among different geographic regions, according to the report.

Until testing infrastructure is ""formalized,"" country-wide reopening will be problematic, they said.

Current coronavirus tests aren't always accurate

The US Food and Drug Administration has taken steps to get faulty antibody tests off the market, but their accuracy is still wide-ranging. One expert pointed out that tests relying on pinpricks tend to perform worse than those relying on blood draws analyzed in laboratories.

Mitigation efforts alone will not end the pandemic

While social distancing helps, and more people could potentially gain immunity, the only thing that will truly stop the virus in its tracks is a vaccine, according to the experts.

""We will ultimately need vaccination (or a large number of infection cases) in combination with social distancing to contain spread and allow some return to our usual activities,"" the summary said.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

Microsoft is working with the Seattle-based biotech Adaptive Biotechnologies to better understand the different ways that individuals' immune systems respond to the virus.

The duo are now recruiting 1,000 people for a study that will analyze T cells, a critical component in how human bodies fight invading threats.

The early research could help build T-cell tests, which could supplement antibody testing. It could also better instruct vaccines and therapeutics that are now in development.

""What we're developing is a third pillar of diagnostics, which is looking specifically at the T cells,"" said Lance Baldo, chief medical officer of Adaptive Biotechnologies.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The novel coronavirus has confounded doctors by causing a range of symptoms in patients.

COVID-19 is first and foremost a lung disease, but its effects can include blood clots, heart problems, and even 'COVID toes' that turn purple and swollen. Some patients have mild symptoms, and others get severely ill.

Plus, some of the most critically ill patients appear to suffer more from their own immune response than from the virus itself. The immune system goes into hyperdrive, overreacting to the virus and causing serious damage to the person's own body.

Researchers are now trying to unravel the mysteries about the immune system's response to the coronavirus. A better understanding of how humans react to the virus could instruct future diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.

The technology giant Microsoft has jumped into this work, focusing on a part of the immune response not frequently talked about — at least not yet — with COVID-19: T cells.

Microsoft is working with Adaptive Biotechnologies, a Seattle biotech specializing in decoding immune responses. Adaptive has a market value of about $4.7 billion.

The duo are hoping that better understanding the T-cell response in humans could be help understand and fight the virus. Microsoft will help crunch the massive amount of collected data using its machine learning capabilities and Azure cloud platform.

The two started working together in 2018 to develop a T-cell blood test that could detect multiple diseases, such as Lyme disease. While that work is ongoing, the companies expanded the agreement in March to include COVID-19.

Antibodies have been a research focus for COVID-19 testing, therapeutics, and vaccines

Antibodies have been the star of the show, hogging much of the early attention. These virus-fighting proteins have been known by scientists for more than a century. Going back to the 1918 influenza pandemic, they are the key ingredient in the treatment called convalescent plasma, which helps the sick recover.

Over the last three decades, scientists have developed methods to screen antibodies for potency, then clone and produce the best candidates at massive scale. These antibody treatments are now being developed for COVID-19, with human testing expected to start this summer.

Antibodies have also become a focus of the diagnostic world. Called serological tests, a blood sample can reveal if someone has coronavirus-fighting antibodies. If they do, it likely suggests a level of protection against re-infection. The best serological tests now have extremely high accuracy rates.

Antibodies will also likely play a role in the race for a coronavirus vaccine. Researchers are now trying to figure out the level of antibodies needed in the body to protect against infection. That could be used as an indirect measure to see if experimental vaccines are producing enough antibodies to protect people.

T cells could also play a key role in COVID-19

But antibodies are just one part of the immune response. Another key element in fighting viral infections is T cells.

T cells are the body's first response to a foreign invader in the body. Some T cells will kill infected cells and fight the virus, and others help pump out antibodies and coordinate the body's attack.

While much of COVID-19 research is digging into the antibody response, the T-cell response remains more of a mystery.

To better understand the role of T cells, Microsoft and Adaptive have launched a 1,000-person study across the US. The research is early, and plans to explore how T-cell responses vary from person to person.

They are recruiting people who have likely been exposed to the virus, are infected, and have recently recovered. Volunteers will have their blood drawn and nose or throat swabbed by a phlebotomist who will visit their home.

Lance Baldo, the chief medical officer of Adaptive, said he hopes the findings could help build better diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines for COVID-19.

'Developing a third pillar of diagnostics'

""What we're developing is a third pillar of diagnostics, which is looking specifically at the T cells,"" Baldo said in an interview.

A T-cell test could complement serological testing, particularly if it can help identify some of the gaps in antibody-based tests. It's unclear if every recovered COVID-19 patient generates long-lasting, protective antibodies. If some do not develop a meaningful antibody response, a T-cell test could help figure out who is truly protected, Baldo said.

T cells have mainly been the focus of cancer treatments, perhaps best known for the CAR-T therapies that first came to market in 2017. These ground-breaking treatments fight certain types of cancer using patients' own T cells, genetically engineering them to be more potent.

It's too early to know if there could be a similar treatment for COVID-19. CAR-T therapies are complicated and expensive, with serious potential side effects.

But the T-cell trial could help answer many questions about the coronavirus. Baldo said his researchers are planning to use the data to map the natural decay of T cells. This could help quantify when someone was first infected with COVID-19.

Another potential use would be flagging people that are likely to suffer from an overactive immune response to infection. The research could help explain why some infected people have mild symptoms while others wind up on ventilators. ICU patients have significantly lower levels of T-cells than other patients, some early findings suggest.

A T-cell test could add an extra stamp on the immunity passport

Policymakers across the world are mulling the idea of 'immunity passports.' The idea being that people who have recovered from the virus are likely immune to re-infection, and could safely re-enter the workforce and society.

There are ethical and scientific concerns around the idea. We do not know how long-lasting any type of immunity is. And it could incentivize people to intentionally try to get infected, if the alternative is sheltering inside while others are free to roam.

""Immunity is going to be hard, because for immunity you really need re-exposure if you're going to say that you are immune,"" Baldo said. ""We can impute that someone is immune, but to actually say someone is immune is going to be hard for a while.""

Baldo has reservations about the immunity passport concept, but added if countries do take that approach it likely won't be just one test. Instead, it may require several serology tests along with a T-cell test, for instance, like collecting multiple stamps on a passport.

Adaptive's Baldo said they are hoping to draw some initial insights from this T-cell study in June. The companies have pledged to make the data freely available to researchers. So far, about 100 people have joined and the study is recruiting in roughly two dozen metro areas across the US.

COVID-19 patients with heart problems suffer worse outcomes, said Dr. Christopher Moore, an emergency physician at Yale New Haven Hospital.

Caption's software makes it easier for nurses or frontline to do these heart scans, which can help identify high-risk COVID-19 patients.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Many people view the coronavirus as an accelerant for business trends that were already happening.

While healthcare has been notoriously slow in adapting to the digital world, the virus has sped up some of the efforts, such as an explosion in telehealth.

The virus also accelerated plans for the artificial-intelligence startup Caption Health. Brisbane, California-based Caption announced this week that its AI software to scan hearts was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, just 25 days after the company submitted it to US regulators. An earlier version won clearance in February.

The approval allows hospitals to start using the software now in the fight against COVID-19. CEO Andy Page said eight hospitals —including Northwestern, University of Chicago, and ChristianaCare — are using the software, and he hopes to double that figure by the end of June.

Page joined Caption in 2018, aiming to transition the company from research and development to commercial stage. He previously was president at 23andMe, a personal genetics company, and a C-suite exec at Livongo, a digital health company.

Page said he was anticipating a commercial launch of the software in August, but now plans to do so sooner. The company has about 65 employees and is growing rapidly, he said.

Caption was founded in 2013, and has raised $20 million to date from investors include Kholsa Ventures. Page said to ""stay tuned' on the funding front, declining to provide more specifics or a current valuation.

Ultrasounds can help identify heart problems in COVID-19 patients

Physicians have noticed that people with heart problems who get infected with the coronavirus seem to fare much worse. And researchers are still figuring out the relationship between COVID-19 and the heart — the disease may cause or exacerbate heart issues in some people.

""It's very clear that patients with pre-existing cardiac problems do more poorly when they have COVID,"" said Dr. Christopher Moore, an emergency physician at Yale New Haven Hospital. More research is needed to figure out if the disease can cause heart problems on its own, he added.

Moore has no financial ties to Caption Health, but wrote a letter to the FDA supporting approval of the software.

Proactively identifying high-risk patients could help doctors keep closer tabs on them for severe complications. Heart ultrasounds can detect these patients, but also require technical training to administer.

""Ultrasound is a very powerful technology, but it's difficult,"" Moore said in an interview.

Scanning the heart requires taking several images with an ultrasound, sent by a probe that shoots a beam of sound through the chest. It can be challenging to get good images of the beating heart, especially if the devices aren't used by an experienced operator.

Caption's software allows people without these skills to perform cardiac ultrasounds anyway. STAT reporter Matthew Herper, for instance, chronicled last October his own experience in scanning a heart with the system.

'Like depositing a check in the bank'

The software guides users through each step, using what the company calls prescriptive guidances. When the scanner gets to the right angle at the right time, the software takes over.

""We auto-capture, kind of like depositing a check in the bank,"" Page said.

Caption Health CEO Andy Page Caption Health

For COVID-19, the software could allow frontline nurses and doctors to perform those scans, making them available to more patients.

At the company's holiday party, Page said they had the software available for people to try.

""We found people that have done video games before were quite proficient, because they are used to seeing descriptions on the screen,"" Page said. ""We were able to get people up to speed in literally less than an hour.""

Having founded and run a fellowship in ultrasounds at Yale for more than a decade, Moore said he's more enthusiastic about the scans than most doctors.

""The next frontier, which is where Caption Health is, is AI,"" said Moore. ""Using AI both to help people obtain the images and interpret the images.""",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

A big chunk of that time is spent testing the vaccine to make sure it's safe for people to take and that it works to prevent the disease.

Researchers are looking at every possible way to shorten this process for a coronavirus vaccine.

Three strategies have emerged to test a vaccine more quickly amid a crisis, vaccine experts say. They are human challenge trials, stepped wedge designs, and ring vaccination.

Each approach comes with its own benefits and risks, according to vaccine experts we interviewed.

Developing a vaccine is a critical element in squashing the coronavirus pandemic.

But there's no consensus on the best way to actually test a vaccine for safety and efficacy during a crisis. What there are, however, are three leading ideas on how to test vaccines. Each approach comes with unique pros and cons.

There are now more than 100 potential coronavirus vaccines in the works, at least 20 of which are expected to enter human testing within this year. But turning early research into a real vaccine requires time and resources.

The potential ways to vet a possible coronavirus vaccine more quickly are human challenge trials, stepped wedge designs, and ring vaccination, according to top vaccine experts interviewed by Business Insider. All the approaches can speed up testing a vaccine, a process that normally takes multiple years with several distinct clinical trials.

But any of the strategies will test ordinary research protocols that call for substantial testing before a vaccine is used broadly. The safety bar is particularly high for vaccines since they are given to massive populations of healthy people.

Warren/Associated Press

Additionally, some of the approaches carry ethical concerns. Challenge trials, for instance, promise a speedy answer as to whether a vaccine works, because people who get the immunization are then exposed to the virus. Those volunteers could be risking their lives if the vaccine fails and they become ill.

Others, like the ring vaccination strategy, wouldn't raise the same ethical worries but require more time. Ring vaccination has helped control outbreaks of smallpox and Ebola in the past. Dr. Francis Collins

Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said that running a gold-standard clinical trial, in which some people get the vaccine and others gets the placebo, in an area with a coronavirus outbreak, is likely to be the best approach.

""Why don't we just do this the way that would be most straightforward"" Collins said, ""which is to enroll tens of thousands of participants in areas where the virus is still circulating with an appropriate placebo control and see whether it works or not.""

No matter which approach is taken, there is also skepticism that any vaccine could be widely available within 18 months. That timeline has been echoed by prominent health officials, nonprofit leaders, and policymakers.

That isn't stopping companies from racing to develop a vaccine in record time, with three leading vaccine programs aiming to be ready this fall for emergency use.

Here are the three main approaches that researchers are considering to test a coronavirus vaccine.

Human challenge trials offer speed but raise ethical concerns about exposing people to the virus

In challenge trials, participants would be vaccinated and then intentionally exposed to the virus. The design offers an attractive option for those wanting a quick answer.

""There are some people calling for that,"" Dr. Greg Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group, said. ""You could decide in weeks whether this vaccine candidate works or doesn't."" Dr. Greg Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group Mayo Clinic

One of the leading advocates for challenge studies is Dr. Stanley Plotkin. Plotkin has been in vaccine research for more than half a century, helping discover the rubella virus vaccine in the 1960s.

""We don't know whether there is such a thing as immunity to the virus,"" Plotkin told Business Insider. ""Until we know that, vaccines are going to be hypothetical. That's really the crucial question at the moment, and the sooner we know the answer to that, the better off we're going to be.""

Challenge studies could help answer that question quickly. Along with New York University bioethicist Arthur Caplan, Plotkin argued that challenge studies are the way to go. While unusual, the design has been used before in humans for vaccines for influenza and malaria.

Arthur L Caplan NYU School of Medicine ""Deliberately causing disease in humans is normally abhorrent, but asking volunteers to take risks without pressure or coercion is not exploitation but benefiting from altruism,"" Plotkin and Caplan wrote. ""We are aware of multiple offers from people willing to volunteer for the challenge studies. As Shakespeare put it, 'Desperate diseases by desperate measures are relieved.'""

Mayo's Poland cautioned that a challenge trial can be done but may lead to unforeseen problems.

""I think there's a way to do it,"" he said. ""You have to be very, very careful about full informed consent because bad things can happen that you may not be able to predict or are not even thinking about. That's part of the history of vaccinology. It's that things happen that we don't expect.""

Maria Elena Bottazzi, a vaccine researcher at Baylor College, said it took years to devise a challenge model for malaria, and a key consideration was having a treatment available in case the vaccine didn't work.

""You have to have a way of getting rid of the virus or reducing the disease that the virus causes,"" she said.

Despite generating a lot of publicity, no vaccine company has announced plans to run such a study in COVID-19.

Collins told Business Insider he's skeptical of this approach and said he doesn't think it will play a role in developing a vaccine for COVID-19.

Starting a human challenge study would require having good manufacturing practice material that's ready to go, Collins said.

""None of these vaccine platforms are there yet,"" Collins said. ""When they get there, they will be ready also to start a standard efficacy trial enrolling thousands of patients, which is a much more compelling way to show whether the vaccine actually works in the real world.""

NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins speaks during a Senate hearing. Reuters

Collins also says that since challenge studies would use healthy young people as volunteers, they wouldn't necessarily provide a clear answer for efficacy for more vulnerable populations, like the elderly or those with chronic illnesses.

""And of course there are profound ethical questions about whether it is justifiable to put a healthy person at risk when we don't have a cure for this disease that they happen to get sick anyway,"" he continued. ""So I think at the present time, the case for it is pretty weak. The case against it is pretty strong.""

Stepped-wedge design has some prominent backers, including a leading vaccine program

A stepped-wedge design straddles the line between clinical testing and widespread use. The design evaluates a vaccine candidate during an outbreak while also providing significant quantities of the vaccine to the public. It's important to have some data showing that the vaccine is safe before using this strategy, though.

""The point is to provide some potential benefit while building a large and rigorous data set to evaluate its safety and effectiveness,"" Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former head of the FDA and a board member at Pfizer, wrote in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed. Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb Reuters

Gottlieb laid out the example of using this design in a city suffering an outbreak. Large clusters of people would be vaccinated at staggered times. In Gottlieb's hypothetical, it could be 25,000 people being vaccinated every two weeks.

That could lead to 100,000 vaccinations in six weeks and allow researchers to compare the groups to see if the timing difference changed the likelihood of becoming infected. If the vaccine works, the groups that received it earlier should have significantly lower levels of COVID-19.

Pfizer's Mikael Dolsten Thomson Reuters Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer's chief scientific officer, outlined a very similar strategy for its vaccine candidate. He told Business Insider that Pfizer's vaccine could be tested like this under an emergency use program this fall, vaccinating tens of thousands of people while collecting data to see if the vaccine works.

The ring vaccination strategy took down smallpox and Ebola, but requires precise and strenuous tracing

Ring vaccination studies helped tackle smallpox and Ebola. While it could have a role in COVID-19, the studies require significant public health infrastructure to run correctly.

""It doesn't necessarily mean it's going to work for this,"" Bottazzi warned, saying ring vaccination requires rigorous contract tracing to find all the people who've been in contact with an infected person.

In ring vaccination, a team of researchers or public health workers quickly track down all the close contacts of an infected person. These potentially exposed people would then be vaccinated.

With the right resources, it can be a valuable approach to eradicating diseases. That's what happened in the latter half of the 20th century to eradicate smallpox. The disease had lingered for nearly two centuries after a vaccine was first developed in the 1790s. It remains the only disease to be vanquished by a vaccine.

The smallpox eradication program used two levels of contract tracing. It vaccinated everyone who had been in contact with a confirmed smallpox case. And then researchers also vaccinated the close contacts of all those potentially exposed people.

Ebola vaccines were tested in a similar fashion. In one of those trials, contacts were randomized to either immediately receive a vaccine or be immunized three weeks later. The end result was thousands of people were vaccinated, helping stop the spread of the virus while building the data that supported regulatory approval of a vaccine.

The US is unprepared to perform ring vaccination given the lack of testing and contract tracing currently available.

""We don't have the testing capacity now to know where this disease is,"" Dr. Richard Besser, the former acting head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently told CNN. ""We have not scaled up the thousands and thousands of contact tracers that we need, we don't provide safe places for people to isolate or quarantine if they are identified as either having an infection or being in contact.""",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

The CDC on Thursday issued an advisory about a ""multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children"" that has been recorded in other countries and connected to the coronavirus by Italian doctors.

It urged doctors to report cases to health departments so the virus can be studied, and said it is it not known if the illness can affect adults.

At least three children in New York and one in the UK have died from the illness.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned doctors about a rare inflammatory and sometimes deadly condition that has been found in children and connected to the coronavirus.

The CDC on Thursday issued a health advisory about what it named a ""multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children"" (MIS-C) that is ""associated with"" the COVID-19 disease.

It urged medical workers to report anyone who has the symptoms to health departments so more can be learned about it, noting that there is currently ""limited information.""

It defined the illness as involving someone aged 20 or younger that has been infected by or exposed to the coronavirus, and has had a fever of at least 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) for at least 24 hours.

A general view of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta in 2014. Reuters

The patient also needs to have laboratory-proved inflammation and ""evidence of clinically severe illness requiring hospitalization, with multisystem organ involvement"" without any other plausible diagnosis for these problems.

The illness, which has already killed some children, are similar to Kawasaki disease, a disease that inflames the walls of the arteries and typically affects just one in 10,000 children.

Doctors began studying MIS-C as cases surged higher than the usual rate of Kawasaki disease, and as coronavirus cases increased globally.

The CDC said that some cases may look like Kawasaki disease, but their cases should still be reported if they have the symptoms for this new condition.

Doctors in some of the areas worst-hit by the coronavirus around the world have reported cases of this mysterious inflammatory syndrome in children.

Doctors in the UK first reported in April that they were seeing a serious condition that meant children needed intensive care, warning that ""there is a growing concern that a [COVID-19] related inflammatory syndrome is emerging in children in the UK, or that there may be another, as yet unidentified, infectious pathogen associated with these cases.""

At least one child — a 14-year-old boy — has died from the illness in the UK. Three children in New York have also died from the illness, with the state announcing earlier in May that it is testing children for antibodies.

British medical experts are also researching the illness, the UK government said.

Multiple countries, including France and Spain, have since reported cases.

Doctors in Italy announced Thursday that they found evidence connecting the illness to COVID-19 after finding coronavirus antibodies in the majority of infected children.

Doctors there provisionally gave it the name Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporarily Associated with SARS-CoV-2, or PIMS-TS for short.

The CDC also said Thursday that it is not yet clear if this illness can also affect adults.

María Galán, Sandra Majada, Dionisio Juanas, Ignacio Montes, and Cristina Nieto were all diagnosed with COVID-19 in the past few months.

All of them have recovered since.

They told Business Insider what it was like experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, what they have learned, and what they would tell others going through the same thing.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Out of the 4.3 million people around the world who have been infected with COVID-19, some 1.5 million have recovered.

Despite this recovery rate, many people still don't know what it's like to have the coronavirus, and how to deal with early symptoms.

Five people who recovered from the disease have told Business Insider what the virus feels like, the symptoms you need to be aware of, and what they wish they had known before contracting it.

How to catch initial symptoms

In March, María Galán, Sandra Majada, Dionisio Juanas, Ignacio Montes, and Cristina Nieto — who live across Spain — all began to notice symptoms of the coronavirus in themselves.

Having paid close attention to the news, many of them recognized the symptoms as being associated with the illness.

María woke up one day a little cold, with sneezing, mucus, headache, and a very slight fever.

At first, it seemed like her symptoms were those from a common cold or flu. But as they worsened and wouldn't go away, she realized it was much more serious.

""I was very tired. I had headaches and a fever that wouldn't subside,"" María said. ""After a few days, I assumed I'd gotten over the cold symptoms.""

""I realized I was infected when I was cleaning with bleach and realized that I couldn't smell a thing.""

Sandra Majada. Business Insider España

Experts have advised that people suffering from coronavirus symptoms and those who have tested positive completely isolate themselves in a room in their home.

But it's harder than it sounds.

""Just a week before I started to feel ill, my boyfriend — with whom I was isolating — came down with a high fever of up to 102 degrees Fahrenheit for seven to eight days and a lot of headaches, "" said María.

""It coincided with the start of working from home, schools closing, and the declaration a state of emergency.""

Both had to manage the situation while cohabiting a 55-square-meter apartment in the center of Madrid.

Neither of them was able to purchase masks or gloves and, though they tried their best to keep at a safe distance, infection was almost inevitable.

Not everyone gets the same symptoms

Ignacio waited a few days for his symptoms to get worse before seeking medical help.

At first, he followed the medical advice to stay home and keep an eye on his breathing. After some time, though, he realized he really wasn't well. Doctors asked him to return for closer examination.

He was sent home after that but saw no improvement the next day.

Eventually, he had to see a private doctor, who prescribed him treatment, including the Azithromycin antibiotic and bronchodilators, which help relax the airways and help people breathe.

""The emergency rooms were empty. I was quickly attended to and given a lung scan,"" he said.

""The doctor told me that, thankfully, my lungs were fine at the moment and that what I was experiencing was the acute bronchitis associated with COVID-19.""

Dionisio Juanas says medical treatment was non-existent and he had next to no follow-up care. Business Insider España

Different health systems give different levels of care

Dionisio suffered from the illness alongside his family.

When they started getting symptoms, they contacted their local clinic for advice because people had been asked not to go to hospitals on their own.

""Care has been nonexistent,"" Dionisio said, adding that the only advice he was given was to ""control the fever.""

He said he and his family called the health services twice but received the same response.

Meanwhile, Cristina said her experience with her local health system was positive. She went once to see her local doctor, and once to the hospital emergency room.

There, they performed a chest scan which indicated she was positive for COVID-19.

""They saw I had a mild case of pneumonia so they sent me home with specific medication for the virus and called me regularly from April 6 until recently,"" she says.

""On Sunday, April 12, they told me I had been discharged from La Paz,"" referring to Hospital La Paz, in Madrid, where she visited.

After that, her local doctor was tasked with monitoring her condition and continued to call her to check in.

Cristina Nieto was missing a lot of information while she was suffering with the coronavirus. Business Insider España

What they wish they had known

All five told Business Insider they wish they had a complete list of COVID-19 symptoms when they were starting to get their own.

They said such a list had been slow to surface, making it hard for them to understand what they were going through.

Only in late March did health agencies start discussing the loss of taste and smell, and muscle pain, as a symptom — and by then, many had already experienced it.

Cristina feels that she lacked enough information to manage her situation properly.

Advice for people going through COVID-19

Sandra wants to reassure people who notice that their symptoms not going away after a period of time.

""Although the symptoms last a long time, the best thing to do is to stay as calm as you can and to be very patient,"" she said.

All stress that staying calm is key, as the number of patients who recover from the coronavirus is high.

Borders, who made his fortune by founding Borders and Webvan, is now preparing to launch a new grocery delivery startup, HDS, as online food shopping remains one of the few bright spots in the economy.

But other startups in industries hit harder by the coronavirus might not have it so easy, Borders acknowledged.""Be ready to pivot, and pivot hard,"" Borders advised.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Louis Borders has watched the economy go through some dramatic cycles over the last half-century, boosting businesses to sky-high levels and then dragging them down.

But he says that the dot.com bust, the 2008 recession, and every other recession that he's lived through never reached the scale of the current downturn.

""In my lifetime, we haven't had anything like this,"" the 71-year-old entrepreneur told Business Insider. ""It's a completely new world.""

Over the years, Borders has made a name for himself as an entrepreneur to watch. He founded the bookstore chain Borders, which was valued at $190 million when Borders sold it to Kmart in 1992 (the chain later made its debut on the public market and eventually filed for bankruptcy in 2011).

He then made his way to Silicon Valley, where his grocery delivery startup Webvan attracted funding from SoftBank, Sequoia, and Benchmark.

But Borders has also personally experienced the extent to which a downturn can bring a business crashing down: Webvan made its debut on the public market in 2001, and proceeded to run into a stream of troubles. Borders had already stepped down as CEO in 1999, but he watched his brainchild spiral downwards and eventually file for bankruptcy in 2001.

Now, as he prepares to launch a new grocery delivery startup at a moment when online grocery orders are surging, Borders is hesitant to offer advice to other startups that may be squeezed by the current business disruptions, because luck can play such a big role in making or breaking their fates.

""I don't even know what to say — we happen to be fortunate that it [the coronavirus] was great for our business but if you are a company that's based in retail stores, then you're really in trouble,"" Borders said.

Still, he has a few fail-safe lessons that he's picked up over the years.

""The basics of good startups, to me, is to pay attention to your talent, respect your investors, and be really upfront with where you are and what you're doing,"" Borders said.

And right now, as the coronavirus reshapes the economic landscape, Borders suggests that startups lean into the change.

The region's rivals see it as a growth opportunity.,https://i.insider.com/5ebf1e4e3f73702b225c9274?width=1200&format=jpeg,"San Francisco Bay Area.

Coronavirus is prompting some tech workers to consider leaving the Bay Area.

They're betting that permanent work-from-home policies will become more and more popular — lessening the troubled region's allure.

Some realtors in other smaller cities across the Western US say they've seen an uptick in interest from Bay Area residents looking to decamp.

And regional organisations and preparing to launch programs to attract remote workers to their states.

Coronavirus has some tech workers reconsidering their commitment to the San Francisco Bay Area.

The region's high cost of living, traffic, and housing crisis have long been pain points for professionals in the technology industry headquartered there — but now offices closures and work-from-home policies are prompting a renewed questioning of whether it's still worth it.

With companies like Twitter announcing that it will allow employees to work remotely even after pandemic lockdowns lift for good, some industry-watchers are predicting the city will rapidly lose its luster as workers decamp for more appealing locales.

In conversations with Business Insider, realtors in smaller cities say they're seeing increased interest from potential Bay Area buyers, regional development groups are scrambling to put out the welcome mats for remote workers, and investors are said to be looking to capitalize on the trend.

Balaji Srinivasan, a Silicon Valley investor and entrepreneur, predicted on Twitter that the lockdown and new work-from-home policies are removing some of the few incentives left for people to stay in the Bay Area. ""The office isn't used, the industry is going remote. So SF is just pure repulsion. And people will fly away,"" he wrote.

The prohibitive cost of living in the Bay Area and lack of housing stock has already forced many — particularly younger generations — to consider relocating in recent years, said Skylar Olsen, senior principal economist at real estate listing firm Zillow. If permanent work-from-home policies become more and more prevalent post-lockdown, that may well accelerate the trend.

The multimillion-dollar question is whether that will translate into workers moving out to the suburbs, or going further afield.

Even if they can work remotely, workers are still likely to favour metropolitan areas with access to creature comforts over more far-flung locales: think a condo in downtown Bozeman, Montana rather than a cabin in the depths of Kootenai National Forest. ""Our value we place on amenity-rich, walkable neighborhoods is still really high,"" she said, and that's unlikely to change after the lockdown lifts.

Real estate listing site Realtor.com said they saw a surge in people Bay Area looking for listings elsewhere as lockdowns came into affect. ""The Bay Area's balance of within-metro and outbound home searches tipped substantially toward outbound starting in mid-March,"" spokesperson Cody Horvat said. ""The share of traffic from the Bay Area looking outside of the area jumped up 3.4 percent in April compared to the same period last year, marking the largest jump in outbound traffic share so far in 2020.""

That surge has since subsided, and the areas that saw the most interest from Bay Area users were Los Angeles and Riverside in California, Las Vegas, Houston and Chicago.

It's hard to quantify any potential lockdown-influenced increase in sales this early, with deals typically taking a month or more to close. But Tony Levison, a realtor in picturesque Bend, Oregon, said he's seen an uptick recently in interest from Bay Area buyers.

""It's a direct flight to most of the major cities on the West Coast ... you can get anywhere pretty fast, and you don't have ot deal with the city lifestyle any more. Lots of outdoor activities, smaller town, and for a lot of people in the major cities, it's a lot more affordable, too.""

In Bozeman, Montana, Noel Seeburg, a realtor with Bozeman Real Estate Group, also said he's seen some increased interest — in particular from investors looking to buy up properties to rent to workers who might be relocate.

In Nevada — home to beautiful Lake Tahoe and bustling Reno — the government-backed Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada (EDAWN) is actively developing a new program in response to coronavirus to try and attract new remote workers to the state, Mike Kazmierski, the organization's CEO said, to be rolled out after the lockdowns lift.

""There's no need for that workforce, regardless of the lockdown, to be stuck with high prices, traffic, all those other issues ... associated with California, when they can do the exact same job 30 minutes away from a ski slope.""

That said, there's at least one group predictably confident that the Bay Area won't lose its allure any time soon: San Francisco realtors.

Mariana Pappalardo, a realtor with Sotheby's, said she's seen some uptick in interest in people looking to get out of the city (one client is ""more motivated than ever to get out of here and move to Tahoe"") but predicted that work from home won't become the norm.

""Eventually, people are going to want to see people in the office,"" she said. ""I think this trend of working remotely is going to be popular for a year, tops, and then the shareholders are gonna want to see some faces.""

Plus, she added, San Francisco's incredibly dense network of talent will long continue to be a major draw.

""We have such a strong population ... nine out of ten of my clients have a PhD, where else do you get that? Those people are going to move to Montana and be bored out of their minds.""

Tice also harbors a bearish stock outlook. He was expecting the latest market rally because of what technical indicators were signaling, but doesn't think it has staying power.

Michael Batnick, the director of research at Ritholtz Wealth Management, bolsters Tice's case that the current rally is vulernable with historical evidence showing previous bear markets have followed a similar pattern.

If you're looking for a sanguine forecast of the US economic and market situation, it's best not to look to David Tice, chief investment officer at the $150 million Ranger Active Bear Fund (HDGE).

""I believe we will retest lows. I believe we will break through lows. I believe that we have a depression on our hands,"" he said on the ""Money Life with Chuck Jaffe"" podcast. ""This is not a standard, garden-variety recession.""

Tice's pessimistic view is perhaps unsurprising, given the fact that his fund makes money by selectively shorting stocks. But his outlook goes well beyond selective short-selling opportunities. He's worried about the economy and financial markets as a whole.

The CIO's stark economic prognostication rests upon a brigade of factors:

A depressed and frightened consumer

Disappearing jobs

A potential second coronavirus outbreak in the fall

Lack of a virus cure

Shrinking economic activity

Turmoil in small businesses

A stock market that is ""very, very expensive.""

All of these factors combine to make Tice believe that the worst for markets and the economy is yet to come. As for the ongoing rally off multiyear lows? Tice says he saw it coming, but he's not convinced it's built to last.

""This has been a retracement rally, and therefore we were expecting that,"" he said. ""Fibonacci tells us it should be between 38% and 63% on the retracement rally. We've had that. We've actually gone a little bit past that.""

For context, Fibonacci retracement levels are commonly used technical analysis indicators that attempt to pinpoint levels of support and resistance between price points. They're also used to forecast subsequent moves based on how an index responds to meeting these key thresholds.

The fundamental economic factors outlined above — combined with Tice's belief that the market's current rally is a mere head fake — informs his bearish outlook.

And Tice's lack of conviction in the ongoing rally is not without historical precedent. It's not uncommon for stocks to compulsively rally higher during longer bear markets. Michael Batnick, the director of research at Ritholtz Wealth Management, detailed this notion in a recent blog post.

Batnick noted that, over the last two bear markets, stocks experienced a number of false rallies — some over 20% — before running out of steam.

Provided below are two charts Batnick cites. The first details the S&P 500's behavior during the tech bubble of the early 2000s. In that two-year span, the S&P 500 rallied 12.1%, 7.7%, 8.6%, 19.0%, 20.7%, and another 20.7% — all on separate occasions — before eventually succumbing to the turmoil.

Here's the second chart detailing the S&P 500 during the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009. Investors experienced five false rallies in the midst of a greater bear.

""Even in the worst historical markets, stocks never went straight down,"" said Batnick. ""Often times there are several bear market rallies that give investor's a sigh of relief, only to see the carpet of hope ripped out right from underneath them.""

Tice agrees. And with all of that under consideration, he delivers a bleak final message.

""I believe that we are in a depression,"" Tice said. ""I believe that the longer-term consequences of this can't really be questioned.""

He concluded: ""Activity and feelings of consumers are going to change longer term by this outbreak of the China virus and that we have a lot more pain to go.""",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

The ad industry is going through a massive transformation, which has been accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic.

To chart out how companies are navigating through these challenges, Business Insider is launching a regular series where chief marketing officers take us through how they are using data, taking work in-house, creating new models with their agencies and tweaking their campaigns.

In the first installment, Greg Lyons, CMO at PepsiCo Beverages North America, discussed how Pepsi was investing in data and e-commerce in the long-term and shifting marketing budgets to operations in the short-term.

The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Tanya Dua: How has the pandemic changed the way you operate?

Greg Lyons: We're making more end-to-end decisions as a business, and less decisions as a marketing department in a silo. Decisions that was sometimes take weeks or months to make, we're making much more quickly now. The business is changing so fast, we've created some special projects to make us stronger coming out of this, and we're moving people around more than before to make sure that everyone's working on something that's valuable to the organization.

E-commerce is a big long-term focus for Pepsi

Dua: Can you share some of these projects?

Lyons: We saw that more people were buying food and beverages online than before so we shifted some of our marketing investment into e-commerce. E-commerce is a big growth platform for us, and [the pandemic] has probably accelerated that shift by three to five years. I'm talking the pure plays, like Amazon and Instacart, but also the click-and-collects like Walmart.com and Kroger.

Dua: Is Frito-Lay's e-commerce website Snacks.com that just launched part of that investment?



Lyons: We're trying to learn if product bundles make sense. And if they do, then do morning bundles, which have got a whole bunch of different PepsiCo products in them, make sense? I view it mostly as something small as opposed to a big new business opportunity for us.

Dua: How has your use of data changed?

Lyons: We've got first-party data for well over 25 million households, and we're trying to use that to make informed decisions in our marketing. Earlier, we'd have a code under the cap, and you could register your name to win a cool prize, and we'd have a database where we'd capture that data for the Pepsi brand. We'd do a different promotion on Doritos around gaming and capture that, and have data there. We weren't sharing that data across all the brands.

Over the last five years, we've become much more proactive in trying to get consumers' data in one usable data set. We're asking them if they want to hear from us and honoring that, making sure that it's robust enough so we understand how often people want to hear from us, what's important to them, and which brands they interact with the most. We're overlaying on top this idea of really understanding consumers not just as a data point but as humans.

Pepsi has changed its marketing and the scope of work for its agencies in the face of the pandemic

Dua: In a survey called ""The Empathy Imperative,"" Pepsi found 80% of customers say it's important that brands revise the tone or style of their advertising and communications during this time. How are you doing that?



Lyons: We had an ongoing summer campaign planned called ""#Summergram,"" which was about people going outside and enjoying summer with their friends and family. It would be tone-deaf right now if you got a bottle of Pepsi that said ""Suns out, Buns out."" So we've culled that. We also had some advertising that showed people enjoying themselves at basketball games, and that wasn't the right thing to show either. Instead, we're doing other types of marketing.



Dua: Like what?

Lyons: We partnered with the Global Citizen Festival on their ""One World Together"" event with Lady Gaga, and tried to help them however we could, whether it was designing the logo for the event or artist outreach, production or generating awareness. We partnered with John Krasinski on his show ""Some Good News,"" helping Guy Fieri help restaurant workers. We donated $3 million and became part of that show, and gave some people something to feel good about — in an authentic way — because Pepsi is part of a lot of restaurant experiences and we want to help those restaurants and those employees.

Dua: How has that impacted your marketing budget?



Lyons: It's very important to not go dark during this time. We made the decision to pause a fair amount of our media in the second quarter to help make sure that our business operations, our employees on our frontline, were safe. We took some of our marketing money and invested a little bit more in our operations. We've also increased their [operations staff] pay a little bit. We're still marketing our brands, but we've simplified our calendar. We think the ROI is going to be higher when the country reopens, so we're trying to keep as much flexibility with our marketing money as we possibly can in the third and fourth quarters.

Dua: How has that flexibility impacted your relationship with your agencies?



Lyons: It's very difficult to be an agency right now, as a lot of clients are cutting their spend. We're trying to be understanding of what they're going through. We're trying to be as transparent with them as possible as to where we're going to need their help. Depending on the agency, what they are working on, and how our plans have changed, we've changed scopes of work. We have not changed our payment terms. We need flexibility because things could change. If we have a big second wave [of the pandemic], our plans will probably be different than if we have a balanced recovery.

Dua: Do you think in-housing will accelerate as a result of the coronavirus?



Lyons: We've had some in-house creative capabilities for a while, and we used that team to create some of the awareness-building tactics that we did for the Global Citizen partnership. That being said, I do not think it accelerates in-housing. We need both agency partners that bring fresh thinking, real expertise in creative, and broad perspective across lots of brands and the industry, as well as in-house creative that can do things very quickly and be a creative resource for us.



Dua: What's your stance on blacklisting news during the crisis?



Lyons: During this pandemic, we have decided not to advertise on hard news, because we feel that it's depressing right now. But I would not call that blacklisting — we've just chosen not to do that for the time being.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

This story was originally published on May 5, 2020, by THE CITY.

Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance Jr. is blaming the coronavirus pandemic to justify dropping charges in a major construction fraud case tainted by allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, THE CITY has learned.

In what appears to be the first instance of COVID-19 knocking out a high-profile criminal prosecution in New York City, Vance revealed in court papers filed Monday that he won't put a key bribery case back before a grand jury.

That's because the actions of sitting grand juries have been suspended and no new panels have been convened since mid March when the coronavirus forced the shutdown of much of the state's court system.

The case dropped by Vance involved one of several defendants in a wide-ranging construction bribery prosecution that's now the subject of an internal review. At issue are accusations that the lead prosecutor in the case, Diana Florence, withheld evidence undermining her star witness.

One of those defendants was Henry Chlupsa, a former executive of an engineering firm charged with bribing the witness, a city bureaucrat, for inside information to win multi-million-dollar contracts.

Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Thomas Farber convicted Chlupsa in November following a three-week non-jury trial. Weeks later, Chlupsa's attorney, Nelson Boxer, learned that the DA's office had failed to turn over thousands of internal emails and interviews with the informant in which he claimed he never took bribes from anyone.

In January, Nelson asked Farber to vacate the conviction and dismiss the indictment.

Bid to 'conserve resources'

In a court filing Monday, Assistant District Attorney Kenneth Moore Jr. agreed the conviction should be vacated, conceding the DA's office hadn't handed over the disputed material as it should have.

Moore insisted, though, the criminal charges against Chlupsa were still viable. But because of the COVID-19 restrictions on grand juries, the DA decided not to bring a new case against the now 77-year-old Chlupsa, Moore said.

""In an effort to conserve resources, especially in light of the coronavirus pandemic, and for the other reasons described below, the People will not be seeking to re-present new charges against the defendant to a new grand jury,"" Moore wrote.

""In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, no new grand juries will be convened for the foreseeable future,"" he noted.

Under normal circumstances, grand juries — which in New York consist of 23 citizens meeting in a room to hear evidence — vote on whether to hand up an indictment.

An indictment is a formal allegation that must be resolved either by plea or trial. Law enforcement is required to bring a case to a grand jury within six days of arrest or release the defendant.

But with COVID-19 wreaking havoc on the criminal justice system and making it impossible for 23 New Yorkers to gather in a relatively small room, Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued an executive order suspending that rule. The state Office of Court Administration shut down grand juries until further notice.

Danny Frost, a spokesperson for Vance, said the Chlupsa case is the only major case dropped by the Manhattan DA so far due to the virus crisis.

Frost said prosecutors handling other ongoing grand jury investigations are still able to issue subpoenas and continue pursuing cases. But he acknowledged that because the grand juries cannot meet in person, they cannot vote to indict.

That's put all cases pending when the virus struck are now in a state of suspended animation. The stuck-in-time cases include major white collar fraud, public corruption and racketeering prosecutions.

Probes go on

It's not just a challenge for Vance's office: The city Department of Investigation, for instance, had multiple pending cases before grand juries when the virus all but shut courts.

Diane Struzzi, a DOI spokesperson, said Tuesday that the agency's investigators are finding ways to work around the frozen state of grand juries.

""Not convening grand juries has had an impact on how cases move forward, but that situation has not resulted in the abandonment of any DOI case or a slowdown in DOI's work,"" Struzzi said.

She added that DOI investigators are instead ""focusing on case aspects that can be accomplished consistent with remote work and social distancing.""

That's led to prioritizing investigations that involve a lot of email and records review over cases that require door-knocking and interviewing witnesses, Struzzi said.

The judge who convicted Chlupsa must still approve the motion to vacate that conviction.

On Tuesday, Boxer, Chlupsa's attorney, stated, ""After a long, hard fight, it's a big step towards justice for Henry.""

But he disagreed with the DA's assessment that it was still possible to bring a case against his client. Boxer contended the case was fatally damaged by the DA's office withholding of evidence.

The Chlupsa decision by Vance marked the second time charges against defendants in the big construction bribery case overseen by Florence have been tossed. In February, another judge threw out the case against another engineer, Kyriacos Pierides, calling the scope of the withheld evidence in that case ""staggering.""

As THE CITY revealed in January, Florence resigned from the DA's office and was replaced as head of Vance's Construction Fraud Task Force. Vance has said his office is reviewing the handling of the bribery case — scrutiny that Frost said Tuesday was ongoing.

Florence has said she turned over the material as soon as she learned of its existence. In her resignation letter, she charged she faced a ""hostile work environment,"" ""bullying"" and interference with pending legal cases while for Vance.

Boris Johnson's government closed down the hospitality industry as part of the coronavirus lockdown.

The closure of fish and chip shops has put chipping potato farmers in a nightmare situation.

In a best-case scenario, there are expected to be 95,000 tonnes of surplus chipping potatoes in July.

Farmers are struggling to work out what to do with them, with limited options available.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Britain's farmers are struggling to work out what to do with tens of thousands of tonnes of spare potatoes when their season ends this summer after the closure of fish and chip shops during the lockdown triggered a collapse in demand.

The UK government's decision in March to close large parts of the economy to contain the spread of the coronavirus halted the hospitality industry, with restaurants, some takeaways, pubs, cafes, and bars all forced to shut their doors.

That caused a sharp drop in demand for several foods produced in Britain. That demand has not yet picked back up, with many out-of-home businesses not selling food, and others are operating at a significantly reduced capacity.

The closure of fish and chip shops — a traditional British business — has been acutely felt by UK potato farmers.

The Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) estimates that in a best-case scenario, there will be 95,000 tonnes of spare chipping potatoes piled up in stores across Britain at the end of this farming season.

Growers face a major dilemma in figuring out how to deal with this huge surplus of chipping potatoes.

The stores must be empty in time for July, when growers begin work on next season's produce. They are currently full of unwanted potatoes, with very few ways of getting rid of them available to growers.

Growers plan to donate part of the supply to food banks and charities. Some of the potatoes will become cattle feed where possible, and small amounts will be broken down using an industrial process called anaerobic digestion.

However, those measures combined will probably only have a limited impact, the ADHB's Robert Clayton told Business Insider.

""It won't get rid of the surplus, but it will help,"" he said. ""It's a real head-scratcher.""

The financial impact is also set to be significant. The average cost of producing a single tonne is £140, Clayton said.

The National Farmers Union's Alex Godfrey said, ""the closure of fish and chip shops and fast food outlets at the end of March deprived hundreds of thousands of tonnes of potatoes already in store of their planned routes to market.""

Godfrey, a potato grower who chairs the NFU's Potato Forum, told Business Insider: ""Longer-term impacts on the industry are hard to judge, but good, solid businesses have been rocked. I hope they don't tip over.""

It's not just growers of chipping potatoes who are struggling. The closure of fast food outlets in response to the COVID-19 outbreak has left farmers with similarly large piles of spare processed potatoes used to make fries.

A spokesperson for the Potato Processors' Association told Business Insider: ""We have seen volumes of chilled and frozen products, which were intended for food service, fall dramatically. Out-of-home sales have completely stopped.

""Whilst some product can be repurposed or repackaged, the increase in retail sales cannot compensate for the loss of the food service channels and this has led to a reduction in demand for processing raw materials.""

British farmers fear European potatoes could cross the channel

Potatoes are among several foods that are currently in oversupply in Britain.

Brits are being urged to eat more steak after the closure of the hospitality industry led to a collapse in demand for beef. There is also a surplus of milk and wheat, the Food and Drink Federation told Business Insider.

The impact of lockdown measures on potato farmers is being felt in mainland Europe too.

In Belgium, farmers are urging people to eat fries twice a week, the BBC reported, with around 750,000 tonnes of potatoes sat in warehouses across the country due to a sharp drop in demand.

Farmers in the UK fear producers in Belgium and elsewhere will attempt to export their surplus potatoes to Britain.

""The problem is much worse in mainland Europe,"" the AHDB's Clayton told Business Insider.

""What that means is there is the potential for millions of tons of frozen potatoes to come over the channel and bleed out into the British market at a cost so low that it would totally undermine British producers.

""It's making the whole situation a lot more frightening.""

A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs told Business Insider: ""We are working closely with our potato growers both to support them through this year's planting season.

""We have relaxed competition rules so our farmers can help to feed the nation during these unprecedented circumstances and we are supporting them to sell their produce to different markets as well as being ready to supply restaurants when they reopen.""",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

And almost two-thirds of US adults said that if they had coronavirus symptoms, concerns over out-of-pocket costs would be an important factor into whether or not they decided to go to a doctor.

Even before disaster struck, the US' employer-based health insurance model created a byzantine system that made reimbursement for even basic services maddeningly difficult.

A socialized healthcare system is a non-starter in the US, but the current system that ties health coverage to employment and to a profit-driven third party has created a social safety net full of massive holes.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The US health insurance model is broken and the pandemic could be its moment of reckoning.

COVID-19 isn't exposing new flaws, per se, but the sudden shift in healthcare coverage for millions of Americans is going to throw in stark relief just how bad things have gotten.

But before that, let's remember just how much of a mess even simple things are. I'll use myself, healthy and insured, as an example.

Run-of-the-mill brokenness

I went to get a measles-mumps-rubella inoculation prior to a trip last year to Israel, which had been in the midst of a measles outbreak.

The MMR vaccine is about as basic as preventative health care gets. Babies start receiving it as early as six months. It's essentially required for college students.

Due to logistical issues with my doctor, I had to pay out of pocket for the vaccine but I was assured by my insurer that the cost would be reimbursed.

I wouldn't be fully reimbursed for nearly six months.

During that period I spent at least 10 hours on the phone with my insurance company, and also filed and re-filed paperwork and receipts scanned to PDFs (because cameraphone scans would simply not do), before eventually moving on to filing appeals after my first attempts at reimbursement were rejected.

It was a duel where the only way to win was to outlast my opponent. While I eventually was reimbursed, it amounted to taking on a second unpaid job to get my own money back for a completely legitimate medical expense. And this was all while enrolled in the highest-tier healthcare available under my employer's plan.

A lot of people would have just given up, a result that would not displease the insurance companies.

That was a simpler time, one of international air travel and in-person elective doctor visits.

A coronavirus-sized gap in the social safety net

As the country closes in on Great Depression-levels of unemployment, the employer-based health insurance model is also facing a potential reckoning.

About half of the US relies on employer-based health insurance. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates about 27 million Americans and their dependents either have lost or will soon lose access to their health insurance as a result of the coronavirus-driven economic chaos.

The good news is that about 80% of them will be to get coverage through Medicaid or can get access to a subsidized plan through the Affordable Care Act's exchanges (which President Trump recently reiterated he still wants to kill, despite the pandemic afflicting his constituents).

The bad news is that still leaves about 5.7 million Americans ineligible for Medicaid or a subsidized ACA plan, which means they could be paying shockingly high prices for coverage or have to go without it entirely. In our ""take care of yourself"" culture, these were people who had been doing it ""the right way.""

And these insurance losses could exacerbate the health risk of the pandemic. Almost two-thirds of adults said ""the potential out-of-pocket costs would be very or somewhat important in their decision to get care if they had symptoms of the coronavirus,"" according to an April report by The Commonwealth Fund.

So right when we want people to go to the doctor and get tested swiftly to limit the spread of the virus, millions of more Americans are left weighing whether getting their cough checked out is worth the cost.

This shouldn't happen in any advanced country, much less one as rich as ours, where we throw state and federal subsidies at any number of private ventures on the pretense that they ""create jobs.""

The old argument over whether a person should go bankrupt because of a broken leg is obsolete. The new argument is whether a person should go bankrupt because a pandemic destroyed their ability to earn a living is the one we need to have.

Americans are all over the place with how they feel about healthcare

Even with the social safety net disaster we currently face, a fully-socialized ""Medicare for All"" healthcare system with no private options is a non-starter in the US, and for good reason.

Far more than healthcare would be at stake. It would dramatically redefine both the economy and the role of government. Moreover, its most vocal proponents have never quite been able to articulate how to offset the plan's high cost.

The push-pull of a broken system and roughly-defined alternatives have left Americans confused about what they want out of the system. Polls show that about three-quarters of Americans like their health insurance. But a majority favor a national health system. Though that number drops if it means replacing private insurance.

As a country, we're completely all over the place with how we feel about healthcare.

We don't want to end up rationing healthcare like they do in countries with socialized medicine. But we already do that here through a public/private hybrid system that hinges on the participation of a profit-driven third party.

It's a byzantine system that requires — among many other barriers — pre-authorizations by primary care physicians, pointless consultation appointments that could easily be done electronically before critical procedures, and any number of regulations that make some of the best doctors choose to simply opt-out of accepting any insurance at all, leaving their services only available to the wealthiest patients.

Then there's the out-of-pocket costs that some people can't afford to make, or don't want to risk laying out upfront out of the very reasonable fear that their health insurance company will make it virtually impossible to be reimbursed.

In reality, it's more likely that Americans like their doctors and know that a change in insurance could mean those doctors will no longer be available to them.

Former President Barack Obama knew that, too, which is why he made the false promise that ""if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.""

While the ACA (a.k.a Obamacare) increased the number of insured Americans, it doubled-down on the third-party insurance system whose vulnerabilities have never been more evident than during the pandemic.

The figure of 27 million Americans suddenly scrambling to find health coverage is a disaster and the disturbing data showing a majority of Americans are too frightened to seek treatment even if they're showing symptoms of COVID-19 is proof that the system has failed.

The French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi has reneged on its pledge to give the US priority access to a coronavirus vaccine it's developing after a backlash from the highest levels of French government.

CEO Paul Hudson had said on Wednesday that because the US had spent millions of dollars to support Sanofi's work on a vaccine, it ""has the right to the largest preorder."" Sanofi is developing two vaccines, neither of which has been approved for use yet.

Hudson's logic was met with outrage in France and across the European Union.

A vaccine is ""a global public good, which is not submitted to market forces,"" the office of President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday.

Prime Minister Edouard Philippe echoed those sentiments, tweeting: ""Equal access for all to vaccine is not negotiable.""

For Philippe, it was also a matter of loyalty to France. ""I just reminded Serge Weinberg who chairs Sanofi that this is a great deeply French company,"" he also said.

On Friday, Weinberg, the chairman of Sanofi's board of directors, intervened.

""I am going to be extremely clear: There will be no particular advance for any country,"" Weinberg told France 2 TV.

Macron had also been ""affected"" by Hudson's interview, a source told Bloomberg. The Sanofi CEO has been summoned to meet with Macron next Tuesday.

Sanofi has long received US government funding from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.

On February 18, Sanofi announced a new partnership with BARDA, with a new $30 million cash injection to help the search for a vaccine. At the time, Sanofi had already been working on a vaccine by leveraging its research on SARS, another respiratory disease.

Hudson told Bloomberg earlier this week that because the US was first to fund Sanofi's research, it expected ""that if we've helped you manufacture the doses at risk, we expect to get the doses first.""

As a result of the collaboration with BARDA, Hudson said the US could ""expect to get the doses first"" in return for its support.

Critics of the arrangement have pointed out that Sanofi benefits from tax credits from the French state.

The French Socialist Party estimates the French government has saved Sanofi at least 150 million euros, or $162 million, in recent years, the BBC reported.

On Thursday, 140 world leaders signed an open letter calling for a vaccine to be universally available and not patented.

""Governments and international partners must unite around a global guarantee which ensures that, when a safe and effective vaccine is developed, it is produced rapidly at scale and made available for all people, in all countries, free of charge,"" the letter said.

Stefan de Keersmaecker, a spokesman for the European Commission, told Agence France-Presse: ""The vaccine against COVID-19 should be a global public good and its access needs to be equitable and universal.""

A Sanofi representative told Business Insider's Bryan Pietsch on Wednesday that the company was committed to making its vaccine ""accessible to everyone"" should it prove effective.

The person said partnering with BARDA allowed the company ""to initiate production as early as possible while we continue to develop and register the vaccine.""

Vaccines would be distributed in areas where they are produced, the person added.

There is a way to prevent the slow growth problem: Congress needs to pass more stimulus.

US economic activity has started to bounce from its COVID-19 recession lows, but focus on short-term improvements ignores the pain that could stick around for years to come.

A wide variety of high-frequency data indicators from airport passenger volumes to demand for gasoline to applications home loans have all bounced as Renaissance Macro economist Neil Dutta wrote last week, and companies are also reporting encouraging trends in late April through early May.

That's good news, and a sign that the combined support from Congress and the Federal Reserve has prevented the worst-case scenario, while the gradual reopening of the economy allows for some consumer activity that wasn't feasible before.

Taking a step back, however, reveals a deeply concerning picture.

A lesson from the financial crisis

From 1947 to 2007, per capita real GDP of the US economy rose very predictably and steadily over time by about 2.2% per person per year.

But following the last global crisis, instead of returning to that steady trend, output shifted to a lower gear. CUNY economist JW Mason has identified the huge difference between the old trend and the new one as a policy failure that could have been avoided.

That shortfall in real GDP has huge consequences over the long-term. By the fourth quarter of 2019, it meant the standard of living (roughly proxied by the level of GDP per person) Americans enjoyed was over 20% lower than it would have been if the country returned to its post-World War II, pre-2007 trend.

The concern for the US economy now is not whether easing lockdowns lead to more activity than during the depth of the lockdown, but whether the climb in economic activity returns to the pre-pandemic trend or not.

Returning to the post-2009 trend is much easier than to the pre-2008 trend; it requires just 1.6% per person real output growth per year, lower hanging fruit than the 2.2% from pre-crisis.

But there is a lingering question about whether the country can achieve that relatively modest goal.

There are three primary reasons.

The destruction of small businesses

First, the permanent closure of businesses, especially small businesses. A team of economists from the University of Chicago published a paper last week that suggested 40% of job losses through April were thanks to permanent business shutdowns.

When businesses close, workers can get re-hired elsewhere and owner-operators can find new sources of income, but the process of re-hiring and finding new income is slowed relative to if the business simply re-opens its doors. Therefore a bounce-back in activity may be slowed by fewer businesses being able to reopen.

Weak investment

Second, capital expenditures. A huge range of companies ranging from tech giants like Facebook or Microsoft to oil producers like Exxon Mobil or Occidental have reduced their planned capital expenditures — investments in big ticket items like new facilities or equipment — for 2020.

That foregone capex is both lost income for suppliers of companies, but it also means that future economic gains from that new equipment or factory are lost.

Weak post-financial crisis capex was one widely-cited reason for slow growth. The economy never saw investment rise above 5% of GDP in the last cycle (net of depreciation), which is usually the low point during previous recessions.

Low investment and low growth are a mutually reinforcing cycle — if there is low growth then companies are less likely to feel comfortable spending on big projects, but the lack of this capital investment then limits the ability of the economy to grow. This vicious cycle has kept growth low following the last crisis and we may be on that path again.

Hampered state and local governments

Thirdly, state and local governments are running out of funds to support their citizens.

Most state and local governments have some form of mandate to run balanced operating budgets, so when tax receipts fall, outlays must as well. These governments cut a million jobs in April (70% of which were education-related) and will continue to shrink their workforces as long as sales and income tax receipts lag.

Ongoing contraction from governments, who are crucial employers and economic actors, will weigh on the whole country's economic bounce.

Potential good news

While this may seem quite gloomy, there are some offsetting factors.

The stock market's recent bounce is actually good news for capex. Rising stock prices send a signal to management teams that they can continue investing in their businesses, and the recent pop in prices is likely to reassure businesses that the coast is clear.

Second, the US is projected to run a budget deficit totalling roughly 12% of GDP this year, with billions of dollars in stimulus checks, lots of credit to keep businesses from shuttering (including PPP loan/grants and Fed lending programs), and big top-ups to weekly unemployment insurance checks.

If businesses don't actually shutter thanks to PPP and other programs, and if consumers are being provided enough cash to spend when they're able, it's possible the economy can return to the pre-coronavirus trend; that's what a BlackRock analysis from April suggests will happen.

But the biggest way to ensure the US economy bounces back is further federal government action. More stimulus in the form of cash distributions to households would lead to higher demand that gives businesses a reason to invest more than they otherwise would, and state and local government budget holes can easily be filled by the federal government via new legislation.

A new relief package unveiled on Tuesday by House Democrats does much to fill the gap, offering more cash distributions to households and plugging holes in state and local government operating budgets.

Taking these steps would help sustain the trajectory of growth into a true V-shape that returns US output to the post-2008 trend or even better starts a path towards the higher, post-war trend which we've been below for so long",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

When he was a businessman, putting crucial responsibilities on the shoulders of hapless sycophants only affected his bottom line. Now that he's leader-of-the-free-world, it's a life-and-death issue.

Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, has been running a shadow coronavirus task force that was supposed to secure personal protective equipment (PPE) for hospitals and essential workers.

It failed, mostly because it was comprised of business people with no experience in science or medicine.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

President Donald Trump trusts his cronies.

He relies on those who flatter him, never challenge him, and put his interests first. Qualifications are secondary, if considered at all.

His response to the pandemic has been no different, as cronies have presided over his administration's coronavirus response, to disastrous results.

It's not just that he's whittled down his cabinet and administration of any voices that put the country's interest ahead of his own, it's that the sycophants who remain have no business managing a health crisis.

A history of loyalty over competence

Before he got in the leading-the-free-world business, he ran a ""family business"" called the Trump Organization.

The Trump kids obviously had a leg up on the competitions. but there were plenty of executives who, as The New York Times put it in 2016, ""secured power not necessarily through fancy pedigrees or impressive credentials, but through decades of devotion to their boss.""

One of these executives, Trump Organization chief operating officer, caught Trump's eye in 1981 ""after Mr. Trump saw him eject some hecklers while working security at the United States Open tennis tournament,"" according to The Times.

Upon entering the White House, Trump made sure to bring cronies along for the ride.

Now Trump is presiding over a country undergoing the most devastating economic collapse (with no end in sight) since the Great Depression as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, and instead of experts who could execute strategies to save lives, we're stuck with cronies..

Catastrophe of the cronies

When Trump belatedly set up his coronavirus task force in late February, he put together a team where only four of the seventeen members had backgrounds in science or medicine. But he did include National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, a former Wall Street economist and CNBC host with a spotty at best track record on actually understanding the economy.

At the time of the appointment — again this is late February — Kudlow went on CNBC to assure the public that the administration had the virus contained ""pretty close to airtight"" and that any potential outbreak might be a ""human tragedy"" but probably not an ""economic tragedy.""

About two weeks later, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 a pandemic, and the unraveling of the economy began. It continues unabated two months later.

Though Vice President Mike Pence is officially in charge of the administration's task force, Trump's ultimate crony, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, has been running his own ""shadow"" task force.

It's not the first time Kushner, the rich kid who failed in his own attempt at real estate baronhood, has been tasked by the president with leading sweeping projects far above his pay grade.

Kushner's unofficial task force consists of a volunteer squad of business associates. They've been focused on maintaining and strengthening supply chains during the pandemic, particularly the procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE) for hospitals and essential workers.

The idea was that these bright young captains of industry would be able to use their private sector ingenuity to cut through the red tape inherent in government bureaucracy. And because they're volunteers and not paid employees of the government, they are essentially not subject to oversight.

The volunteers, who Kushner calls ""true patriots,"" have failed spectacularly.

As The Times reported, Kushner's team ""had little to no experience with government procurement procedures or medical equipment."" Some ""were told to prioritize tips on PPE availability from political allies and associates of President Trump"" — including Fox News hosts Brian Kilmeade and Jeannine Pirro, the young Trumpist activist Charlie Kirk of Turning Point USA, and ""a former ""Apprentice"" contestant who now works for the Trump campaign.

Almost none of the leads panned out. At least one led to a $69 million contract that yielded no equipment at all.

The incompetence so appalled Dr. Richard Bright of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (which reports to the Department of Health and Human Services) that he filed an 89-page whistleblower complaint. Bright is scheduled to testify before a House committee this Thursday.

This isn't a business

Trump, still obsessed with his television ratings and distracted by his prolonged Twitter rages, is failing pretty much every test of leadership during a global catastrophe. But if he were merely asleep at the wheel and left the machinery in the hands of capable people, the government's pandemic response might not be failing so appallingly.

Former FEMA deputy administrator Tim Manning told the Times, ""There's an old saying in emergency management — disaster is the wrong time to exchange business cards.""

Trump's penchant for cronyism kept him insulated from reality as a businessman, and perhaps as a result, his track record in business is little more than a long list of failures. To survive these financial calamities, Trump relied on bankruptcy, celebrity, and just stiffing the people who worked for him.

There's no hiding from the consequences of the pandemic. And it's not just contractors and creditors who are getting hurt by Trump's incompetence, it's the entire country.

In the age of the coronavirus, Trump's unqualified cronies are wasting precious time and resources. Lives are at stake and the margin for error is minuscule.

From the breakdown of the PPE supply chain, the failure to set up a broad and effective testing system, and the prioritization of keeping the economy going over issuing social distancing guidelines — Trump's ""best people"" have shown they're completely in over their head. The US response to the coronavirus was one of the worst in the world.

The difference between basic competence and whatever it is we have now has caused an unnecessary loss of life.

If he were capable of admitting his own fealty, he'd admit his ""best people"" have failed and prioritize the guidance of experts — or at least, the experienced — in the fields of science and medicine.

But that's not who Trump is. He doesn't make mistakes, in his own mind.

The facts don't lie, though. Trump's cronyism is dangerous and costing lives.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

SUMMARY: Republicans are mumbling about the deficit and pretending they won't sign another huge stimulus bill, but of course they will. Musk taunts California, flirts with Colorado. The Supreme Court won't let us see Trump's secrets before the election. That weird revenge-porn scandal is going to cost Democrats a House seat. Quarantine fatigue is real, and California's in a tough spot. Yes, masks are annoying, but they work — too bad our president is too vain to wear one.

Why Republicans will grumble about another big stimulus bill, then pass it

From left, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., and House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., appear for a Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony honoring the Office of Strategic Services in Emancipation Hall on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, March 21, 2018. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Pressure is building for another big federal stimulus. This morning Fed Chair Jerome Powell — in that very measured, not-using-any-scary-words Fed-Chair-style way — practically begged Congress for massive spending now to reduce damage later.

Meanwhile, Speaker Pelosi rolled out a $3 trillion relief bill. The Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act would give nearly $1 trillion to state and local governments to cover their urgent shortfalls, fund more contact tracing, and send another relief check to most Americans. House Democrats could pass the HEROES Act soon as Friday. (In the dismal tradition of ludicrous acronyms, the HEROES Act outdoes even the CARES Act.)

The Democratic bill has no chance in the Republican-controlled Senate. Majority Leader McConnell's circle has derided it as a liberal wish list, and indicated they're in no rush to act.

This isn't surprising: McConnell is a good enough poker player to know that he should deride the House bill as much as possible for as long as possible, even if he's eventually planning to negotiate a compromise.

What's more interesting is that there's a rising tide of Republican concern about the deficit. The April deficit mushroomed to $738 billion, by far a monthly record. Some Republicans say they want spending cuts to partially offset any new stimulus, or don't think there should be any stimulus at all.

Republicans get very concerned about deficits when a Democrat is president, but rarely show the same concern when a Republican is, so it's surprising that they'd get frugal under President Trump.

Given record-low interest rates and the economic catastrophe, economists pretty much agree that massive government spending is the best, and perhaps only, way to prevent a long-lasting depression.

This presents a fun political and philosophical puzzle.

The best thing for Republican electoral prospects in a November is a stabilized economy. The best thing for Democratic electoral prospects is an economy in ruins.

Yet we have the odd spectacle of Democrats pushing for massive federal relief that would almost certainly improve electoral prospects for Republicans, and some Republicans grumbling about it. Politicians in both parties are proposing to act against their own political interests to uphold their principles.

I suspect that both sides will end up supporting massive stimulus. Democrats will support it because they ideologically believe in it. They will also support it because they know that even if they do end up winning the White House, Republicans would certainly block large-scale stimulus by a theoretical President Biden in 2021, so Democrats should get what they can now.

And Republicans will shush the deficit hawks. They won't go for the whole $3 trillion Democrats are asking for, but they'll agree to a big bill — another trillion or two — because they know they can't survive the election without it. — DP

Musk wins his showdown with California

Tesla CEO Elon Musk restarted the company's Fremont, California car factory earlier this week, in defiance of the local county's coronavirus restrictions. He also sued the county and threatened to move Tesla's headquarters and plant out of California.

Now, sticking to the Musk-Trump Twitter playbook, Musk is taunting California by openly flirting with the Governor of Colorado.

Meanwhile, Musk's bold move to reopen appears to have prompted California's Alameda county to agree to let him reopen. Tesla and Alameda were close to a deal anyway — the plan was to open next week — but Musk's Twitter bludgeon and defiance have bought the company a few more days of production and a lot of publicity.

Two takeaways: First, Twitter bullying works — Musk and Trump do it for a reason. Second, Musk and Tesla had better hope Tesla workers don't get sick. Bashing bureaucrats is charismatic. Killing employees isn't. — HB

The Supreme Court probably won't let us see Trump's financial records before the election.

It seems unlikely that the Supreme Court will force Trump's bankers and accountants to hand over his financial records to Congress before the election.

Yesterday's arguments — perhaps the most important SCOTUS hearings about presidential power in a generation — covered cases in which the House of Representatives (in one instance) and a New York state prosecutor (in another) demanded records about Trump's convoluted financial holdings.

Conservative justices seemed skeptical of the idea that the House could demand any information it wants from the president, worrying that could set the stage for partisan harassment, while most of the liberal justices pointed to the historically vast authority Congress has to investigate and demand documents in order to craft legislation.

Legal scholars generally agreed that the lawyer for the House botched the argument, and that SCOTUS seemed unlikely to rule directly against the president.

One predicted outcome: The justices set some new limits on when and how Congress can demand records from the president, and kick it back to the lower courts to decide if Congress has met those limits. That would push off any resolution — and any potential public release of Trump's extremely controversial records — until long after the election.

According to the New York Times, at least, the court was more sympathetic to the state prosecutor seeking Trump's records in his criminal case. But even if SCOTUS rules in the prosecutor's favor, grand jury secrecy rules would bar those records from being made public.

That will mean that President Trump, breaking decades of precedent, will have successfully prevented Americans from knowing what kind of partnerships, tax deals, and debts he has, and whether they're corrupting his presidency.

Americans deserve that knowledge, and it's dangerous that they will vote in November without it. — DP

That weird revenge-porn scandal probably cost the Democrats a congressional seat in California.

Democrat Christy Smith, left, and Republican Mike Garcia, right, are vying in the competitive special election for California's 25th congressional district AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli, File, AP Photo/Michael Blood

In a special election, Republican Mike Garcia leads Democrat Christy Smith by 13 percentage points, though the results won't be finalized for several days, after thousands of late-arriving mailed-in ballots are counted. The winner will serve out the rest of the year in the seat vacated by Katie Hill, who resigned in a strange alleged revenge-porn scandal.

This would be a rare Republican win in California, where the GOP holds only six of the 53 House seats, but it's risky to read too much into the results. Garcia is a Latino, a former Navy pilot, and a political novice, all of which likely helped him.

The district voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and is trending Democratic, but in the special election Smith didn't have a national Democrat at the top of the ticket to help boost turnout. The same two candidates will probably meet again in November. — DP

California — and the US — are increasingly in a tough spot

California daily coronavirus cases are still growing and is starting to pass New York's over the past few days. Meanwhile, many residents of the state have had it with ""shelter in place"" and are coming closer to open defiance of government restrictions.

California:

New York:

The US cannot extend lockdowns indefinitely. Americans won't stand for it. As Harvard professor Julia Marcus writes in the Atlantic, ""quarantine fatigue"" is real, and no amount of shaming or admonishment will change that. States and cities must develop and communicate clear plans for reopening, and they need to start relaxing restrictions soon.

The point of lockdowns, after all, was not to shut everything down until the virus disappeared. We missed our chance to eliminate the virus back in January and February, when our government blew the initial response.

The point of lockdowns was to buy time to protect our healthcare system and increase our testing and tracing capacity and medical supplies. The fact that the federal government and many states have failed to do this will not pacify those who are increasingly desperate to resume their lives. — HB

America's self-defeating idiocy is revealed in the politicization of mask-wearing

President Donald Trump participates in a tour of a Honeywell International plant that manufactures personal protective equipment, Tuesday, May 5, 2020, in Phoenix. AP Photo/Evan Vucci One of the biggest tragedies of the US situation — one that will make reopening more difficult — is the absurd politicization of mask-wearing.

Yes, it sucks to wear a mask. They're uncomfortable and hot. They're un-photogenic. They're annoying.

But masks are also simple and plentiful. And the evidence suggests that they help. In fact, if everyone wore masks, we might be able to relax other restrictions and resume more of our lives.

Unfortunately some of the loudest and most visible voices clamoring for the country to reopen — here's looking at you, Mr. President — have decided masks are wimpy, ugly, and un-American. So there's little hope for country-wide adoption of this simple solution. — HB

And guess what? They treated each other gloriously.

They divided up the work, gave themselves time-outs when they quarreled, fashioned a makeshift coconut guitar to keep themselves entertained, nursed a boy back to health when he fell and broke his leg, and built a fire and kept it burning for a year. It's the most inspiring thing I've read this week. —DP

On Plotz's view that, far from being exceptional, America is actually mediocre...

America's exceptionalism is about the rights of the individual

American exceptionalism is based upon our moral belief in the many and broad rights of the individual. It is not based on whether or not we are similarly susceptible to a disease.

Is it the case that most Americans are still ethical enough to believe in and fight for the many and broad rights of the individual to life, liberty, property, the right to earn a living, the right to choose one's own values, the right to manage one's own life, and the right to pursue one's own happiness? Apparently not. Such Americans have long been a minority. In that regard, we have lost much of our exceptionalism, though we still do much surpass most of the peoples of the world.

The fact that we do have a higher regard than most people still for individual rights is the basis for most of our greater security and the greater richness of our lives in the many options and choices available to us.

President Donald Trump has found a way forward for his administration in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, and it comes straight from the Soviet playbook.

It looks like this: Declare victory over a problem, and then lie and obfuscate no matter how clear it becomes that the problem still remains.

That's it. That's the plan, if you can call it a plan. To be more accurate you might call it a performance. Trump is acting out a reality different from the one that exists before the eyes of many Americans, and his gamble is that the performance will be so strong — helped along by the instruments of his office and surrogates in politics and the media — that Americans will leave the reality they see and join his fantasy.

This imposition on reality is something you see more often in totalitarian regimes, like the Soviet Union, where leaders also use the threat of violence to reinforce their narratives. It's a magical thinking that allows leaders to abdicate their responsibility to take care of society and focus only on hoarding political power. Now Trump is using it to avoid the painful work of governing during a pandemic.

It will be a difficult task. With more than 80,000 Americans dead from COVID-19 and hot spots reappearing in China, Singapore, and South Korea, we are starting to see that this virus will not give up without a fight. It will be a fight many will be unable to wish away.

Declaring victory mid-pandemic

The White House declaration of victory over the coronavirus is upon us. At a press conference on Monday, Trump said the US had ""prevailed"" in ramping up testing and congratulated his administration on its accomplishments. Soon, he told reporters, every American who wanted to get a test could get a test — a promise he made back in March that has yet to be fulfilled.

For weeks Trump has been pressing aggressively for the country to reopen economically, even though the White House's own projections see cases continuing to rise through May. And already the Trump administration is trying to decide on a ""final death count"" (though people are still, and will still be, dying of COVID-19).

The cover-up of the Trump administration's pitiful handling of the coronavirus is upon us too. The White House has limited the ability of key members of the White House coronavirus task force, like Dr. Anthony Fauci, to testify to the Democrat-controlled House about the pandemic response. A whistleblower has filed a complaint accusing the administration of downplaying the coronavirus from the beginning and failing to adequately prepare in the early stages of the pandemic.

During testimony on Tuesday to a Senate committee, Fauci told Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts point-blank: ""If you think we have it under control, we don't."" This is the kind of display — a kind of injection of reality — that the White House has tried to prevent.

The failures continue. The White House developed guidelines to help states determine when to reopen, but some states are opening even though the guidelines haven't been met. Based on Trump's actions, though, it's clear he couldn't care less. Last month the White House shelved a more detailed and rigorous step-by-step guide from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how to reopen safely, according to the Associated Press. Those guidelines were supposed to be released last Friday, but the White House thought they were too stringent.

All of this denial just adds danger to this disaster. It will only make those who accept Trump's fantasy much more cavalier with their health and the health of those around them.

What should be a federally coordinated effort to get all 50 states through this pandemic, guided by public-health officials working with the facts at hand has become a political litmus test for loyalty to Trump. In Congress — the branch meant to have oversight over the government — the GOP is complaining that the creation of a coronavirus oversight committee is a partisan witch hunt against the president.

Americans — who are seeing millions of jobs get destroyed and are making massive sacrifices to get through the pandemic — apparently don't have the right to ask questions about what went wrong in the initial response to the outbreak. Facts are not welcome here.

Dreams of a demagogue

Trump is doing exactly what incompetent autocrats do when they don't have solutions. They pretend the problem doesn't exist.

Trump can't get the coronavirus under control. He doesn't have the pain tolerance, work ethic, or skill to deal with this. Neither do most of the rest of the people working for him.

He'd rather be golfing, so he's going to construct a reality in which he can get back to doing just that. That reality will then be passed to us through White House briefings and Fox News and other right-wing media. They will continue to insist that the belief or disbelief of the pandemic's severity is a political act rather than a factual matter.

This reality-distortion phenomenon works in authoritarian nations because governments have the power to impose their version of events on society. While Trump has only partial control over the media and Congress, authoritarians have full control over the media and the levers of power. With those tools in hand authoritarians can ensure that any other account of what transpired is simply not given any oxygen, no matter how true it might be. Citizens are forced to accept a reality that contradicts what they're seeing right in front of their faces because they have no choice.

The Soviets succeeded in imposing their reality on society by weaving the ideology of into the fabric of everyday life. Everything was seen through a political lens. Children were taught to emulate Stalin-era folk heroes, whose great acts of valor were turning in any family members who showed signs of wavering from the Communist Party. Holidays were all political — just a means to reinforce the regime's ideology and box out opposing narratives.

And this imposition of reality mostly worked, even when it came to massive events. It allowed Josef Stalin to hide an empire-wide famine that killed 5 million people across the Soviet Union in 1932 and 1933. Statistics were altered, the media (even foreign correspondents) made no noise, and citizens were scared to talk about it.

""Officially, there was no famine,"" William Henry Chamberlin, the Moscow correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor at the time, said, but ""to anyone who lived in Russia in 1933 and who kept his eyes and ears open, the historicity of the famine is simply not in question.""

Of course, there are events that transcend this subjugation of material fact. The Soviets tried to use their reality-distortion field during the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, for example, but the problem was simply too big for them to lie away.

In the coming months we'll see how many Americans are sucked into Trump's version of that reality-distortion field.

He has taken the autocratic step of making the coronavirus political, thus injecting politics into everyday life in a way most Americans have never experienced. He's using textbook tricks to confuse people about what's going on — like questioning the coronavirus death toll, blaming China for all his failures, and refusing to acknowledge issues with supplies at hospitals around the country.

Trump claimed that he's the ""king of ventilators."" In reality he's the emperor of wearing no clothes.

Sure, Trump's most devoted supporters are likely to join his reality simply because they want to. It won't matter what's going on around them. The rest of this country, though, will have to square what Trump has said and done (or is saying and doing) with the world around them — with a rising national death toll and with sick friends, neighbors, and relatives they're worried about.

They'll have to wear masks, keep washing their hands, and work from home if they're lucky enough to be able to. Their day-to-day lives will change until there's a coronavirus vaccine, no matter what Trump says or does.

So for some Americans, joining Trump's coronavirus-free fantasy will not be an option. ""Reality,"" a former president said in a time that seems long, long ago, ""has a way of asserting itself.""",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

SUMMARY: Is this the end of American exceptionalism? Elon Musk's factory gambit. Why Ohio's governor is so popular. Jogging while white. What airports will be like, post-pandemic. Can we just give up on business travel forever?

Has the pandemic finally crushed the idea of American exceptionalism?

""Everybody gets a trophy.""

That's a favorite scornful phrase among conservatives who think America's being weakened by liberal affirmation culture. Critics of affirmation culture say that ""everybody gets a trophyism"" is delusional because it doesn't face the honest fact that some people, some organizations, some countries do things better than others.

During the pandemic, it's those who usually deride affirmation culture who are falling victim to it. The story that President Trump and many of his allies are telling about America's pandemic response is that we're doing an amazing job. On Monday, the president announced that we had triumphed over the pandemic. ""We have met the moment and we have prevailed,"" he said, later saying that he was referring to the growth of US testing capacity.

The president declares that our testing is the best, our healthcare system is the best, our economy will recover the best. And yet any honest review of the facts makes clear that the US's coronavirus response is still one of the worst in the developed world.

The top level of our federal government, gutted of talent, filled with lapdogs, and skeptical of expertise, has botched the national response. Nearly three months into the crisis, we have no national strategy to contain the spread, wildly uneven distribution of PPE, and rates of testing that are multiples lower than what we need — and what we were promised.

We need only look at how other countries have addressed the crisis to face the honest fact that we deserve no trophy. And it's not just a few countries that are leaving us in the dust: Almost every country facing the pandemic has brought its caseloads and death rates down faster than the US because they trusted in experts, planned for catastrophe, and built a centralized infrastructure for tracking and tracing.

This week in Germany, students gave themselves coronavirus tests and went to school. On Tuesday in South Korea, people went to bars (except in Seoul, where the city has temporarily closed restaurants after an outbreak last week). We're not the worst, but we're so far away from being as good as we pretend to be. We still love to talk about American exceptionalism, but in this case American exceptionalism means only that we're exceptionally mediocre.

This would be more tolerable if we had the integrity to be honest about our mediocrity. The president and his allies are essentially shoving their fingers in their ears, and asserting greatness. The president claimed again on Monday, as he did back in March, that everyone can get a test, when we all know everyone can't.

The White House undermines pandemic data, to try to delude people into thinking the pandemic is over. The president's team even distributed one model that, nonsensically, suggested that COVID-19 deaths would drop to zero by this weekend. The governor of Arizona tried to muzzle scientists sharing factual data about the spread of the virus there because he didn't want Arizonans to hear that the peak was still to come.

No one can stop the president from bragging about his pandemic achievements. No one can even stop him and his administration from sharing dishonest data to make their pandemic response seem capable.

But telling ourselves we're doing a great job when we aren't does not actually stop the deaths, the job losses, and the fear, and it doesn't hide from us the images of Germans, Koreans, and New Zealanders safely getting back to school and work.

There is a chance for America to redeem itself. We still have the best scientific researchers in the world, and the pandemic will not end anywhere till we have a treatment or a vaccine. I'd still bet on American scientists to develop these first.

As Winston Churchill (reportedly) said: Americans can always be trusted to do the right thing, once they've tried everything else. Let's hope we soon start doing it. —DP

Once again, Musk rolls the dice.

Lots of entrepreneurs pat themselves on the back for taking big risks — even when they're not actually taking them. (Losing other people's money and having to get a new job if you fail actually isn't that big a risk.) But Elon Musk, one of the most successful and inspiring entrepreneurs in history, does actually take big risks. And, today, he's taking another one.

Musk has reopened Tesla's Fremont California factory, in defiance of the rules of the California county — Alameda — in which the factory is based.

In a tweet, moreover, Musk has said that he himself will be working on the assembly line and suggested that, if local authorities enforce the county's restrictions, he should be the one to be arrested.

Bold.

Even bolder — and the point that Musk's critics are jumping on — is that, if the county's restrictions are sound, Musk may be taking risks with his employees' health.

No matter how frustrated Musk and other Silicon Valley go-getters are about California's tight coronavirus restrictions— and they are very frustrated — the goal of the restrictions is to reduce infections and deaths. So if Musk and Tesla are going to defy these restrictions, they had better be highly confident that they can protect their employees.

In his defense, Musk says he is confident of this. He says Tesla has learned how to protect employees from its manufacturing experience in China. The company has produced a ""Return To Work"" playbook that details the measures the company has put in place.

Alameda County has responded wisely to Musk's gambit. Instead of sending a squad car to the plant to drag Musk off the floor in handcuffs, it has said it will deal with the company with the same ""phased approach"" that it has dealt with other companies that aren't following the rules. If Alameda functions the way other local governments do, one imagines that this ""phased"" approach may take time.

Behind the scenes, Tesla and Alameda have been working on a reopening plan that would have allowed Tesla to restart production early next week. If Alameda is comfortable with the company restarting production in six days, Tesla workers are probably pretty safe today.

Musk's defiant reopening and tweets, however, raise the stakes, and do more than buy him and Tesla a few more production days.

Given the growing national frustration with coronavirus restrictions, they position Musk and Tesla as innovative, bold Davids battling against a bureaucratic Goliath. —HB

Why Ohio's Republican governor is wildly popular, and Georgia's isn't.

Governors are having a good pandemic. While the president's approval rating continues to slump in the 40s, a Washington Post-Ipsos poll finds that

71% of Americans approve of the job their governor is doing on the outbreak, and only 27% disapprove. But there's an interesting disparity between the ratings for two Republican governors, Mike DeWine of Ohio and Brian Kemp of Georgia.

DeWine's handling of the pandemic is most admired in the country, with 86% approval in Ohio. Astonishingly, while 84% of Ohio Republicans approve of how he's doing, even more Democrats — 90% — approve.

Kemp, by contrast, is the only governor with lower approval ratings in his state than the president. Only 39% of Georgians approve of his handling of the crisis, and Democrats overwhelmingly disapprove.

What's the difference between Ohio and Georgia?

DeWine moved early to shut down his state, has pushed hard for testing, and has a government that's clear and transparent about sharing data and advice. There's plenty of partisan rancor in Ohio, but DeWine has strongly supported the experts in his administration.

Kemp has practically been a coronavirus skeptic. He learned that it spreads asymptomatically about a month after everyone else did. He shut down Georgia well after he'd been advised to, and he opened it up way, way before experts wanted to — so early that it even irked the president. That push to reopen has generally hurt his popularity, with 65% of Georgians saying he opened too early.

DeWine's popularity today doesn't mean he'll coast to reelection in 2022, but it's a telling lesson that — at least during a pandemic — caution, clarity, and calm are good politics. —DP

Would a white man get killed for running suspiciously through a neighborhood?

The murder of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man chased down and killed while jogging in a Georgia neighborhood, inspired a white man named Richard Demsick to create a brilliant piece of political theater.

As Insider reports, the 34-year-old Demsick ran shirtless, hat on backward, through a largely white Florida neighborhood ... while carrying a flat-screen TV.

Even though the neighborhood had recently had several robberies, residents smiled and waved at him, and none called the police or tried to stop him. Demsick filmed the run for TikTok, where it now has more than 1 million views.

Does this prove that Arbery's race caused his murder? Of course not. But it's a dark reminder that we see different people differently because of their skin color. —DP

What will flying be like after the pandemic?

Post-pandemic airports will be crammed with temperature sensors, require masks, and have all kinds of new touchless technology, among other changes, according to Thomas Pallini's fascinating Insider interview with the CEO of a company that runs airports.

For a much gloomier take, this essay in the Atlantic says commercial aviation will be terrible (and really expensive) for a long, long time because of fear and low demand. —DP

So, can we finally give up needless business travel forever?

Many of us former road warriors have discovered that we can do our jobs fine using cheap, widely available videoconferencing services like Google Meet and Zoom.

Many of us have also remembered how much time we used to waste in airports, hotels, and planes instead of with our families, colleagues, and friends. So we're wondering whether we can finally take advantage of this crisis to collectively decide that we don't need to do that again.

The entrepreneur Martin Varsavsky, for example, who is now hunkered down with his family in Spain, just tweeted the following: ""I used to travel a third of my work days. So much time wasted on Ubers, security lines, flights, hotels. Please everyone please let's accept video as the new normal!""

So how about it, fellow professionals?

Can we agree to save oodles of time, money, and jet-lag and reserve in-person trips for the few occasions in which in-person is critical?

Or do we have to go back to expensive, exhausting, schlepping as usual? —HB

The Big 3*

A mask factory cancelled a Trump visit because it feared it would spread the virus.

The US president was going to visit the Pennsylvania factory on Friday, but the factory bosses asked him to postpone it, to keep workers safe and the factory humming.

""Why are you saying that to me?""

A Chinese American reporter calls out Trump for singling her out with his anti-China remarks.

A hack for removing the tough white tendons from chicken breasts.

It's all anyone on TikTok is talking about.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the top watchdog for worker safety, has failed to set out clear guidelines for workers.

In the meat industry, OSHA is not enforcing coronavirus-related safety guidelines for many corporations.

Mike Elk is a labor reporter and founder of the crowdfunded labor publication Payday Report.

Across the US, frontline workers are facing down dangerous conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

An outbreak that started at a Smithfield food processing plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, has resulted in more than 1,000 linked cases and is one of the largest identified outbreaks of COVID-19 cases in the nation. An investigation by Buzzfeed showed that the company failed to take steps to head off the outbreak.

And the federal government's chief watchdog for worker safety, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, announced it will not enforce coronavirus safety guidelines if meat processing plants act in ""good faith.""

Outside of meat plants, other workers are fighting unsafe conditions. Nurses in Pittsburgh, Santa Monica, and Michigan went on strike in an effort to obtain personal protective equipment as thousands of frontline healthcare workers are exposed to patients with COVID-19.

Experts say that frontline workers are being exposed needlessly to COVID-19, due to a lack of clear federal standards protecting them.

""There is no leadership because federal OSHA has rolled over and said we are not protecting workers,"" says Debbie Berkowitz, a former OSHA policy adviser during the Obama administration.

Ten years ago, after the outbreak of H1N1, also known as swine flu, the Obama Administration began work on regulations that would have protected workers in the event of a pandemic like COVID-19. However, for more than a decade large corporations blocked these rules from being implemented.

This delay means that workers are now needlessly risking their health in unsafe conditions and risks extending the length of the pandemic as businesses scramble to figure out what to do to confront the crisis.

A stymied attempt to keep workers safe

In 2009, the Obama Administration began rulemaking on a series of bold reforms that would have created workplace safety standards against infectious disease for frontline workers. The rulemaking followed the outbreak of the H1N1 epidemic in 2009 that killed 4,000 Americans.

""There was enormous outreach; we were working incredibly closely with the CDC right away. We were working with unions and the whole AFL-CIO and all the associations that represented nurses and social workers,"" says Berkowitz, who now serves as the Worker Health and Safety Director at the National Employment Labor Project.

""We actually had them in, talking with us, and developing protocols,"" says Berkowitz.

However, for the better part of a decade, the rules went nowhere after Republicans took control of Congress in 2012. Worried about budget cuts if they implemented the rules, the Obama Administration simply sat on them.

Then in 2017, once the Trump administration took office, OSHA ended the rulemaking process and buried the ideas.

So now, in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, workers are left with little protection and employers have few clear guidelines.

Unsafe conditions during a pandemic

Congress has so far yet to pass any workplace safety rule for OSHA to implement for frontline COVID-19 workers, and given the delay in the Obama-era OSHA rules, there is little help for workers.

""If there is no specific standard, then OSHA can do almost nothing to protect workers. OSHA would have to wait till nurses and healthcare workers got sick before they could do anything,"" says Berkowitz. ""There is no ability to really be preventive without a specific standard.""

In an April email obtained by various news outlets, a current OSHA official said that the agency was handcuffed by the lack of rules to act.

""We have received a number of complaints every day for the past several weeks about employers failing to follow the guidance. As an organization, all OSHA can do is contact an employer and send an advisory letter outlining the recommended protective measures,"" wrote the OSHA official.

Additionally, workplace safety advocates say that OSHA isn't working with unions to help create public education campaigns needed to protect workers.

""There is not federal coordination like we have seen after disasters to make that happen,"" says Marianela Acuña-Arreaza of the non-profit National Council for Occupational and Health Safety.

A tough time for a hollowed out agency

The lack of clear rules to protect workers during the pandemic is also compounded by the decade-long erosion of OSHA's ability to even perform the inspections that could catch unsafe conditions.

Under the Trump Administration, the number of OSHA inspectors has dropped to its lowest level in the agency's 48-year history, according to a study by the National Employment Law Project.

Due to years of budget cuts by a GOP-controlled Congress, the number of OSHA inspectors dropped from nearly 1,000 in 2010 to 815 in 2016. Now, through attrition and a federal hiring freeze imposed by the Trump administration, only 752 inspectors are employed.

The problem of understaffing isn't new to OSHA; the agency has perennially been underfunded. Therefore, OSHA has developed targeted rules that allow it to focus on specific problems. Without an infectious disease standard in place, OSHA is extremely limited in its legal ability to be a watchdog for workers.

Under President Obama, OSHA, with its limited staffing, has also relied heavily on their collaborations with unions to help them target employers and educate workers about hazards. This time around, OSHA hasn't invited in worker advocates to coordinate strategies to combat COVID-19.

""The coordination is extremely lacking right now. We haven't seen any type of support on how to get workers trained on how to take care of themselves,"" says Acuña-Arreaza.

However, despite the lack of coordination, workers' rights advocates like Acuña-Arreaza are working to educate workers about their rights. She says that turnout for their workplace and safety training are at record numbers.

Frustrated by a lack of federal attention, workers have gone out on strike at over 115 employers across the US, according to a strike-tracking map built by my publication, Payday Report.

Advocates say that it's time for workers to press to include the OSHA standard as part of the next congressional coronavirus aid package, enacting reforms for workers for years to come.

""This is a crisis, but it could also be a moment where workers build power,"" says Acuña-Arreaza.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

April was the worst month for job losses in the history of the US.

More Americans lost their jobs last month than during the entire financial crisis from 2007 to 2009 — or during any downturn in the past 80 years.

Andy Kiersz / Business Insider

Our official unemployment rate is now 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression. Moreover, as Insider's Carmen Reinicke explains, this rate counts only people who are actively looking for work and not finding it, so it most likely is a significant undercount, as it excludes the Americans who want to be working but aren't even looking.

Andy Kiersz / Business Insider

The ""employment to population"" ratio also dropped to a record low. Only about half of Americans — 51% — are employed right now. The peak of this measure was about 64% in 2000.

7.7 million restaurant, bar, and hotel workers lost their jobs.

2.5 million health-services and education workers lost their jobs.

2.1 million retail and store workers lost their jobs.

And so on.

The only bright spot is that about 18 million of the 20.5 million job losses are considered temporary. At least for now, these folks think they'll be rehired when the economy improves.

This devastating jobs report raises a reasonable question that has come up often in the past few weeks:

Why, in the face of this economic and social calamity, is the stock market going up?

Back in February and early March, as the pandemic ravaged one industry after another, the stock market plunged by a third in five weeks.

Since then, the news has seemed to have only gotten worse.

And yet, since bottoming in mid-March, the stock market has risen steadily. Now, six weeks later, it has recovered about two-thirds of its losses and is not far below its all-time high.

So what gives?

Well, first, stock prices generally reflect investors' assessments about the future, not the past. As horrific as the economic news has been over the past six weeks, it has actually been better than some investors expected it might be back in mid-March.

Some economists, moreover, believe that we've already experienced the worst of the impact of the pandemic and that the economy will improve from here.

Second, the government's fast, aggressive financial response to the crisis — in the form of emergency aid packages from the Treasury and Congress and emergency liquidity from the Federal Reserve — has significantly limited the potential economic damage.

The government aid packages haven't saved all jobs (by a long shot), and they won't save all US businesses, but they've helped save a lot.

In fact, one of Wall Street's best economists, Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs, estimates that the various forms of government aid — including enhanced unemployment benefits — will actually more than offset the income Americans have collectively lost this year. This aid will not be shared equally, so there will still be plenty of individual pain, but, in aggregate, a lot of the economy's consumer spending should be maintained.

Goldman Sachs

Last of all, the market has done well because many of the most valuable companies in the index have been shielded or actually even benefitted from the crisis.

The Charles Schwab strategist Liz Ann Sonders notes that more than half of the value of the S&P 500 comes from companies in the tech, healthcare, and communications-services industries. These companies have done fine or even well in the past few months.

The so-called FANG+ companies, moreover — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Microsoft, and other internet giants — make up a bigger percentage of the market than ever before. And they have collectively risen.

So, in short, for now, the reason the stock market is rising is that some investors believe we've seen the worst of the impact and that the situation will improve from here.

Other investors, meanwhile, think there's more bad news to come and those hoping for a quick recovery will be disappointed. The most famous investor on the planet, Warren Buffett, appears to be in this camp.

Which investors are right?

We'll see. No one has a crystal ball, and the endless challenge of trying to make better predictions than other investors is one reason the stock market is so fascinating.

In the meantime, our sympathies to the tens of millions of Americans who have lost their jobs in this crisis. We all hope that the optimists are right, that the worst is over, and that we can rebuild our economy quickly from here.

The government is likely undercounting the number of coronavirus cases and deaths, and some leaders have not provided enough support to hospitals in need.

As a matter of foreign policy, the United States should strengthen its ties to the Iranian people, while opposing the regime.

As the coronavirus spreads throughout Iran, a quiet revolution is simmering, unnoticed in the US media.

The Iranian regime's mishandling of COVID-19 – downplaying it while the government hoarded tests, doing nothing to alleviate the dire medical and economic situation – is the final straw after the massacre of 1,500 protesters in November 2019, and the January shooting of a civilian plane killing 176 people and subsequent cover up. The recent friendly fire mishap in the Gulf of Oman, killing nineteen Iranian sailors, only aggravates the already bad situation.

The regime has united Iranians across social and economic lines in their opposition. In November 2019, the protesters shot in the streets mostly came from the marginalized communities of the urban poor, often forced by water shortages to leave their rural livelihoods.

In January 2020, the streets were filled with enraged Iranians from the middle and upper classes, whose family members and friends were killed when an Iranian Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) shot down a passenger jet. Now COVID-19 is afflicting Iranians of all classes across the country, and regime leaders are missing in action, except for persistently lying about the number of dead.

The epic mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic has set the stage for more anger among the Iranian public.

A mishandled pandemic

Twin political and religious decisions contributed to the early spread of the coronavirus.

First, despite their knowledge of the COVID-19 outbreak, the regime made a cynical political move by insisting on holding Parliamentary elections and the public celebrations for the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution before making any public announcements about social distancing. These decisions to hold public events came despite the fact Hassan Ghazizadeh Hashemi, the former Minister of Health, said he warned President Rouhani about the pandemic in December.

After the government's duplicity was known, public outrage exploded on social media, and the current Minister of Health Saeid Namaki revealed that his own objections to this policy had been suppressed. Days before the election Namaki was told that ""It's not right to talk about the coronavirus outbreak before the elections.""

Second, some religious leaders ignored health warnings and kept mosques and other sites open. In the religious city of Qom the decision was made, after cases had been detected, to keep the Fatimah Masumeh shrine open. Mohammad Saeedi, the Supreme Leader's representative in Qom, accused President Trump and the US of trying to shut the city down.

""No one allows the enemy to portray Qom as an unsafe city; defeating Qom is the dream of treacherous Trump and his domestic mercenaries, but this dream will not be realized even in their grave,"" Saeedi said. After all, he reasoned, sick people should come to the shrine, a place of healing.

That argument is hard to beat for black humor, but Iran's famous wit has been working overtime in the age of coronavirus. No one is sacred or spared, least of all clerics. When a cleric maintained that applying ""violet leaf oil"" to the anus could cure coronavirus, Iranians made hundreds of jokes, sharing them on social media.

Mehdi Sabili, the director of an institute that promotes Islamic medicine recommended drinking camel's urine, modelling this behavior in a video that went viral, provoking satire and jokes. This evidently embarrassed the regime. After arresting and interrogating Sabili, the police discredited the ""charlatan"", saying that he had no expertise in any kind of medicine – Islamic or otherwise.

As respect for and confidence in the regime diminish, undermined by its ineptitude and mismanagement, acts of resistance increase. Women have been seen flouting the strict dress code. As a sign of national unity Iranians are singing ""Ey Iran"", an anthem beloved by the Iranian people, and disliked by the regime.

Iranians have been taking steps within their own communities to fill the gap left by their leaders, ensuring that hospitals have adequate supplies and hospital workers are fed. There have been reports of philanthropists, artists, and NGOs providing hospitals and medical staff with masks, gowns, and food. On their own, some factories have converted to producing medical supplies.

Pushback from within the government

The trifecta of misdeeds — mishandling the protests, shooting down the plane, and misleading the public about the virus — by the Iranian regime over the past six months has provoked criticism from members and supporters of the government as well as its opponents.

A report from the country's Parliament released in mid-April estimated Iran's COVID-19 deaths were double the official numbers and cases were many times higher than the official counts at the time.

The numbers in the report would have earned Iran the dubious honor of having the highest number of infections per capita. Even more astonishing than the coronavirus numbers in the report was the fact that the Iranian Parliament directly contradicted the Rouhani administration.



Parliamentarian Bahram Parsaei revealed that the Minister of Interior ignored his advice to postpone the Parliamentary elections. Similarly, the Iranian Health Minister said he had called for a halt to flights to and from China in January. Even though China air travel was officially banned January 31, Mahan Air flights to Beijing continued well into February.

What the US should do now

Where all this will lead is uncertain. Iranians are united more by their disgust with the regime than by a singular vision for the future.

But the trust between the Iranian regime and its citizens has been irrevocably shattered.

This vulnerability of Iran's leaders offers an opportunity for the US to expand its policy to include strengthening connections with the Iranian people, while still opposing the regime.

If sanctions are lifted, the US should ensure that direct medical and financial aid are not diverted by the regime. If they remain in place, the US could still support nongovernmental aid groups that are approved by the Treasury Department's economic sanctions division which give directly to the Iranian people.

The US rightly opposes the five billion dollar ""coronavirus loan"" Iran has requested from the IMF, which likely would be diverted to terrorist groups and foreign proxies. Is it a coincidence that at the same time nearly five billion dollars have ""gone missing"" from Iran's state coffers?

Finally, the US should defend Iranians' human rights, which include the right to clean water and proper sanitation – essential in a country suffering from bad water management – as well as the right to criticize their leaders. Specifically, US leaders (from Congress as well as the White House) could speak out about persecution of minorities, including religious ones, and the abuse and torture of political prisoners.

Now is the perfect time to match opposition to the Iranian regime with support for its people.

White House workers are terrified to go to work (with testing), but they still expect you to go (without testing)

CEA Chair Kevin Hassett Alex Wong/Getty Images

On Sunday, CBS News interviewed a struggling American about doing his job during the pandemic: ""It's scary to go to work,"" he said.

That struggling worker is Kevin Hassett, one of President Trump's top economic advisers. And that workplace is the White House.

A presidential valet has tested positive for COVID-19. So has the personal assistant to Ivanka Trump. So has Katie Miller, the press secretary to VP Mike Pence and wife of presidential advisor Stephen Miller. Three of the most important scientists coordinating the administration's pandemic response — Anthony Fauci, CDC head Robert Redfield, and FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn — all just started self-isolating because of contact with people who tested positive.

The White House outbreak demonstrates the muddle of the administration's ""Reopen, Reopen, Reopen"" message. At every turn, President Trump and VP Pence exhort us to get back to work and shopping. The White House downplays the severity of the pandemic and fiddles with data to minimize death tolls. The president blithely says the disease will go away without a vaccine and orders meatpackers back to work even as the disease rages through their plants.

But the dissonance between what the White House is telling the rest of us to do and what it's doing for itself is shocking. The White House is urging us to get back to work, and not worry about the shortage of tests or the absence of a testing strategy. Meanwhile, Kevin Hassett is still scared even though the White House gets to test everyone who comes in, and test staff daily.

Why does the president expect the rest of us to happily get back to work without tests, when the White House itself —one of the most tested and tracked place on the planet — is a COVID-19 hot spot filled with people who are scared to come to work? — DP

It's not ""government lockdowns"" that are hurting our economy — it's the coronavirus

One unfortunate consequence of our hyper-politicized environment is that it occasionally blinds us to the truth.

Republicans are howling that ""government lockdowns"" favored by Democrats are killing our economy.

Democrats, meanwhile, are screaming that the Republicans' obsession with ""reopening the economy"" is going to get tens of thousands of Americans killed.

Both of these stories miss the point.

What's hurting our economy is not government regulations. It's the common-sense desire of many of us to reduce the risk that we will get or spread the coronavirus.

Responsible, informed Americans understand that it's risky to gather in big groups indoors in places like offices, restaurants, churches, planes, and arenas. Responsible, informed Americans, therefore, are avoiding gathering in these places — and, where possible, avoiding asking their employees, congregants, and customers to gather in them.

Responsible, informed Americans started doing this before the government asked or required them to.

And responsible, informed Americans will keep doing it after the government lifts restrictions, until they are persuaded that gathering indoors in groups is actually, once again, low risk.

Don't believe it?

Let's go to the charts.

The location-data company SafeGraph tracks and charts mobility data. SafeGraph's data shows that most people stopped shopping, traveling, eating and drinking out, and attending sporting events weeks before the government required them to.

In and around Atlanta, for example, movement plunged around the middle of March. Georgia's governor didn't lock down the state until April 2.

SafeGraph

Same story in Miami. Most people stopped going out around March 15. The state didn't lock down until April 1.

SafeGraph

In fact, the plunge in activity occurred around the same time for every major area that SafeGuard tracks, regardless of what the local government's requirements were.

SafeGraph

As the above chart also shows, in recent weeks, activity has been increasing again.

Here, too, however, it's not government ""reopenings"" that are leading to more activity. It's the confidence among citizens that it's less risky to go out.

This is visible in a chart of the New York area. New York's lockdown is still in place. And yet, as the infection and death counts drop, New Yorkers are slowly increasing their activity again.

SafeGraph

The Georgia chart above shows a similar pattern. The state began reopening at the end of April. Activity is increasing — and increasing modestly faster than it is in New York — but it is nowhere close to normal.

The message of these charts and other measures of regional activity and commerce is clear: Lockdowns are having a modest impact, but the main force that is depressing our economy is the desire of citizens and business owners not to catch or spread the coronavirus.

As one recent study put it:

""...the labor market slowdown was due primarily to a nationwide response to evolving epidemiological conditions... individual state policies and own epidemiologic situations have had a comparatively modest effect.""

To fix our economy, therefore, we should ignore the divisive battle cries of our two political teams and focus on what is actually causing the problem: the coronavirus. — HB

Pay attention to tomorrow's monumental Supreme Court case about Trump's tax records.

While we're preoccupied by the pandemic, the Supreme Court is tackling monumental cases that could radically reshape American government and weaken the separation of powers.

Last week, SCOTUS threw out the Bridgegate convictions, freeing governors and the president to ruthlessly punish enemies.

And on Tuesday the justices will hear arguments in a pair of cases that could effectively put the president above the law. The linked cases concern the records of Trump's bankers and accountants, which have been subpoenaed by both Congress and a New York state prosecutor pursuing a criminal case.

The president, who has never turned over his tax returns and has blocked every investigation of his convoluted finances, claims he doesn't have to supply the records to Congress because they have no legitimate legislative reason to ask for them — even though historically courts have ruled that Congress, an equal branch of government, has vast, essentially untrammeled power to gather documents in the course of its work.

The president also claims he doesn't have to comply with the New York prosecutor because the president can't even be investigated for a crime while in office. In a preliminary argument in this case, the president's lawyer said Trump could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not be investigated.

I'll bet you that this Supreme Court effectively rules in the president's favor in both cases, most likely by giving him an indirect win that delays any handover of documents until after the election, when it won't matter anyway.

If the President succeeds again in blocking inquiries, he will have prevented the public from learning anything about his finances and the potential corruption in them. He has also blocked any testimony by White House officials before Congress on any subject he cares about, shielding the federal government from any oversight and investigation.

And if Trump wins Tuesday, he may get the Supreme Court to validate a theory of power that makes the US President above criminal law, beyond investigation by Congress, and untouchable by the courts.

That's terrifying. — DP

Musk threatens to leave California because of its ""fascist"" coronavirus restrictions

FILE PHOTO: Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk speaks at an opening ceremony for Tesla China-made Model Y program in Shanghai Reuters Tesla founder Elon Musk has been vocal about his opposition to governmental coronavirus restrictions, and most of his ire has been directed at Tesla's home state of California.

This weekend, as Insider's Graham Rapier reports, Musk let fly again, vowing to sue the county of Alameda and ""immediately leave"" California because of its refusal to let Tesla reopen its Fremont car factory. Today, he followed through on the first part of the threat and filed the lawsuit.

Meanwhile, a California assemblywoman tweeted her view of Musk's threat: ""F*ck Elon Musk.""

This fistfight reveals one of many structural weaknesses the US has in its fight against the coronavirus: Our federalist system allows states to compete to woo citizens and employers by offering different rules and tax incentives, but our open borders allow everyone to travel everywhere.

As Musk suggests, the restrictions in Nevada are far less onerous than those in California, so if Tesla's Fremont factory were located there, it could already be up and running.

Meanwhile, Californians who share the assemblywoman's view can rightly point out that, if Nevada's lax restrictions facilitate the spread of the coronavirus, freely traveling Nevadans might soon infect more cautious Californians again. — HB

Will the pandemic lead to companies renting less office space… or more?

The prevailing wisdom is that the pandemic will lead to a permanent kneecapping of the commercial office real-estate business as companies realize that many employees can and will want to work from home and downsize their office space.

As Insider's Charlie Wood reports, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt offers a different view. Schmidt predicts that the pandemic will lead companies to rent more office space as they retool their offices to support social distancing and, in so doing, lease more office space per person.

Which view do you think is right? Please reply to this email and let us know.

While you're thinking, we'll offer a third possibility: These two opposing forces will net out to have a minimal impact on the demand for office space. More employees will work at home, requiring less commercial office space, but employees who do work in the office will require more space per person. — HB

A couple of weekends ago, a video of people defying France's coronavirus lockdown and dancing together in the streets of Paris set French Twitter alight. Police arrived and dispersed them peacefully, letting the balcony ""DJ"" off with a warning. But many suggested law enforcement would have reacted differently if the gathering of people, in the gentrified neighborhood of Montmartre, had not been middle class and white.

The incident was particularly inflammatory because it followed several nights of violence in lower-income neighborhoods just a few miles north, where police fired tear gas and rubber bullets towards groups of young people who torched cars and lit dumpster fires. The clashes began after an incident between police and a motorcyclist that landed the latter in hospital, but they were rooted in broader grievances about France's strict eight-week lockdown and its outsize impact on people in the banlieues, or working-class suburbs.

Across Europe, shutdowns have wreaked economic chaos—France just suffered its worst economic contraction since World War II, while the UK is on track for its deepest recession in 300 years. The poor will of course be hardest hit. Already, long lines of people snake through France's low-income neighborhoods towards food distribution sites. But as dire as it is, those people will likely end up better off than their American counterparts. They have universal healthcare and state-subsidized furlough pay. And because most have not been permanently laid off, they'll be back to work when businesses reopen on Monday.

Inequality is rife

Several weeks into confinement here in France, the public health chief announced that Seine-Saint-Denis — one of the poorest, and densest, departments in France — had seen a spike in deaths compared to other areas around Paris. The far-right politician Marine Le Pen accused the government of not adequately enforcing lockdown measures there, while French media snapped photos of crowded sidewalks and described the department's residents as ""undisciplined"" for not respecting the rules. But the banlieues supply many of Paris' essential employees, such as cashiers, cleaners, and garbage-truck drivers. The people seen out and about in Seine-Saint-Denis were likely just going to work.

Not that those commutes are easy. Public transportation has been significantly reduced, and one grocery store employee from Cergy-Pontoise, another suburb, told me the train he takes to work has only been running once every two hours. He said that's also why more people can be seen on the streets in his neighborhood — they don't have many shops to begin with, and have to walk further to access them.

Meanwhile, the wealthy central arrondissements of Paris are quiet. According to data from the French telecom Orange, more than a million Parisians fled the city when the lockdown was announced. Those that left managed to avoid, among other things, the daytime exercise ban — a Paris-only rule prohibiting outdoor physical activity between 10 am and 7 pm. And while some lucky city-dwellers might have backyards or rooftops, most have now gone eight weeks without access to green space because parks have been closed since March 16.

According to Dr. Jennifer Heisz, an expert in brain health and associate professor in kinesiology at McMaster University, not being able to exercise can have serious physical and mental health consequences. Working out makes us more resilient to everyday stressors, as well as preventing stress-induced inflammation, which can lead to anxiety and depression.

But physical activity — and outings in general — have been restricted across Europe. The Italian region of Lombardy banned outdoor exercise altogether in mid-March. Spain did the same, and, for six weeks, also banned children from leaving their homes. Here in France, we are only allowed out once a day, for a maximum of one hour, and can only travel 1 kilometers (0.6 miles) from home. Calls to domestic abuse hotlines have skyrocketed.

Breaking these lockdown rules can get you in hot water. We have to carry ID and documentation to justify being outside in case paramilitary gendarmes stop and question us. As of late April, French police had carried out 15.5 million stops and administered 915,000 fines. But the decision to fine is extremely subjective. For example if you go out for groceries — one of a handful of acceptable reasons for leaving the house — it is up to the officer to decide whether your chosen store is within a ""reasonable"" distance from your home or whether you have abused your privileges.

The fines themselves are indicators of socioeconomic status too. Many of my friends initially shrugged off the idea of getting one (€135 for your first infraction); if they really needed to break the rules, they'd just risk getting caught and paying it. But over the weeks, the law has been tightened. Now, a second infraction can cost as much as €1,500 and a fourth can cost €3,700 — and land you in prison for six months. Again, this matters if certain people are disproportionately targeted.

It's going to be worse in the US

While the inequalities in Europe have been severe, the situation is likely to be even worse in the US.

Here, the shutdowns have at least succeeded in their objectives of flattening the COVID-19 curve. Cases in Italy, Spain, and France peaked in early April and have fallen ever since. By contrast, new cases in the US have plateaued at a still-high level. And despite some state governors pushing to lift restrictions, virus cases are on the rise outside of New York City.

Another major difference is that French medical care is government-funded, rather than provided by employers. The ease with which any tax-paying resident can walk into a medical clinic and be seen by a doctor may have helped boost early detection. And, importantly, those that may have lost their jobs due to the pandemic can still access care, unlike American workers, who, if laid off, will suddenly find their healthcare gone as well.

Relief is in sight on the economic front, here, too. In France, as in other European countries like Germany, layoffs have largely been avoided. Instead, the government directly supported businesses so that they could keep staff on payroll — essentially paying companies to put employees on temporary paid leave instead of letting them go. That means those companies are still fully staffed up and ready to reopen next week. It also means their workers have continued to be paid 84% of their regular salaries.

Meanwhile, the US reported on Friday that more than 20 million people lost their jobs in April and many businesses are disappearing altogether. Government support has been meager, with limited funds to small businesses and a one-time check of up to $1,200 per person.

Some people have, no doubt, slipped through the cracks here in Europe, especially in the informal sector. But things could have gotten a lot uglier. Now, thanks to solid healthcare and temporary unemployment benefits, the worst appears to be over. The same cannot be said for the US.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

Our nation has a terrible disease. It goes beyond the coronavirus pandemic that has taken a human, social, and economic toll. It's in the roots of our politics.

We are so divided that not even in the midst of a world-shaking pandemic can we bridge the gap. As the country debates reopening, the lack of unity among politicians and the public portends a dangerous roadmap for future threats.

The opportunity of crisis

COVID-19 has shown a weakness in the American societal infrastructure. There were warnings about the coming health crisis, but our lack of preparedness left us exposed.

There is opportunity to learn from this pandemic, and to imagine what else is on our horizon and how to preempt it.

Bill Gates has repeatedly warned of the dangers of a natural or even man-made pandemic similar to the coronavirus. With its intentionality, bioterror could make today's pandemic look quaint.

We're at varying stages of aggression with North Korea, China, and Iran, and it's not hard to contemplate an escalation that puts our country on wartime footing.

The climate crisis demands bold measures to combat an enormous impact on our daily lives, including clean water shortages, extreme weather events, and rising sea levels.

But there are two issues preventing us from effectively managing these potential threats: as of now Americans do not have the collective will and resources to prepare for the next unimaginable, and our political leaders appear to be incapable of responding in a unified way that puts country first. If the coronavirus has taught us anything, we are too divided to stop or even battle the inevitable.

Clarity in unity

Based on each state's response to the coronavirus, there's been much speculation in traditional and social media as to whether GOP- or Democrat-dominated states will be hit harder by the disease. In a more perfect union, there should be no concern about the partisan lean of those hit by the disease, but in 2020 America, there's a political side to every subject.

One light in an otherwise dark moment in government is the bipartisan relief legislation passed by Congress. But fiscal hawks — those who want to pare down our economic response for fear of the national debt — are starting to gain traction amid the one sign of comity.

A marker of our partisanship is that neither side is sufficiently comfortable criticizing its own and complimenting the other team.

Several personalities on Fox News are essentially Trump TV, which makes it the echo chamber of Red America. MSNBC and CNN, which report through a blue lens, still have the integrity to criticize their own, but the lens still screens out clarity. Across the landscape, the focus is as much on scoring political points as it is on the potential to save lives.

We've seen a few encouraging moves – for example, Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham and Rep. Doug Collins criticized Governor Brian Kemp for reopening too fast. Members of both parties spoke out on some of Trump's most extreme actions – like claiming total authority over the coronavirus response or making dangerous claims about ingesting disinfectants. Some Democrats and Republicans are even praising colleagues across the aisle.

The ability to criticize one's own or find uncommon accord is refreshing, but it shouldn't be. With existential threats upon us, it is the core of our autonomy. It is the path for representatives of our democracy to bring us through crisis.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

By turning this anti-China conspiracy theory into a talking point on Trump's favorite TV shows and in his political circles, though, hawks could win Trump to their side. It's worked before.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

In recent weeks Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been making the rounds on the conservative media circuit, spreading the conspiracy theory that the coronavirus may have escaped from a Chinese government laboratory in Wuhan. He's started getting in fights with mainstream media about it too.

The scientific consensus is that the virus was not man made, and US intelligence agencies have said that there's no evidence that the virus escaped from a lab instead of occurring naturally and spreading to an open market in Wuhan.

Still, Pompeo insists he has evidence to support his theory, though he hasn't provided any. High ranking members of the GOP, like Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, have spread the idea on conservative media outlets as well.

Maybe they believe this stuff. And maybe they have evidence they plan on showing the American people eventually. But given how blatantly Pompeo dodges the evidence question when it's raised in mainstream media, it's more likely they're just performing for an audience of one — President Donald Trump.

By turning this theory about the virus' creation into a Fox News talking point, Republicans who want the president to be more aggressive towards China can feed it to Trump through his favorite filter. That, in turn, could harden his stance on China.

Trump has a history of going softer on China than the hawkish in his administration and in his party would like, and on issues that really matter. Instead of listening to the hawks, he takes a softer stance often recommended by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and other more business-focused officials working on the US trade deal with China, Trump's obsession.

For example, Congress unanimously passed bills in December condemning China for its treatment of Uighur Muslims and for its anti-democratic encroachment on civil liberties in Hong Kong. For any normal White House this would be an obvious moment to stand up for human rights, but Trump didn't voice support for either cause.

And in between complaining about the unfairness that prompted him to start a trade war with China, Trump has always professed to like and respect Chinese President Xi Jinping. He's maintained that in press conferences throughout this pandemic.

For a time Trump insisted on calling the coronavirus the ""Wuhan virus,"" in an attempt to retaliate when a Chinese diplomat started spreading the conspiracy theory that it came from the US. But after a meeting of G20 world leaders at the end of March he pulled back from that.

Trump came out of that G20 meeting talking about how many ventilators the US would soon sell to other countries — as if COVID-19 were a businesses opportunity, a deal. It's clear that he would like to get back to that as soon as possible. That's why he's trying to declare victory over the virus and open up the economy again. He wants to get back to what his presidency used to be, and that includes spending his time haggling over soybeans with China.

That return to normalcy is just not ideal for Washington's China hawks — not with anger at China increasing around the world. Countries like the UK and Australia are calling for an inquiry into the origins of the virus. And if Trump is more focused on getting a trade deal from China, he may not be as supportive.

The idea that China unleashed the virus on the world and refuses to take responsibility for it, though, may be enough to sustain Trump's anger so that he continues to listen to hawks like Pompeo, sidelining pragmatists like Mnuchin.

Trump's habit of regurgitating ideas he's heard in conservative media circles is well documented. Most recently, Axios reports that Trump has taken to questioning the official COVID-19 death toll. It's a theory that got conservative talking heads Diamond and Silk kicked off of Fox News, but it's been floating around the right wing since death tolls started rising in the US at the end of March.

So filtering an idea that could harden Trump's stance on China through his favorite TV shows could work. In fact, it could be working right now.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

With the stock market rallying sharply off its March 23 low, the usual cries have started: stocks are missing the economic reality, they're whistling by the graveyard, they're completely divorced from economic fundamentals.

In the last week: the Economist claims ""A dangerous gap has opened between America's stock market and the real economy."" Noted economic pundit Mohamed El-Erian argued that the ""Market keeps distancing itself from the economy."" But that is not so surprising early on.

Admittedly, current economic conditions are poor. Economic output has cratered, leaving widespread joblessness in its wake.

But this does not necessarily mean equity prices should be substantially lower than they are now. The US equity market is not about whether economic conditions are good or bad. Rather, what matters is whether conditions are improving or getting worse.

Today, the evidence is mounting that economic conditions, while far from good, are starting to improve. This is why stocks are up.

Hitting the bottom

Generally speaking, economic conditions can be thought of in two ways: momentum and level of activity. The momentum in the economy represents how quickly conditions are changing in relation to the past while level of activity in the economy measures how far conditions are from their historical averages.

For instance, the US can add thousands of jobs — that shows positive momentum — while the unemployment rate — the level — remains well above its historically average. Momentum needs to be positive in order for the level of activity to improve.

Consider the period following the 2009 recession. It took many years for the level of economic activity to return to potential, as the chart below demonstrates. Even as potential growth repeatedly got revised down, the level of growth hit potential sometime in 2017. Still, this period was an especially good one for stock prices even if for many, it ""didn't feel like"" a recovery.

Today, the evidence is mounting that the level of activity has bottomed – that is, conditions are not getting any worse – and the momentum in the economy has picked up somewhat.

Motor gasoline demand bottomed for the week ending April 10 and has been climbing, retracing about one-third of its decline since mid-March.

Mortgage purchase applications also bottomed for the week ending April 10, similarly recouping about 40 percent of its plunge since mid-March.

Passenger screenings at our nation's airports are also on the mend. The count is now about double the April 14 low, but still 93% off its year-ago level.

Notice that the timing of this improvement precedes the formal lifting of shelter-in-place orders for nearly all states. Thus, it stands to reason that there is room for at least some improvement once formal lockdowns end.

Of course, there are risks to the outlook. Double-dips in the economy are usually about policy choices. Almost always, double-dips are about policy choices after a recovery starts.

For example, in 1982, the economy saw a deep recession after a brief recovery because the Federal Reserve tightened interest rates to take on inflation. In the case of the coronavirus pandemic, the policy choice would be to shut parts of the economy down if the virus spread gets worse.

That said, markets have rallied for good reason and the message from stocks is not all that different from what I see in the economy. Economic conditions are no longer getting worse and the re-opening is likely to be measured. Still, we see modest improvement across a range of metrics.

Does that mean things in the economy are good? Of course not. But stocks tend to get better before the economy is ""good.""",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

The first quarter results tell the story of an economy under fire. Indeed, American businesses are struggling with an important decision: do we crack the window and reopen our economy? Or, continue to err on the side of caution?

States like Tennessee are leading the way by easing restrictions on local commerce, but business owners remain mired in a fog of what ifs: what if my customers are too scared to leave their homes? What if my employees are too scared to come back to work? What if this financial hole is too deep for me to escape?

Compounding these fears is the knowledge that the existing regulatory state, by its very nature, acts as a barrier to recovery and innovation. For businesses that survive the pandemic, efforts to restart operations will be met with layers of red tape, tax liability, paperwork, and the threat of opportunistic litigation.

When I ask what federal regulations make their jobs harder, with little benefit to be had, business owners can almost always provide a list. Fortunately, the American economy does not exist at the mercy of statutes, even as it functions in spite of them. Congress can and must act now to eliminate unnecessary and burdensome regulatory schemes.

Since March 5, the Senate has passed four ""rescue"" packages of legislation to alleviate the effects of the healthcare and economic crisis caused by COVID-19. However, those packages were missing permanent statutory reform that owners of businesses large and small would welcome.

Moving forward, we should focus on getting government out of the way, and unburdening business owners, reducing the potential for waste, fraud, and abuse, and promoting private investment and competition. This progress, coupled with sensible liability protections, will allow business owners, hospitals, doctors, and nurses to confidently continue serving their communities, without fear of costly lawsuits.

Shoring up America's economy will also require incentivizing business back to our shores. As we create the environment necessary for manufacturing to return to the United States, we must acknowledge that overregulation is one of the reasons it left.

American workers are facing unprecedented levels of unemployment, but if we invest now in education and training programs, we can recoup outsourced manufacturing and jobs. The bipartisan Advanced Manufacturing Jobs in America Act will jumpstart partnerships between colleges and advanced manufacturers to prepare a new, US-based workforce to take over these roles.

We must also look to specific industries to lead the way, under the guidance of targeted legislation. The global pandemic has highlighted vulnerabilities in our pharmaceutical supply chain, caused by our dependence on foreign manufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredients. My bipartisan Securing America's Medicine Cabinet, or, ""SAM-C,"" Act will expand upon existing programs within the Food and Drug Administration to prioritize issues related to national security and critical drug shortages.

SAM-C authorizes $100 million to develop centers of excellence where universities and the private sector will work together to develop new drug manufacturing technology and processes, and train a new workforce. Proposed tax credits for manufacturers who close foreign-based facilities and open or expand domestic ones will sweeten the deal.

The American people are stronger than this pandemic, and they want their leaders to translate that strength into action.

We know the formula for a successful, productive economy. It's time Congress recognized what American businesses are telling us: if we are able to function safely and efficiently under waived regulations during the COVID-19 crisis, we can do so once quarantine is finally lifted.

This Friday, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics will be releasing its Employment Situation Report — more commonly known as the jobs report — for the month of April 2020.

The jobs report will allow us all to see the broader impact of the unprecedented employment depression resulting from the coronavirus crisis. The size of the job loss is certain to be devastating, but some numbers may not look so bad.: Average hourly wages, hours worked and average weekly incomes will likely jump more on a month-over-month basis than ever before in the history of the data.

Moreover, when the May jobs report is released on June 5, we will likely see March through May large increases in each of these measures for the production and nonsupervisory workers who are still employed. Average hourly earnings could increase 4% to 6% over this time period; hours worked could increase 6% to 8% ; and weekly incomes could jump as much as 10% to 15% .

This will not be because workers remaining on the job have gotten raises, are working longer hours, or are taking home more money overall. It will be due to the near elimination of tens of millions of low-wage, low-hour jobs over the course of the US global economic lockdown.

We saw a smattering of this phenomenon last month with the release of the BLS report for March. Average hourly wages for production and nonsupervisory workers jumped by 10 cents, or 0.42% in one month from February to March. In the same period, the US lost 713,000 private sector jobs. This was just the tip of the iceberg, as initial jobless claims showed layoffs and furloughs through April 25 totaled 30.3 million since the crisis began.

We are experiencing the fastest moving and largest loss of jobs in the history of employment data record keeping. The monthly BLS Employment Situation Report uses data collected each month for the payroll period in which the twelfth of the month occurs. Therefore, the March report was for the payroll week ended March 13, and the report that will be issued this coming Friday will contain data collected for the week ended April 17.

So by construction, the numbers released on jobs day will continue to lag the rapidly changing facts on the ground. We are unlikely to get a full picture of the depth and breadth of the crisis until June.

By mid-May, it is likely that we will see continuing unemployment claims begin to peak, as the nation slowly reopens the economy (which data we will not see from the Department of Labor until May 28). And, as I wrote (way back, it seems) on March 14, the mounting layoffs and furloughs have unsurprisingly disproportionately hit front-line, customer-facing production and non-supervisory jobs – most of which are low-wage, low hour positions.

Assuming that continuing claims (which were just under 18 million for the week ending April 18, the latest data available) peak at between 30 and 35 million – which seems likely – at some point we will know the actual mix of job losses as between low-paying and higher paying jobs.

But what is clear today is that the US economy has been massively dependent on increasing numbers of low quality jobs to employ its workers. And the current crisis is about to prove conclusively what the Job Quality Index (JQI), developed by my colleagues and myself in 2019, has shown about the anemic average wage growth of recent years. More specifically, that increases in overall employment were substantially offset by a surge in low-wage, low-hour jobs as a percentage of the mix.

And now we will see what happens when you wipe out over 20 million of those low quality jobs: average wages and weekly incomes will jump in an economy otherwise devastated beyond all belief.

To estimate the impact on averages wages, hours worked and weekly incomes of production and non-supervisory jobs (until recently, 83% of the jobs out there) I opened up the JQI model and attributed loss factors, at peak, to the most severely impacted job categories chosen carefully to exclude things like grocery store and pharmacy jobs, which we know are still seeking workers.

It would be fair to argue that there are other sectors impacted by layoffs and furloughs – there most certainly are. And one can certainly debate the level of peak losses I estimated in the chart presented here. This is just one cut at very complex data.

The upshot is that the forgoing methodology forecasts peak losses of some 27.6 million of production and non-supervisory jobs. This would be more or less consistent with overall continuing unemployment claims of about 33 million to 35 million at peak (some of which will be managerial and supervisory jobs and some self-employed workers newly qualifying for unemployment insurance under emergency programs).

The high end of the likely ranges for changes to average hourly wages, hours worked and weekly incomes, presented in the opening paragraphs of this piece, are indicative of the foregoing modeling. The lower end of the ranges is indicative of what would be the case if job losses permeated deeper into the goods producing and professional services sectors than is reflected in the data.

So here we have the cruelest of laboratory experiments to prove the point about deteriorating job quality in America. We will see what happens when many of the sub-par jobs on which the country's employment picture has become so dependent, disappear overnight.

And we will see in the data, to some extent, how the ""other half"" has been living — which is to say, much better.

SUMMARY: Yes, but what about our plan for the coronavirus? Layoffs are horrible, but kudos to Airbnb for handling them as well as possible. People are increasingly ignoring distancing measures. Dr. Fauci as sex symbol.

What's our plan, Mr. President?

President Trump says we're moving into the next phase of our coronavirus response — reopening. He's acknowledging that the death counts will be much higher than he thought only a few weeks ago. He's urging Americans to view themselves as ""warriors"" and return to their lives.

Trump's motivation for reopening the economy is obvious: Our lives have been upended by the coronavirus, and our economy has been destroyed. The ""cure"" may not be worse than the disease, but it's terrible.

The president's logic is also understandable. We cannot stay ""locked down"" forever. On our current trajectory, it would take us months if not years to crush the virus the way South Korea, Germany, New Zealand, Australia, Austria, and other countries have. So continuing with the status quo indefinitely is not really an option.

But giving up on the coronavirus and focusing just on the economy is appalling, especially considering how well other countries like South Korea and Germany have dealt with this crisis.

After all, there's a lot more we could be doing. As Derek Thompson explains in The Atlantic, only a couple of months ago, South Korea and the US had the same number of cases and deaths. Now, thanks to an aggressive and competent government response, South Korea has reduced new cases of the virus to a trickle, while the US death toll is 72,000 and climbing.

We know what the president's economic plan is: Reopen the country.

But it is fair to also ask what his coronavirus plan is.

There are really only two options.

Double down. Ramp up the aggressive response that has worked in South Korea and elsewhere: Continue to build testing, contact-tracing, and isolation capacity. Order companies to make more personal protection equipment and healthcare capacity. Give funding to states and municipalities. Form partnerships with other countries. Do whatever else can be done to reduce deaths and sickness and control the spread.

Ramp up the aggressive response that has worked in South Korea and elsewhere: Continue to build testing, contact-tracing, and isolation capacity. Order companies to make more personal protection equipment and healthcare capacity. Give funding to states and municipalities. Form partnerships with other countries. Do whatever else can be done to reduce deaths and sickness and control the spread. Hope for the best. Hope we get a treatment or vaccine or reach ""herd immunity"" before too many more people die.

Trump appears to be pursuing the second option.

What's particularly frustrating and mystifying about this is that the president doesn't have to choose. He could have his cake and eat it, too. He has nearly unlimited resources. He could cautiously reopen the country and double down on mitigation and control measures.

After all, the choice here is not the coronavirus OR the economy — it's both.

Our economy won't repair itself until we all feel safe eating out, traveling, attending events, and socializing in groups again. And it won't be a government mandate that makes us feel safe. It will be seeing the number of infections and deaths continuing to drop.

So let's hope the president does more than just hope for the best.

Airbnb shows the right way to conduct layoffs during the pandemic

Tuesday's news that Airbnb is laying off 25% of its 7,500 employees is sad and not at all surprising, given how the pandemic has devastated the travel industry.

But as Shana Lebowitz reports in Insider, how Airbnb is carrying out the layoffs should be a model for other struggling companies.

Executives usually screw up this process, spreading fear by letting news of layoffs dribble out in advance, callously firing people in large groups, and not bothering to explain the strategic reason for layoffs.

Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky did everything right, Lebowitz concludes. Chesky's memo explained the strategic reasoning behind the layoffs, prepared those being laid off for one-on-one meetings with managers, offered generous severance, benefits, and career counseling, and, perhaps most important, treated those losing their jobs with compassion.

""I am truly sorry. Please know this is not your fault,"" Chesky wrote. ""The world will never stop seeking the qualities and talents that you brought to Airbnb ... that helped make Airbnb. I want to thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for sharing them with us.""

People are increasingly ignoring coronavirus restrictions, and that's alarming

Everywhere you look there are signs of rising noncompliance with our social-distancing guidelines.

In one Miami Beach park, police verbally warned more than 7,000 people about mask-wearing, prompting authorities to shut the just opened park back down. A guard at a Family Dollar was shot dead by a customer when he tried to enforce Michigan's mandatory mask policy. The Wisconsin Supreme Court looks likely to throw out the state's stay-at-home order, with one justice calling it ""the very definition of tyranny."" Even Trump and Vice President Pence have been modeling noncompliance by declining to wear face masks in places where they're recommended or required.

What a pickle! It's possible to create a virtuous cycle with restrictive public-health measures, as we've seen in countries such as Korea and New Zealand: Clear government communication, strict controls, and competence persuade people to comply with restrictive orders. The public then sees the crisis abate, appreciates the strict measures, and trusts the government to guide the reopening.

Instead, we've put ourselves in a vicious cycle. Unclear leadership, ambiguous rules, and government incompetence cast doubt on the control measures. Physical distancing can only suppress the epidemic if the vast majority of us practice it, and the vast majority will practice it only if they support it and think it's a legitimate recommendation from trusted authorities. But if the authorities themselves don't practice it, or label it tyranny as in Wisconsin, or are too heavy handed as in Miami, compliance will wane, and the disease will rise.

That's the direction we're heading. And what's unsettling is that once the public's trust is lost, the government will have a tough time regaining it. If we botched this first effort so badly, will enough of us follow government restrictions if the disease keeps flaring up?

SUMMARY: White House forecaster thinks Americans will just stop dying. Trump bars pandemic task-force members from talking to Congress. US is facing a new, more dangerous coronavirus mutation. How much will we pay for a vaccine? We need a national plan, not local plans. The 1918-19 flu caused a surge of right-wing extremism. The Big 3.

Key forecasts for coronavirus deaths are rising as states reopen. Meanwhile, a White House forecaster thinks people are just going to stop dying.

Coronavirus-related deaths in the United States are nearing 70,000.

On Monday, as Insider's Sinead Baker reports, researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington nearly doubled their US death forecast to 134,000 by early August, with more deaths expected thereafter.

The IHME increased the death forecast because the epidemic peak in the US is lasting longer than expected and new cases are declining more slowly than expected.

As Insider's Eliza Relman reported on Monday, another forecasting model, featured in a government ""situation update,"" assumes a radical acceleration in daily new cases and deaths by the end of this month.

US Department of Homeland Security presentation, via New York Times

This latter forecast was apparently preliminary, and the White House and CDC have since disavowed it. But the researcher from Johns Hopkins who put it together told The Washington Post that ""there are reopening scenarios where it could get out of control very quickly.""

Meanwhile, the White House's own model is decidedly more optimistic.

The Post reports that economist and Trump adviser Kevin Hassett has developed a model that predicts coronavirus deaths will drop sharply this month and ""essentially go to zero"" by May 15. Here's his ""cubic fit"" model overlaid with the other models.

No one knows the future. Everyone is free to come up with their own forecasts. But some forecasts have more logic supporting them than others.

And the White House's, meanwhile, seems more like a dream. — HB

The White House has barred 'Coronavirus Task Force' experts from speaking to Congress

The Trump administration this week squashed two efforts to start a broader conversation about its coronavirus response.

The White House barred the members of its pandemic task force from testifying to Congress, effectively preventing the legislative branch from asking any questions of the executive branch about the most significant global catastrophe since World War II. The White House claims it wants to keep task-force members from being distracted.

On the same day, the administration skipped a global vaccine summit designed to raise billions for research, rally public support, and start the conversation about how to collaborate globally on manufacturing and distribution.

What did the administration not skip? Self-promotion. It arranged for a friendly Fox News interview of the president inside the Lincoln Memorial, an unprecedented use of that sacred civic space.

This is a demoralizing trend: The Trump administration enthusiastically seeks any opportunity for self-promotion and aggrandizement of its COVID-19 response, any occasion when it can claim success.

But the coronavirus crisis is not a problem solved by mere claims, by the rhetorical energy the president specializes in. Solving it requires constant effort, improvement, revision, cooperation, clarity, and transparency. If the administration refuses to answer hard questions, listen to Congress, or even collaborate with allies, we'll continue to lag the world in stopping the pandemic. —DP

A study shows coronavirus may have mutated

An early draft of a study from researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory — which has not been published or peer-reviewed yet — suggests that the coronavirus mutated over the past few months. They concluded that the strain of the virus that has afflicted most people in the US is the newer version.

The researchers have not yet figured out whether one strain is significantly different or more harmful than another. If a virus mutates enough, it could have implications for treatments and vaccines, but researchers so far think the new coronavirus mutates at a very slow rate, which is promising.

In previous epidemics, such as the devastating ""Great Influenza"" of 1918-19, a second strain of the virus — the one that wiped out most of the estimated 39 million people who died — was more deadly than the first.

The challenge for vaccines, meanwhile, is that if a virus mutates a vaccine that works for one strain might not work for another.

The researchers' draft study itself is here, but it's dense. —HB

How much will a COVID-19 vaccine cost? Way way way way less than it's worth

A laboratory technician working on samples from people to be tested for the new coronavirus at ""Fire Eye"" laboratory in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province. Getty

COVID-19 vaccine trials are starting at an encouraging clip. Insider's Andrew Dunn reports on a new Pfizer one today.

But the high stakes and enormous costs of accelerating research have raised fears that a COVID-19 vaccine will be too expensive, and that whatever company makes it will score windfall profits.

Since there's not yet a vaccine, it's too early to answer the pricing and profit questions. But surveys I've seen, including this Insider story, suggest a possible cost of about $10 per dose when manufacturing gets scaled up. Here are a few key things to remember about that vaccine, when it does arrive:

It will need to be made available worldwide. There will be monumental pressure on the manufacturer and the nation that made it to license it globally. And if they don't license it, it will be pirated. It's too valuable for any country to go without it.

It will get cheaper as we learn how to make and distribute it better.

The company that makes it will earn billions in profits, even if their original research was funded by a government.

Most important, however much the vaccine costs, however huge the windfall profits to the manufacturer, it will be worth it.

Conservative estimates suggest COVID-19 will slash $3 trillion from global economic output in 2020. That's $375 per person this year alone. It will inflict trillions and trillions more damage in years to come.

If a vaccine ended up costing $100 per dose (and it definitely won't be that pricey), and we spent $780 billion to vaccinate everyone on earth, it would still be the bargain of the century. —DP

We need national leadership and a national plan

Many states in the US are beginning to reopen. Their eagerness is understandable: The pandemic and lockdowns are having a devastating effect on our economy, jobs, and lives, and we're desperate to get back to normal. And with warmer weather outside, and declining cases in some areas, patience is nearing its end.

The problem is that this initial phase of our national coronavirus-attack plan — mitigation — did not go as well as planned.

Nationwide, new cases and deaths per day have flattened (good), but they have not yet meaningfully declined (bad). Excluding the tristate area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, in fact, US cases per day are continuing to rise.

Two caveats to this. First, the economist Ian Shepardson points out that most of the increase outside of the tristate area is coming from only seven states. A trailing average of cases in 40 of 50 US states, he says, are now declining.

Second, the steady (and important) increase in US testing capacity may account for some of this increase in confirmed cases. But it probably doesn't account for all of it.

Most important, we still don't have a plan for the next phase or a leader to bring us together and lead us through it.

State and local governments do have a critical role to play. Each county, state, and region is facing a different situation, and each needs to approach their situation differently.

But US states and cities are not separate countries. US citizens — at least in normal times — travel freely from one state and city to another. Even if each state and city were capable of eliminating the virus on its own, traveling Americans would continually bring the virus with them.

If we want to get back to normal, therefore, we need a national approach, not just a state and local approach. The federal government can't just be a ""backup,"" as the Trump administration has recently been saying.

The federal government needs to lead. And the federal government needs a plan.

What do we need in this federal plan?

Mostly, funding. Funding for the states. Funding for testing. Funding for contact tracing. Funding for isolation and quarantine facilities.

But also leadership.

We need our federal government to use its resources and expertise to develop, communicate, coordinate, and execute a national and then global plan. We need regular updates from relevant experts on how the plan is going and how we're changing it as the circumstances change.

That's what our federal government is there for, after all. That's what we built it and pay it to do.

And yet, even as the country opens back up, it is clear that our federal government has no real plan. Instead, our federal government appears to be leaving the problem to someone else. —HB

Will COVID-19 lead to a rise in political extremism?

German cities with higher mortality from the 1918-19 flu voted more heavily for the Nazis in 1932-33, a New York Federal Reserve researcher concludes in a new paper.

Even after controlling for other factors including income, religion, and ethnic makeup, flu deaths corresponded to a rise in right-wing extremism 14 years later. (Though not to a rise in left-wing extremism. Voting for the communist party was unaffected.)

Will COVID-19 cause a similar extremist surge in hard-hit countries? —DP

SUMMARY: Three possible futures for the pandemic, none of which involves it just disappearing. A scary government projection calls for a skyrocketing of new cases by the end of the month.

3 possible futures for the pandemic

As the US starts to reopen, researchers have published estimates for the shape of the pandemic. They forecast that the pandemic will last 18 to 24 months, and they describe three scenarios:

1. ""Peaks and valleys."" In this scenario, the current wave — the second and highest wave on the chart below —will recede over the summer and then be followed by additional waves of similar magnitude for one to two years. The severity will vary by region and country. Different cities and countries may reimplement restrictions and mitigation measures.

Moore, Lipsitch, Barry, Osterholm

2. ""Fall peak."" The current wave would recede over the summer, as in the first scenario. But then we would be hit with a far more severe wave this fall. This is what happened in the 1918-19 ""Great Influenza"" pandemic, as well as less devastating flu pandemics in 1957-58 and 2009-10.

Moore, Lipsitch, Barry, Osterholm

3. ""Slow burn."" The most encouraging scenario. The current wave is by far the worst. And then the pandemic smolders for an additional few years while life goes on.

Moore, Lipsitch, Barry, Osterholm

Note that none of these scenarios involves the coronavirus just disappearing after this first big wave recedes.

The researchers do not address the possibility that scientists will develop a powerful drug in the next few months that can ""cure"" the disease or a vaccine that will prevent it. They note that vaccines have not played a role in prior flu pandemics.

To emphasize: The top chart calls for the skyrocketing of daily new cases to more than 200,000 by the end of May, up from about 30,000 now.

The presentation does not explain why the model predicts this acceleration.

An hour after the document was published, the White House disavowed it. A White House representative told Insider's Eliza Relman that it ""is not a White House document nor has it been presented to the Coronavirus Task Force or gone through interagency vetting"" and that ""this data is not reflective of any of the modeling done by the task force or data that the task force has analyzed.""

So now we need to understand where those projections came from and whether any government experts believe they are realistic.

Here are the historical numbers in the presentation, which have plateaued at about 30,000 new cases and 2,000 deaths per day:

Yes, the coronavirus is roughest on old and sick people, but it's awful for some younger people too

Insider's Aria Bendix, a healthy reporter in her 20s, developed nasty COVID-19 symptoms in late March, which she described here. Nearly 50 days later, she's still not back to full strength.

Aria's not alone. Here, she interviews four other otherwise healthy people in their 20s and 30s who have been sick for more than a month.

Meanwhile, Insider's Lydia Ramsey describes how doctors in New York City continue to be surprised and alarmed by the number of younger people who are getting COVID-19, as well as how serious it is for some of them.

In New York, 18- to 44-year-olds make up about 10% of total cases. More than 4,300 of them have been hospitalized. Nearly 300 of them have died. —HB

Will summer help?

There is still hope that warmer temperatures will halt or at least slow the spread of the virus.

The researchers in the study and the article referenced above conclude that summer will reduce the transmissibility of the virus by about 20% — enough to slow it down, but not enough to eliminate it. —HB

Dictators should be great during a pandemic. Why are they botching it?

Russia's COVID-19 outbreak is blazing, with record cases reported on Sunday. Wouldn't you think Vladimir Putin would be handling it better?

Authoritarians love nothing more than ordering the government to do whatever they want, imposing tight controls on the population, and wantonly enacting emergency restrictions, so you'd expect Putin and his fellow authoritarians to shine during the pandemic. But it's not working out that way.

Across the world, dictators, as well as democratically elected leaders with authoritarian tendencies, are doing poorly. Putin seems bored by the crisis. Iran continues to be a wreck. The dictator of Belarus, denying that the coronavirus is a threat, has ordered life to continue as usual, leading to one of the world's fastest-rising infection rates. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's he-man approach— combining skepticism of science with macho recklessness — has made a mess of Brazil's response.

This isn't a hard-and-fast rule. Plenty of vibrant democracies — Spain, Italy — have struggled with outbreaks, and China almost certainly extinguished its outbreak more rapidly thanks to its totalitarian tools. But in general, controlling the virus seems easier when there's public trust in government, reliable and transparent data, and visible popular support for action — all of which are hard for authoritarians to muster. Also authoritarians tend to prefer problems they can solve quickly with force or rhetoric, neither of which works on the coronavirus.

Oh, and it doesn't help to build trust in public health when any health professional who casts doubt on the government's response falls out a window the next day, as seems to happen in Russia. —DP

Vote-by-mail data that could worry Republicans

Voters wearing masks line up at Riverside High School in Milwaukee for Wisconsin's primary election on April 7. Morry Gash/AP Images

The savage battle over voting by mail in the 2020 election could be shaped by some unexpected news out of Wisconsin. Last month, as Wisconsin held in-person voting during the pandemic, the US Supreme Court refused to extend the deadline for mail-in ballots. The ruling was seen as a big win for Republicans.

Less noticed was that the court did allow Wisconsin to accept ballots postmarked by Election Day. Under previous rules, Wisconsin accepted only ballots that arrived by Election Day. The Washington Post found that in Wisconsin's two biggest cities, 10% of all ballots were postmarked before Election Day and arrived after Election Day. In other words, 10% of voters in those cities wouldn't have even been counted in previous years.

The Wisconsin vote could be anomalous: Wisconsin officials and voters had only a few days to prepare and no precedent for pandemic voting. The rest of the country will have months to set rules for pandemic-afflicted balloting.

Still the Wisconsin mail-in data may alarm Republicans, who generally benefit from fewer people voting. Expect them to seek to limit the SCOTUS ruling and to persuade state legislatures to find other ways to restrict voting by mail. Seven states, all Republican-controlled, have already limited balloting by mail to elderly voters. —DP

And The New York Times speculates how the pandemic will transform open-plan offices into places with sneeze guards, push-down air vents, and way more space between coworkers. It's going to be a good time to be an interior designer. —DP

Biden should release his Senate archives only if Trump releases his tax returns

As Insider's Nicole Einbinder reported last week, Joe Biden has 1,875 boxes full of records at the University of Delaware from his time in the Senate that are unavailable to the public. One or two of these boxes, the theory goes, might contain references to Tara Reade, the former staffer who recently accused Biden of sexually assaulting her.

Biden denied the allegations in an interview on Friday and said that the Delaware boxes didn't contain any materials related to Reade.

Reade has said that the boxes aren't likely to contain any references to a sexual assault because she didn't tell Biden's team about it.

Naturally, people are still calling on Biden to unseal all those boxes. If he doesn't, the existence of the boxes threatens to become the same sort of ""what's he hiding?"" weapon that was used so effectively against Hillary Clinton in 2016. (""But her emails…"")

The desire to search all potential evidence to get to the bottom of the story is understandable. But the request that Biden unseal his boxes when President Donald Trump still has yet to release his tax returns seems an absurd double standard. —HB

Warren Buffett gives up on airlines

The Oracle of Omaha announced that he had dumped all his airline holdings. He thinks it's unlikely that as many people will fly in the next two to three years as they did last year. And he believes that even if capacity returns to 70% to 80% of what it once was, the airlines will still have too many planes.

History supports this view.

The last big gut punch to the industry came after 9/11. The fallout from that event was shorter and less devastating than the current one. But still … the economist David Rosenberg of Rosenberg Research points that it took about seven years for travel spending on airlines to recover. —HB

The Big 3*!

YouTubers pretending to be Jimmy Fallon tricked the ""Tiger King"" star Carole Baskin into doing an interview.

Insider's Lindsay Dodgson has the inside story of who the tricksters are, how they did it, and what they learned about the famous reality-TV star who some think killed her husband and fed him to her big cats.

Former NBA star Charles Barkley has bad news for LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Wilt Chamberlain, and others who are occasionally thought to be the best of all time: Michael Jordan was better.

Few people who watched Jordan's dominance in the 1990s would disagree.

Trump's latest scapegoat for his bungled coronavirus response is Dr. Anthony Fauci.

The president told Fox News that Fauci told him the virus was no big deal.

Crises always have a habit of clarifying things. The coronavirus crisis is no different.

Once a treatment for the virus has been found, the debates about shutdown and easing restrictions have passed, and the recession has reared its ugly head, nothing less than the world order itself must be clarified. Or to be more specific: the matter of alliance. Where does Europe stand? On the side of the US or China?

Let us first look at a few assumptions and a few facts. America, the democratic world power, is currently governed by a narcissistic president — a man seen to be vulgar, uneducated, and with a volatile character who lacks any sense whatsoever for institutions. Half of Americans and three quarters of Europeans have no respect for him.

And yet, whether by accident, thanks to good advisers or a keen instinct, this president has managed to make some correct decisions. He lowered taxes to stabilize the US economy, withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, supported Israel, increased pressure on Europe to show more solidarity in NATO funding, and pressured the dysfunctional WHO.

China, on the other hand, the non-democratic world power, is currently controlled by a president with a measured vanity — a man who is supposedly sensitive, highly educated and cultivated, a personality who thinks and acts with a highly consistent and long-term perspective demonstrating great sensibility for the interests of China's unitary state.

And because Xi Jinping is said to look a little like Winnie the Pooh, the bear from the eponymous children's book, Chinese censorship forbids the use of either the name or the image of Winnie Pooh. Anyone who explicitly criticizes the government is punished.

Global supremacy thanks to digital surveillance

Xi Jinping has been General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the Central Military Commission since 2012, and President of the People's Republic of China since 2013. In 2018, he lifted all limitations on his term of office, meaning he could continue to rule China for life.

He is a politician who, more than anything else, has continued and accelerated the economic reforms that were first introduced by Deng Xiaoping in the 1970s and reached new dimensions under Jiang Zemin. And thanks to tightened digital surveillance, he has been able to push China towards a position of global dominance as part of a seemingly friendly and peaceful international expansion.

The key date of this strategy is December 11, 2001, when China was accepted as a full member of the WTO following 15 years of negotiations. A great decision for China. But perhaps the biggest mistake made in recent history by the western market economies.

Since then, the US's share in the gross world product (GWP) dropped from 20.18% in 2001 to 15.03% (2019). Europe's share dropped from 23.5% to 16.05%, a drop of 7.45 percentage points in less than two decades. While China's share increased from 7.84% to 19.24% in the same period, with an average annual growth rate of around 9%.

The big mistake was to expose democratic market economies to a non-democratic state capitalism that exploits easier trading and competitive conditions without subjecting itself to the same rules. Asymmetry instead of reciprocity was the result.

The process of ""change through trade"" actually did take place. However, not quite in the way expected by the West. China has become even more authoritarian and economically stronger, while the West has become weaker.

What is our conclusion from all this? America has clearly decided to pursue a policy of 'decoupling' from China. If Europe does not want to see its freedom subverted by Beijing, it must decide which of the two countries to ally with, and it must do so soon.

We are told time and again that it is not a case of either-or, that it's about having the best of both worlds. The opposite is true. There is no need for finely crafted rhetoric here, we need to make a fundamental political decision. China or the US. It is no longer possible to go with both. The issue has come to a head under Trump. But it is ultimately not about him.

The truth is that US policy towards China would likely not change if the Democrats were in power. The issue of China is now a bipartisan one.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi does not cede an inch to the US President. And yet, responding to my question at the Munich Security Conference whether she agreed in substance to Trump's China policy, she answered they had ""agreement in that regard"" to the surprise of everyone present.

Pelosi described China as a ""government that does not share our values"" and spoke of an authoritarian ""form of aggression."" Many in the room that day do business with China. It suddenly seemed a little naïve that they hoped a Democrat in the White House might be more China-friendly.

Mathias Döpfner Max Threlfall

A Democratic president might distance the US distance even further from China, despite Trump's attempts to discredit the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden by accusing him of being soft on China. ""China wants Sleepy Joe soo badly"" the president cajoled on Twitter. But there is little evidence to support this.

Biden was one of the first and few international politicians to speak out against the Chinese re-education camps holding hundreds of thousands of Uighurs.

The rise of China to become a global economic power is increasingly seen as a threat to US interests. A friend of the enemy soon becomes an enemy itself. If Germany decides to expand its 5G infrastructure with Huawei, that will place an enormous strain on transatlantic relations. It would be a turning point, as America could no longer trust Germany.

The transatlantic alliance would be at risk

Washington has made it clear that there will be no cooperation on intelligence matters with the secret service of a country that allows highly sensitive data to end up in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.

If Washington gave up its close intelligence cooperation with Europe, this would have devastating consequences. A decoupling from the US would hit us much harder than a decoupling from China, both in terms of our economy and security.

Decoupling Germany and the US would mean relegating to the dustbin of history the alliance that helped rebuild a democratic Germany after World War II, that secured supplies to the city during the Berlin Blockade by organizing the airlift guaranteeing West Berlin's survival, and which directly and indirectly made German reunification possible.

Europe has been avoiding the alliance question for a long time, but is the time to make that decision. This does not directly have to do with the coronavirus crisis. And it certainly has nothing to do with the question of where the virus originated.

The crisis focuses the way we look at long-standing dependencies, even those in so-called vital supply chains, how we see fundamental differences in communication and crisis management, and our regard for what is ultimately a completely different concept of humanity. Employees from the Robert Koch Institute estimate that China kept the virus secret during very decisive weeks, then played it down and, by doing so, facilitated its spread worldwide.

Companies in the crisis at bargain prices

However, it is the global recession unleashed by the pandemic that has brought vital questions to a head. Should we allow the state capitalism of a totalitarian global power to continue to infiltrate or even take over key industries like banking (Deutsche Bank), automotive (Daimler, Volvo), robotics (Kuka) and trading hubs (Port of Piraeus)?

That is precisely why the alliance question must be clarified now, and fast! The current crisis is massively weakening the European economy, which could very soon place us before extremely unpleasant decisions: Should we offer our companies to China in the post-corona era for bargain prices driven downwards by economic depression? Our should we finally draw a clear line in the sand?

If we do not assert the principle of true reciprocity now — that is, China can only do here what we are allowed to do in China — then we never will. If we do not manage to assert ourselves, then Europe could suffer a similar fate to Africa, on a gradual descent towards becoming a Chinese colony.

Or, to put it in Henry Kissinger's words: If America and Europe do not manage to become a community of interest again, America will become a giant island. And the European Union will become ""an appendage of Eurasia.""

However, Europe has failed so far to clearly state where it stands, preferring to play piggy in the middle, able to tip the scales either way. Even believing its opportunism to be a sign of independence and courage. However, Europe will never be able to hold onto its position as everybody's darling. When it comes to questions of world order, you cannot have your cake and eat it.

Europe's economy likes making deals with China and does not want to be interrupted in those pursuits. Politicians are dithering. The Italians have even been willing to subjugate themselves to China's ridiculous euphemism of the ""New Silk Road.""

We increasingly hear words of admiration in Europe about the speed and efficiency of the Chinese market economy, the rigorous nature of its crisis management. All the time gladly ignoring the fact that China's successes rest on a highly perfected system of digital surveillance that translates the perversions of the KGB and Stasi into the 21st century.

Europe has two options in terms of an alliance. It can continue to expand on the traditional transatlantic alliance despite Trump, including the explicit and closer involvement of a post-Brexit UK and other allies such as Canada, Australia, Switzerland and the democratic countries of Asia. Or it can decide in favor of closer economic ties to China, bearing in mind the economic ties are always political ties as well.

If this latter path is chosen, then we might all wake up one day to find ourselves in a gruesome society, on the side of China and the states loosely associated with it — like Russia, Iran and other autocracies. A shifting world order.

Economic relations with China might seem harmless to many Europeans today, but they could soon lead to political dependence and ultimately to the end of a free and liberal Europe. The European Union has the choice. But above all Germany, Europe's economic motor, has the choice.

Should we make a pact with an authoritarian regime or should we work to strengthen a community of free, constitutionally governed market economies with liberal societies? It is remarkable that German politics, with its love of moralizing, seems to throw its values out the window when dealing with China. What is at stake here is nothing less than what kind of society we want to live in and our concept of humanity.

Germany and Europe should decide to remain with the US and pursue a strict process of decoupling from China. The exact details of this decoupling will be one of the most interesting questions of the future.

It would happen late, but not too late. It would be expensive, but not too expensive. Germany, for example, has an annual trade volume of around 200 billion euros with China. All German trade is valued at 2.4 trillion euros, so the loss of Chinese trade would be massive, but not insupportable. The coroanvirus recession is already bringing Germany to a new and devastating bottom line, but that gives us a unique opportunity to get us back on the right track.

The question as to which leader — Trump or Xi Jinping — is presented by the media as a more likeable figure is of little import in this decision. And there is no question that the American president is making it difficult for us.

But the transatlantic alliance, our community of interests and values that has grown historically over time, should be more important in the long term than our widespread frustration about the current American administration. We must concentrate on the post-Trump era. For all its weaknesses, America is still the free world's largest and most successful power.

Just as misleading are references to the fact that America also violates data protection rights, or the principles of the rule of law, that it disregards human rights and makes many other terrible mistakes. There is a difference: China has no data protection for its citizens at all, no rule of law. China has no opposition in parliament, no freedom of the press, no freedom of opinion. And China has no human rights as we understand them.

When both sides make mistakes, that does not mean that the truth automatically lies somewhere in the middle. It depends on the context in which these mistakes are made, whether they can be called mistakes at all or recognized as such.

States need a suitable constitution as a self-correcting mechanism. Democracy may die in darkness, but dictatorship thrives in it. In America, people laugh at their president. Something that is forbidden in China. And the authoritarian power of the latter even stretches as far as Germany. When the Daimler Group (whose biggest single shareholder is Chinese) quoted the Dalai Lama – an enemy of the state in China – in an Instagram post, the company's CEO Dieter Zetsche had to apologize twice to the government in Beijing.

Is that Europe's future?

If current European and, above all, German policy on China continues, this will lead to a gradual decoupling from America and a step-by-step infiltration and subjugation by China.

Economic dependence will only be the first step. Political influence will follow. In the future, whoever dominates the field of artificial intelligence will dominate first economically and then politically.

At the present time, this race is between the US and China alone. China's great advantage is that it does not have any regulation as a democratic corrective. Whatever serves to strengthen the unitary Chinese state is allowed. This makes the Chinese state more unscrupulous but, more than anything, it makes it faster.

It is no small probability that Beijing will eventually overtake Silicon Valley. This is where European research excellence can become a decisive factor. On what side do we want to use it?

In the end, it is quite simple. What kind of future do we want for Europe? An alliance with an imperfect democracy or with a perfect dictatorship? It should be an easy decision for us to make. It is about more than just money. It is about our freedom, about Article 1 of Germany's Basic Law, the greatest legal term that ever existed: human dignity.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

But they now face massive budget deficits.

Without immediate federal aid, states will start be forced to slash their budgets, laying off workers en masse, cutting funds for education and healthcare, and more.

Michael Leachman is Senior Director of State Fiscal Research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

A week ago, President Trump, Democratic leaders in Congress, and the National Governors Association's bipartisan leaders all expressed support for Washington providing fiscal relief for cash-strapped states in the next stimulus measure.

They recognized that, due to what's becoming the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, states are facing budget shortfalls of unprecedented size and — without relief — they'll start laying off first responders, teachers, and health care workers and cutting spending in other ways that will deepen the recession.

Now, however, Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and other Senate Republicans are suggesting that the state budget crisis reflects the fiscal irresponsibility of Democrat-run states and arguing that Washington shouldn't bail them out because that would only reward their profligacy.

But, as John Adams said, facts are stubborn things. And the fact is that states face a budget crisis not because they've mismanaged their finances. It's because all over America, in states led by Republicans as well as Democrats, businesses have closed and millions have lost their jobs, and, as a result, state tax revenues have dried up at a record pace. States get 70% of their tax revenues from sales and income taxes, and both are collapsing because places where people shop are closed and the millions who are now laid off aren't paying income taxes.

To prevent states from making deep budget cuts and imposing massive layoffs that would make the economic crisis even worse, the federal government must provide significant fiscal relief as soon as possible and ensure that it remains in place until the economy recovers.

States are facing a massive budget crisis

Unlike the federal government, almost all states must balance their budgets each year. As their current fiscal years draw to a close on June 30, their shrinking revenues are creating huge shortfalls that they must fill this spring as well as projections of more enormous shortfalls for the coming years.

At the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, we project states will have a combined $650 billion in shortfalls from fiscal years 2020 through 2022. Many local governments will face shortfalls on top of that.

Without significant relief from the federal government, states will have to take drastic action to balance their budgets, such as slashing education and healthcare, laying off teachers and other workers, and canceling contracts with businesses. That would take money out of the economy at just the wrong time, making the recession deeper, delaying the recovery, and hurting millions of families.

States were in good shape before the pandemic

Far from mismanaging their finances of late, states did a reasonable job in recent years of preparing for a recession, with ""rainy day"" funds of about 7.5% of state budgets, which was higher than before the last recession. Their total reserves, which include the year-end balances in their general funds, were also higher.

Also in better shape were the state trust funds that support unemployment insurance programs. The problem is that nobody could have predicted that a global pandemic would send the economy into such a steep nosedive and eviscerate state finances so quickly.

States have hardly been overspending of late. State general fund spending for current operations — basic functions like schools, healthcare, the justice system, and public health — is significantly lower as a share of the economy than before the last recession. Frankly, states have spent too little in some key areas, shortchanging investments needed for future economic growth.

For instance, states have fewer teachers and other school workers than a decade ago, even though they now have many more students. State funding for higher education per pupil is down an average of 13% from about a decade ago in inflation-adjusted terms, forcing colleges to raise tuition and putting college out of reach for more families. And, as a share of the economy, states are spending far less on infrastructure than decades ago, shortchanging another key tool for economic growth.

Funding for critical services

McConnell's suggestion that states would use fiscal relief to bail out their pension systems is badly off-base. For starters, they would put fiscal relief dollars into their general funds, not the separate trust funds that cover pensions.

While states and localities make payments into the pension funds to help cover future obligations, these payments comprise an overage of just 4.7% of state and local general fund spending.

Rather than help the states, McConnell has said that Washington should let them go bankrupt. That would do nothing to help the economy now, however, and it would hurt the states in the coming years.

Bankruptcy lets individuals and businesses ease their debt and cancel their obligations, but state debt isn't high by historical standards and states should be able to meet those obligations when the economy recovers. Since the late 1800s, only one state (Arkansas in 1934) has ever defaulted on its general obligation debt.

Letting states declare bankruptcy could significantly raise their borrowing costs for major transportation and other projects because investors, who would worry about getting repaid, would demand higher interest payments.

Rather than turn an unprecedented state budget crisis into just one more partisan brawl in Washington, the White House and Senate Republican leaders should support the desperately needed fiscal relief that will protect the jobs of many thousands of workers, ease the deep economic downturn, and soften its blow for millions of families.

SUMMARY: Four months later, the US coronavirus response is still one of the worst in the world. How to follow this bizarre presidential campaign. That armed protest in Michigan makes the ""reopen"" movement look thuggish and dumb. Turns out, ""Groundhog Day"" is a horror movie. The most popular stories on Insider this morning...

A few months in, the US coronavirus response is still one of the worst in the world

Back in January, the United States and South Korea each identified their first confirmed coronavirus case on the same day.

South Korea responded immediately and competently, by testing, tracing, and isolating cases and getting ahead of the epidemic.

The United States, meanwhile, initially denied that the virus was a threat, blew its first attempt to roll out tests, and then never marshaled the strong federal response that could have slowed the outbreak before it really got rolling.

Three months later, here's where things stand.

South Korea is close to exterminating the virus:

The US has, finally, after about six weeks of half-hearted lockdowns, ""flattened the curve."" But the US is still confirming about 30,000 cases a day — with the true number of cases likely far higher. The US is behind where it needs to be on testing and tracing capacity and lacks a clear strategy for isolating cases and protecting the most vulnerable.

The tragic result of the US's poor response is the highest number of fatalities in the world. More than 63,000 Americans have died, and counting. As a chart of ""deaths per million"" shows, the US has company in this grim statistic: The UK, Spain, Italy, and other countries were similarly blindsided and slow to react. But a glance at South Korea shows what could have been.

So, what's the outlook from here?

As pressure and frustration about lockdowns build, the US is starting to reopen. The frustration is understandable: The pandemic has clobbered our economy and upended our lives. But without a strong testing-tasting-and-isolation response—or a more sophisticated and optimized set of restrictions—""shelter-in-place"" lockdowns have been our most effective tactic. Most experts think the reopening move is premature and will likely lead to a reacceleration of outbreaks in some areas of the country.

The US has ramped testing capacity, but is still far behind where it needs to be. The US is now doing a little more than 200,000 tests per day, but experts believe it needs to be doing many times more. Experts also estimate that the US will need to hire as many as 300,000 contact tracers to interview everyone who has a confirmed case, figure out who they interacted with, and warn and test them. And, because the coronavirus transmits easily within the home, the US also needs to develop a clear isolation and quarantine approach.

US states and cities can and must execute much of this strategy. But they need federal money, resources, and leadership to do it. Alas, the US still lacks a strong, competent federal response.

Our best hope is that infections slow sharply, testing and tracing capacity continues to increase, and we discover strong drugs and treatments before the fall flu season. Otherwise, we'll be living with this pandemic well into next year and beyond. —HB

And that was just this week!

The 2020 presidential election takes place six months from Sunday, so we're at the start of what promises to be one of the strangest political seasons in American history. The pandemic has played 52-card pickup with the campaign—the Democratic primaries more-or-less called off, the Democratic nominee campaigning from his basement, the conventions on the brink of cancellation, Election Day itself at risk, the presumed campaign issues—strong economy, impeachment, corruption, immigration—made obsolete by the COVID-19 catastrophe.

This disarray and uncertainty mean that we're going to have to follow this campaign differently than we have in the past. The 2020 race will not have traditional campaign events, so a lot of the natural color of the campaign will vanish. The overwhelming nature of the pandemic and the economic collapse will flummox traditional forecasting tools. Instead, the election will likely boil down to three key questions. These, not all the swirl, are what to pay attention to in coming months.

First, how much blame and credit is Trump getting for the pandemic, the economic collapse, and any potential rebound? How much is he being held responsible for whatever direction the country seems to be going in November?

Second, is Biden a credible candidate, or will he be seriously damaged by either the Reade accusation or something else? Depending on where we are with question one, he doesn't have to be good, just barely viable, to defeat Trump

Third, and most importantly: Instead of looking at polls, look at the mechanics of voting. The variable impact of the pandemic — and how partisan state officials respond to that — could cause vast differences in how the election actually takes place in different states. It may matter less which candidate has strong support in a state than how that state is conducting its election — by mail or in person, in the midst of an outbreak or during a quiet time, with more open polling stations or fewer. — DP

Armed protest in the Michigan statehouse diminishes the reopen movement

A militia group with no political affiliation from Michigan stands in front of the Governors office after protesters occupied the state capitol building during a vote to approve the extension of Governor Gretchen Whitmer's emergency declaration/stay-at-home order due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, at the state capitol in Lansing, Michigan Seth Herald/Reuters

Yesterday's protest in Michigan represented a new, disturbing development in the reopen movement. The peaceful crowd that swarmed the lobby of the state capitol, protesting the ongoing state of emergency, included at least half-a-dozen heavily armed men.

Michigan law permits open-carry even inside the state capitol (though not on the legislative floor), so the men were breaking no laws. Still, the images of them occupying the public galleries above the lobby were disturbing: Some Michigan legislators wore bulletproof vests as they entered the building.

The armed display distorts a critical public debate. The display in a state capitol — in the place built for peaceful, civil debate — warps the work legislators need to do, and overlays it with menace. You can't argue with a loaded gun.

It's also worth asking whether those praising these armed protesters would have responded the same way had a group of African-American men, similarly armed, done the same thing. —DP

SUMMARY: One thing that makes the lockdowns difficult is that most Americans don't feel like we're doing anything to help. A horrifying statistic that shows how many restaurant workers have been whacked by this crisis—and how little the government has done to help. A former prosecutor, a Democrat, is skeptical of the sexual assault claim against Biden. Should cities just ban cars on some streets forever? And, your mail!

Do you feel useless? You're not alone.

One of the hardest things about the pandemic is that it's difficult for most of us to be useful.

Some people are finding spectacular ways to help — doctors and farmers and nursing home attendants, and also garage entrepreneurs 3-D printing masks.

But for most us, the primary obligation during this period has been stasis. We've been told that the best way to help is to do nothing.

There's a wonderful new Caitlin Flanagan essay in the Atlantic about how her father lost his college years when World War II broke out. He joined the Navy. The world turned upside down, and there was something he — and virtually all of his peers — were able to do to help.

After 9/11, President Bush exhorted Americans to shop and ""get down to Disney World."" Bush was widely mocked for this — I probably mocked him myself. But he was on to something. The best way for Americans to reduce the fear that terrorists seek to spread — the best way to be useful — was to quickly return to normal life — to shop and go to Disney World.

This is an important lesson to remember as the Reopen debate becomes more heated. I suspect what many people are thinking about when they talk about reopening is not the raging 100-keg party they want to have. They want to find a way to contribute that isn't just huddling at home. Huddling at home feels cowardly, hidden, and impotent.

Humans are allergic to inaction, and long to be useful. That's why so many thousands of people have signed up to be directly infected by the coronavirus as part of a vaccine trial, why so many volunteer opportunities are oversubscribed.

We'd be in better shape as a nation — and the reopen debate would be less poisonous — if our leaders could find more ways to make more of us feel useful, or even be useful. Sitting on the couch doesn't feel like enough. —DP

Two shocking numbers about the restaurant catastrophe

The food-service industry accounted for 60% of March job losses, but according to Insider's Sara Silverstein's interview with chef and food TV host Andrew Zimmern the industry received only 9% of the funds from the Paycheck Protection Program, the small business lending program set up by Congress. — DP

A former prosecutor says he's skeptical about the sexual assault allegation against former Vice President Biden, but his own political preferences are clear

Amid growing calls for Biden himself to address the sexual assault allegation recently made against him — his campaign has said it didn't happen, but he himself hasn't answered in-depth questions — a former federal prosecutor explains in USA Today why he's skeptical about the claim.

The former prosecutor, Michael Stern, says his default view is to believe women who come forward with assault allegations. But he says that very occasionally — twice in a 30-year career — he dismissed cases because he became convinced that the stories he was being told weren't true.

Stern doesn't mention his personal political preferences in the op-ed, but his Twitter bio make them clear: ""#Resisting all things Trump,"" the bio reads. ""#BlueNoMatterWho."" During the sexual-assault hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Stern wrote op-eds that take the other side of at least one of the points he makes while assessing the credibility of Biden's accuser, former staffer Tara Reade.

In his USA Today op-ed, Stern cites 9 reasons for skepticism of Reade, among them her 27-year reporting delay and the lack of a record of a formal complaint that Reade says she filed. On the first point, Stern explained in a column during the Kavanaugh hearings the many reasons why some women do wait years and decades to come forward, or never to speak out at all.

Tara Reade's allegation against Biden is critically important. It could impact the election, and, with it, the future of the world. So as Biden himself has suggested, the facts and interpretations should be scrutinized.

Some readers of Stern's column will note his political preferences and discount everything he says. Others will judge the points he makes independently of his motivations for making them.

No one will ever know for certain what happened in that hallway back in 1993, or even if anything happened at all. Instead, as additional information and interpretations emerge, we will develop our own views of the allegation,the participants, and those who comment on the allegations just as we have with the many sexual assault and harassment allegations made against President Trump. — HB

A new twist in the story about the couple who drank fish-tank cleaner after President Trump touted a similar-sounding coronavirus wonder drug

As you may remember, shortly after the President began extolling the benefits of an old malaria drug called hydroxychloroquine for use against the coronavirus, a woman in Arizona reported that her husband had died after she suggested that they take some of a similar-sounding chemical, which was in fact fish-tank cleaner.

The distraught woman, who had also ended up in the hospital, blamed the President and said she didn't know why anyone would ever listen to him.

This story was cited by some as an inevitable consequence of Trump's reckless promotion of unproven quack remedies in press conferences. It was cited by others as evidence of nothing more than human stupidity.

But it turns out the moral of the story may be something else altogether.

The Washington Free Beacon reports that the homicide division of the Mesa City, Arizona police department are now conducting an investigation into the husband's death and requested a recording to the wife's interview with the outlet. Rather than having been nudged into tragedy by the President's ramblings, it seems, there may have been something else going on. — HB

Should cities take advantage of the pandemic to close streets to cars?

Cities have closed or are planning to close more than 1,000 miles of streets to cars because of COVID-19.

1,000 miles!

The street closures, which include everything from hundreds of miles of pop-up bike lanes in Paris to 11 miles of car-free parkways in Louisville, certainly make sense as a temporary measure. The pandemic has slashed urban commuting, and social distancing means all of us need more space when we go outside.

This is policy by tragedy, so bike and pedestrian activists are careful not to be gleeful, but they're also using the #Covid19streets hashtag to make the case for making changes permanent. Obviously some roads must reopen when commuters and shoppers return. But it's also likely that cities may rebound faster with better infrastructure for walkers and cyclists.

As anyone who's lived through a neighborhood bike lane debate knows, city dwellers grumble before streets go car free or parking spaces disappear, but they almost always end up cherishing the space to bike and walk. — DP

And now... your thoughts!

On ""Why didn't Pence wear a mask?""

First, the results of our poll! About a third of you think the reason Pence didn't wear a mask at the Mayo Clinic is that ""he wants Trump to keep him on the ticket."" Another third of you believe he had multiple reasons for doing so:



And now, some of your letters:

Pence didn't wear a mask because he's brave, and bravery is inspiring

As a registered independent voting older American I'd like to present you with a different angle, one that many more centrist older Americans may find more acceptable. Pence didn't wear a mask to show that we can't live in fear forever and that wearing a mask for the rest of our lives is not a cure-all either.

You're too young to remember the Communist witch hunt and how that snowballed into a serious issue in the US and the subsequent hiding in bunkers and under our school desks because you never knew when a nuclear bomb was coming. But somebody at some point finally said enough is enough and figured out that yes, there is a threat but no, we can not allow this to all consume our lives.

Bravo to Pence for showing courage as is his right to do. It's not a law to wear a mask (not yet, anyway), and somebody has to step up and show that you can resume your life without fear. Lastly, if Pence is the only person in the room not wearing the protective security of a face mask wouldn't he be less likely to contract the virus or give it to someone else? — from reader B.C.

Pence is Trump's lapdog

Pence is Trump's lapdog, reading from a script whenever he's on TV, kowtowing to his boss.

He and Trump are an embarrassment to our country. Pence's stunt at the Mayo clinic is reprehensible, at best.

The Mayo Clinic should have refused to let him in the hospital. While the Mayo Clinic is renowned worldwide as a leader in the medical field, Pence is a politician. Pence would have looked like an idiot, and the Mayo Clinic would have further enhanced it's reputation as a top-notch quality medical institution that stands by its principles. — from reader G.C.

On ""Blaming the victims of COVID-19"":

The point is that people are dying because they're listening to Trump

I have not read the New York Times article you refer to, but I have read the Washington Post article. Although you state that the Post paints a subtle, sympathetic portrait…,"" you go on to say that ""I don't get the point of these stories, which reduce rich, complicated lives to an ironic punchline.""

I think that is an unfair characterization of the Post article. The article did not mock his beliefs, but I think pointed out how people like him have been and may continue to be harmed by their faith in a president who spews out medical nonsense and is failing to lead. Trump's failure of leadership is harming all Americans, both in terms of medical advice and economically, especially those who support him. Just look at the jump in poison control calls following the president's bleach comment. That is what comes through to me from the Post article, not a punchline. — from reader B.M.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo has become the face of coronavirus competence in government, but he's a big part of the reason the crisis in New York grew to such devastating proportions.

The New York governor's star has shone brightly during the pandemic, especially in contrast to New York's tone-deaf and perpetually annoyed Mayor Bill de Blasio, who despite living in a publicly owned mansion in the middle of a spacious park insists on conducting nonessential travel to Brooklyn to walk around a park he likes better.

Compared with President Donald Trump, who says he takes ""no responsibility"" for the pandemic and treats his own public-health briefings as quasi campaign rallies, Cuomo is Winston Churchill.

Cuomo's daily briefings are sober but empathetic. He lays out the hard facts and gloomy predictions, yet he doesn't sensationalize. He presents himself as the adult in the room, in command of the situation and working hard for his constituents.

At a moment when a leader is needed, Cuomo seems born for the moment. It's a great story, but it leaves out some crucial details.

Cuomo gets to play hero in part because of his own mistakes

Cuomo conceded in an interview with Axios this week that he wished he ""blew the bugle"" on the coming crisis sooner. He also made a fair point that when ""China said basically, it was under control, don't worry, we should've worried.""

But then Cuomo came to bring the misplaced blame and revisionist history.

""Where was The New York Times, where was The Wall Street Journal, where was all the bugle blowers who should say, 'Be careful, there's a virus in China that may be in the United States?'"" Cuomo asked during an interview with Axios this week.

Well, actually, The New York Times wrote 450 stories on the novel coronavirus between January 9 and March 1, according to its metro editor.

On January 30, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 an international public-health emergency. On February 25, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told Americans to prepare for widespread infections.

Meanwhile, on March 2, Cuomo said: ""Excuse our arrogance as New Yorkers, I speak for the mayor also on this one, we think we have the best healthcare system on the planet right here in New York. So, when you're saying what happened in other countries versus what happened here, we don't even think it's going to be as bad as it was in other countries. We are fully coordinated, we are fully mobilized.""

New York was not fully coordinated, nor was it fully mobilized.

Testing was slow. Nonprofit social-service agencies that serve the most vulnerable couldn't get answers either. And medical experts like the former CDC director Tom Frieden said ""so many deaths could have been prevented"" had New York issued its stay-at-home order just ""days earlier"" than it did.

On March 19, when New York's schools had already been closed, Cuomo said ""in many ways, the fear is more dangerous than the virus.""

True enough, and we'll be debating for a long time whether the near-total national lockdown and subsequent economic ruin achieved the stated goal of mitigating the damage in lives lost better than alternative options might have.

But even with New York's stay-at-home orders, the city and surrounding counties' healthcare systems quickly became overwhelmed to the point that citizens were receiving text messages from the government telling them not to call 911 unless they had a life-threatening emergency.

Cuomo's petty fights with Bill de Blasio are not helpful

Cuomo's rivalry with his fellow Democrat de Blasio is well-documented. But repeatedly pulling rank on the mayor in public has sent mixed messages to a besieged state and city.

When de Blasio wanted to close New York City's schools, which arguably happened way too late, Cuomo said it wasn't de Blasio's decision. But then they closed anyway. Cuomo initially undercut de Blasio when the mayor said city schools might stay closed until September. But that now seems likely, too.

When de Blasio said New Yorkers should prepare to shelter in place, which was already happening on the West Coast, Cuomo again cut him off at the heels.

And most recently, when de Blasio said beaches might have to be closed throughout the summer, Cuomo said any such decision would have to be done in coordination with neighboring states.

This isn't to say Cuomo's pushback on de Blasio's proposals are inherently incorrect. It's more that a truly effective leader would work this all out behind the scenes and not in front of an exceptionally anxious public in need of clear guidance on how they're allowed to live their lives during a crisis with no end in sight.

Cuomo has spent years waiting for his hero turn, as exemplified by his well-publicized penchant for assisting car-wreck victims despite the advice of first responders that passersby should refrain from doing so unless the car is on fire.

Now that Cuomo is, like Rudy Giuliani post-9/11, the heroic face of government competence, he ought to exercise some humility himself. Wishing he had blown the bugle is a good start, but claiming he was unaware of the crisis as it was unfolding is simply passing the buck.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

It got so bad that even his allies and aides pushed for him to stop doing the briefings.

That led to an absolute meltdown, even by Trump standards, over the weekend.

We should root for more Twitter meltdowns, however embarrassing they are, because at least they don't endanger lives.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

President Donald Trump's Twitter meltdown over the weekend was more proof that the 45th president lacks impulse control and demonstrates at times frightening ignorance, but his online tirades are still preferable to some of his other recent communications.

The wild coronavirus briefings are getting worse

After a rare humiliation within his inner circle, the president skipped the daily coronavirus health briefings over the weekend, reportedly after being begged to dial back on the free wheeling media appearances by a number of his aides and allies.

The briefings, intended to inform the public on the federal government's response to the pandemic which has brought the country to the brink of an economic depression, have become fonts of conflicting information, self-pity, and self-congratulations — at least when Trump is at the microphone.

It's campaign season, and Trump is clearly itching to be on the road presiding over rallies before thousands of adoring followers. But that's not going to happen any time soon.

So he's used the briefings as his opportunity to attack his adversaries, brag about his administration's largely imaginary successes in fighting the virus, and generally stay front-and-center of media coverage, which is where he always needs to be.

But even for the most devoted Trumpists, there can be too much Trump.

The nadir of the Trump-corona Show was last Thursday, when Trump mused about the possible healing powers of injecting bleach into the human body.

The president told a national audience: ""I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute — one minute — and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside, or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs, and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it'd be interesting to check that. So you're going to have to use medical doctors with — but it sounds interesting to me.""

Though the usual Trump apologists in conservative media claimed he had been misquoted, Trump himself debunked that claim by saying he was being ""sarcastic.""

""I was asking a sarcastic, and a very sarcastic question to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside,"" Trump said Friday. ""But it does kill it, and it would kill it on the hands. That would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to the reporters.""

Jokes typically fail when they have to be explained (or when they lack punchlines). And Trump has a penchant for retroactively declaring something he said is ""a joke"" when it's too absurd for all but his most cynical supporters to defend.

After five years of the Trump Show, most of us are numb to his relentless self-promotion and attacks on anyone he deems his enemy. They're needless distractions during public health briefings, but they're not a threat to public health.

In contrast, his extemporaneous thought bubbles are genuine threats, as partially evidenced by the over 100 calls to Maryland's coronavirus hotline asking if the president's disinfectant cure was a good idea.

Twitter tirades are embarrassing, but they beat the alternative

The disinfectant fiasco was enough for Trump's inner circle to suggest a self-benching over the weekend.

Trump tweeted Saturday that the briefings intended to reassure the public during a time of historic crisis, but which he had instead used as free publicity, were ""Not worth the time & effort!!""

Without his daily platform to spread misinformation — intentional or otherwise — Trump took to Twitter and put on a master class in metaphorically declaring himself ""not owned,"" despite all evidence to the contrary. No one was spared. He not only went after the typically Trump-friendly Fox News, but also the generally pro-Trump Wall Street Journal editorial page.

He also went after the ""Noble Prize"" committee in a series of tweets for bestowing awards on reporters for their ""Russia, Russia, Russia"" coverage.

Most people fairly assumed he meant ""Nobel,"" which does not have a journalism award and hasn't given any awards to reporters who covered the Mueller investigation. For good measure, the free speech-loathing Trump called for ""all the great lawyers out there"" to join him in suing ""all, including the FAKE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS.""

He'd later delete these tweets, and again claim he was being sarcastic.

""Does anybody get the meaning of what a so-called Noble (not Nobel) Prize is, especially as it pertains to Reporters and Journalists? Noble is defined as, ""having or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals,"" the self-declared very stable genius tweeted.

Trump returned to his coronavirus briefing platform on Monday, limiting himself to such patently absurd statements as ""you would have been at war with North Korea if I wasn't president"" and boasting of ""the greatest economy in the history of the world"" before he had to deal with an actual crisis.

It's a shame, but hardly surprising, that Trump couldn't stay away from the briefings. His screaming Twitter tantrums are national embarrassments, but they do less damage than his politicized, fact-bereft coronavirus briefings.

Who knows if he'll again retreat to Twitter, or return to the daily spittle-fest that was ostensibly a public service, or some combination of the two. But for the health of the American people, it'd be better if he stayed away from the podium.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

SUMMARY: Republicans who just bailed out thousands of private companies and supported a vast increase in federal deficit-spending now want states to declare bankruptcy. Is that a smart idea? Can we save our cities when the pandemic ends, or will they now decline for decades? Biden needs to respond personally to the sexual-assault allegation.

Should states just ""declare bankruptcy?""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Donald Trump Drew Angerer/Getty Images

As states shell out billions of dollars on unemployment and other responses to the coronavirus—and as business shutdowns and payroll and sales tax declines whack tax revenue—state budgets are being blown apart.

New York State, for example, foresees at least a $10 billion to $15 billion budget shortfall this year.

To address this, many governors and economists are recommending that the federal government put emergency funding for the states into the next coronavirus response package. Some members of the GOP, however — including President Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Florida Sen. Rick Scott — have responded by saying that states should instead just ""declare bankruptcy.""

Is this a smart idea?

No.

Forcing states to declare bankruptcy right now would have the same effect as forcing dozens of giant airlines, hotel chains, and other companies to declare bankruptcy — namely, triggering millions of additional layoffs as states are forced to cut spending and, thereby, radically worsening the country's overall economic crisis.

The federal government has rightly chosen to extend lifelines to private companies hit by the crisis, and these bailouts have helped stabilize the economy. The GOP and White House helped design and pass these emergency funds to the private sector. So the suggestion that states should declare bankruptcy, when companies should not, stems mostly from political ideology rather than economic common sense.

Another argument put forth by the GOP — in particular, Florida Sen. Scott, himself a former governor — is that solvent states shouldn't have to bail out insolvent ones.

This argument sounds reasonable at first. Some states do have persistent fiscal challenges. And it is fine and reasonable for states that run tight ships to complain about having to support profligate neighbors. But the argument ignores the fact that some of the states that need help now normally subsidize the states that are now complaining.

An analysis by the Rockefeller Institute of Government found that, in fiscal 2018, 8 states sent more money to the federal government than they received back. The 42 other states, meanwhile, ran a deficit with the federal government, meaning that they received net subsidies.

In Rockefeller's chart below, the orange states—including New York—sent net money to Washington. All the others received it.

Given the deficit the federal government is running — an annual deficit that has ballooned to nearly $4 trillion in recent weeks with the passage of massive emergency spending plans approved by members of both parties — it's also hypocritical for national leaders to lecture state leaders about being fiscally responsible.

The federal government doesn't have to think about ""declaring bankruptcy,"" because we citizens have given it the power to print and borrow money. The federal government is supposed to use this power to help us, and it is.

The next important way the federal government can help us is to enable our state and local governments get through this crisis without having to cut services and fire millions of Americans.

Then, once the crisis is over, if the GOP still feels passionate about it, we can have a discussion about how and when states should subsidize each other. — HB

How to save our cities as the pandemic ends

Post-pandemic cities will be depressing places.

The disease is already undoing the density that's made downtowns so bustling, active, walkable, energy efficient, and rich. Post-pandemic, many who can afford to work and live remotely will likely shy away from the urban core.

The decline in workers, shoppers, and tourists will devastate the restaurant and retail economies. Theaters and art galleries will close. There will be a drop in new immigrants remaking neighborhoods and enriching urban culture.

It will suck.

There's almost universal agreement about how cities are likely to suffer. (Read these excellent stories if you want to feel really gloomy.) But there's less certainty about how they can recover.

The Atlantic's Derek Thompson notes that there's a natural boom-bust cycle in American cities: They get dense and rich, then empty out because of some unexpected societal upheaval (deindustrialization, urban unrest). This eventually lowers rents, which draws immigrants and cultural pioneers, and that in turn attracts money and more people, and the cities thrive again. If COVID-19 hollows out downtowns, they will eventually come back,

But ""eventually"" is a mighty long time — probably decades. That's not solace for city lovers today. Is there any way to speed up the post-pandemic cycle?

I think there is.

The post-pandemic city won't work until people feel safe, and for now, they won't feel safe without a transformation in the urban environment. Israel's an instructive example: After a spate of terrorist bombings 20 years ago, Israel began placing guards at the entrances to malls and markets. Israelis quickly felt safe shopping and gathering again. It was costly, but a lot cheaper than abandoning the markets.

Post-pandemic, American cities will need to make an even more sweeping physical transformation, and fast. Handwashing stations at every storefront; cleaning teams to wipe down surfaces; the spreading out of tables in restaurants and chairs in classrooms and seats in theaters; touchless pickup of groceries; touchless thermometer stations...the list goes on and on. And we don't yet know which of these changes will make people feel safe from infection (or actually make them be safe).

So here's a free idea for a billionaire tired of cocooning in a New Zealand bunker. Pick a single block in a city you love and fund every restaurant, apartment building, school, police station, day care, and office on that block to make themselves safe. Retrofit the restaurants to be less dense, and build a separate pickup entrance. Pay the daycare center to have a full-time cleaning person. Install handwashing stations in every classroom and office.

Create a model for a post-pandemic urban neighborhood, where people live and work together in the new way. If it works, it will quickly be copied in other neighborhoods and other cities, and cities will recover much faster. —DP

Pressure increases on Biden to personally address sexual-assault allegation

Yesterday, Insider published more corroboration of the 1993 sexual-assault allegation against former Vice President Biden.

Biden's campaign responded by pointing to its previous assertion that the allegation made by former staffer Tara Reade is false.

But there is now corroboration for this allegation, as there has been for similar allegations against other high-profile government figures, including Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and President Trump.

Kavanaugh directly responded to the allegations against him. President Trump has directly —and dismissively—responded to the many sexual assault allegations against him.

So Biden will likely have to respond himself to this one. And how he does so will be revealing.

Even as Democrats cringe at the idea that their leading hope to win back the White House has been hit with an allegation like this, they should want to hear what he has to say about it.

Will the allegation hurt Biden's chances of winning the Presidency? Or, like the plans of the latest corroborator of the allegation, Lynda LaCasse, will Democrats decide to vote for Biden? — HB

That's the longest stretch since 1957, and it is a rare bit of good pandemic news.

But is COVID-19 the universal crime fighter? The effect of the pandemic on crime is surprisingly erratic, and not yet clear. Murders are down in some places, but up in others. Property crime is surging in some cities, while drug crimes are down. Authorities expected a rise in domestic violence since people are cooped up at home, but are unsettled to find that some cities, including Los Angeles, are experiencing a drop in domestic violence calls, leading to fears that victims are afraid to call the police because they can't get away from their abusers. — DP

Blaming the victims of COVID-19

Last week the New York Times profiled a Fox-News-watching bar owner in Brooklyn who died after expressing skepticism about Covid-19. This week, the Washington Post took a turn: ""A Virginia preacher believed 'God can heal anything.' Then he caught coronavirus.""

In neither story was the victim the actual target: The purpose of the Times piece was to smack Fox News, especially Sean Hannity, for downplaying the disease. (Hannity is now threatening to sue the Times about it.) And the Post paints a subtle, sympathetic portrait of preacher Landon Spradlin, and criticizes others for mocking Spradlin. But the nut of the story was: Spradlin —""an avid Trump supporter"" posted something on Facebook about ""mass hysteria"" around the virus, then caught COVID-19 and died.

I don't get the point of these stories, which reduce rich, complicated lives to an ironic punchline. I also suspect they infuriate the very people they are intended to reach. — DP",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

SUMMARY: Yes, we'll waste billions and risk lives in a fast search for a coronavirus vaccine — but it's worth it. More corroboration for the Biden sexual-assault allegation. College presidents are right: Colleges need to open in the fall. Open the parks and beaches! Stop judging people who go outside! Biden to announce a ""committee"" to evaluate VP candidates? Come on!

Yes, let's waste billions of dollars — and even risk lives — in the search for a coronavirus vaccine. This is the best and fastest way to find one.

A lab technician working on samples from people to be tested for the new coronavirus at ""Fire Eye"" laboratory in Wuhan in China's central Hubei Province. Getty

Insider's Bill Bostock reports that the world's largest vaccine maker is going to manufacture 40 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate this summer, even though the vaccine hasn't been tested yet, might not be safe, or might not work. That's great news.

This is just one of what promise to be many apparently wasteful and risky attempts to create a vaccine — most of which will fail. Other pharma and biotech firms like Johnson & Johnson and Moderna are similarly ramping up vaccine manufacturing, before they know if the shots will work.

Bill Gates has proposed spending billions of dollars to build multiple vaccine-manufacturing plants to scale up production of seven different untested vaccines, though only one is likely to be effective. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is going to spend $2 billion to accelerate production of several vaccine candidates, most of which will likely go to waste.

Others propose to risk human lives to speed up vaccine testing. Some leading scientists want to launch ""human challenge"" trials for coronavirus vaccines. In these trials, volunteers would be given experimental vaccines or a placebo and then deliberately exposed to the coronavirus.

This would massively accelerate knowledge about whether the vaccine works, because we wouldn't have to wait months to see if the test subjects contract the disease in the normal course of life. But some of the volunteer subjects would also fall ill — especially if it's a placebo trial — and given how terrible COVID-19 is, some would likely die. This is also especially worrying in the current context because we have no effective treatment to help those who do get sick.

Wasting money and potentially harming people obviously aren't good. But, right now, the risks are worth it. That's because our enemy is time.

The normal processes of pharmaceutical research — manufacturing only when you know a drug works, and only testing in the safest ways — make sense in normal situations. But every day we don't have a vaccine, thousands die, billions of dollars in economic activity are lost, and human welfare declines. Our future selves become poorer and sicker.

So there is literally almost nothing we shouldn't try to get us a vaccine quicker, even if that means building factories that make vaccines that don't work and conducting potentially deadly trials on volunteers. —DP

More corroboration for the Biden sexual-assault allegation from the '90s

We now have more corroboration of the sexual-assault allegation against then-Sen. Biden in 1993.

Rich McHugh writes in Insider that a neighbor of Tara Reade, the former Biden staffer who recently filed a criminal complaint accusing him of assaulting her in a hallway, has come forward to corroborate her story.

The neighbor, Lynda LaCasse, says Reade told her about the alleged incident in 1995 or 1996, a few years after Reade says it occurred. LaCasse said Reade shared with her many of the same details that Reade has recently alleged.

LaCasse says Reade did not ask her to come forward now. She adds that she is a Democrat and plans to vote for Biden. She says she came forward because she believes it was the right thing to do.

A second corroborator, Lorraine Sanchez, was a colleague of Reade's in a California state senator's office after she left Washington DC. Sanchez says Reade told her that her former boss in Washington had harassed her. Sanchez did not recall whether Reade went into detail.

Biden's campaign has said Reade's allegation is false. Biden himself has not commented on it. He's going to have to.

College presidents are right: Colleges need to open in the fall

The Purdue marching band. Chris T Pehlivan / Shutterstock.com

Crowded parties, football stadiums, dorms, lecture halls … colleges are paradise for a zealous coronavirus, which is why they all shut down, and fast, in March. But most universities and colleges can't afford to stay closed for long. They carry huge faculty and staff costs, and own expensive physical plants.

Colleges also depend on tuition to pay their bills. And most can't simply transition to remote learning, because students won't stand for it. They're paying for the college experience, for working together in labs and studios, living together in dorms.

So it's expected — and encouraging — that we're now seeing a rush of college presidents pushing bold ideas about how to reopen in the fall, even without a coronavirus vaccine or treatment.

In an inspiring letter, president Mitch Daniels said Purdue University is ""determined not to surrender helplessly to those [COVID-19] difficulties but to tackle and manage them aggressively and creatively."" Daniels argues that the virus is not an intolerable risk for the young. He proposes to test everyone in August, reopen campus for those under 35 years old, segregate those older than 35 or at particular risk from the general population, and track and contact trace the infected.

Will it work? Who knows? But it's heartening to see this kind of practical problem-solving from one of the world's greatest engineering schools. We're not going to learn how to live with the virus without some creative, even unorthodox thinking, and it makes sense to use universities — which are the front lines of American research, after all — as laboratories.

For example, Brown University president Christina Paxson acknowledges that reopening colleges will almost certainly require using technology that infringes on civil liberties to vigorously track students and faculty. That seems like an infringement worth a test, and no better place to try it out than in the limited space of a campus.

What Purdue president Daniels doesn't say is that the decision by some schools to reopen will put pressure on other schools, since no college will want to risk losing its students to rivals that have reopened. But not every college will have the resources to test and track in the way Purdue or Brown can, so there will definitely be campus COVID-19 clusters in the fall. —DP

Open the parks and beaches! Stop judging people who go outside!

As pressure builds for lockdowns to be relaxed or dropped, it's time to get more sophisticated about which measures actually have a big effect on slowing the coronavirus and which don't.

Concentrating our efforts on measures that really matter, while giving us more freedom by relaxing those that don't, will enable us to keep the crucial tactics in place for longer.

So here's a suggestion:

Relax restrictions that encourage or compel people to stay indoors.

The virus spreads primarily by droplets getting from one infected person's nose and mouth to another person's, in sufficient quantities and duration to cause an infection. Sunlight kills the virus quickly, and wind disperses it. Studies suggest that transmission almost exclusively occurs indoors.

As Insider's Anna Medaris Miller explains, experts are confident that being outside is low risk, especially when you are properly distanced. When you're distanced and wearing a mask, in fact, it would take something amounting to a ""freak accident"" for you to catch the virus or infect someone else outside, even if you passed close by each other.

A new study from China underscores this. It looked at 318 ""outbreaks"" that involved three or more cases. Not a single one of these infections occurred outdoors. (Most of them occurred within homes, with one family member infecting others. It has another important implication for more sophisticated distancing measures — namely, creating isolation and quarantine facilities outside of homes — but we'll leave that for another day.)

In a broader look at 7,324 cases, in fact, the researchers found only one case in which infection appears to have occurred outdoors. It involved two people in a village who had a conversation after one of them returned from a visit to Wuhan.

To be clear: It's not impossible to catch or transmit the virus outside. But it's rare. And with minimal precautions — some distancing and a mask — it should be extremely rare.

Meanwhile, going outside has all sorts of psychological and physiological benefits, including allowing us to feel more free and less trapped. As Anna Medaris Miller posits, even experts who fully support distancing measures believe that these benefits offset the risks. Respected Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch — who generally supports strict distancing measures — believes there is a net benefit to keeping open spaces open.

So open the parks!

And go outside! —HB

Everyone's eager to know who VP Biden will choose as his running mate.

Instead of just making the decision and then telling us the answer, however, Biden reportedly plans to first announce the selection of a ""committee"" who will evaluate the candidates.

Yes, the Trump habit of dismissing experts and making impulsive decisions with minimal consideration based on his own ""gut instinct"" leads to imprecision and mistakes. And, yes, the country is suffering for this.

But announcing a committee to evaluate potential VP candidates is going too far the other way.

Of course Biden should have a team evaluate prospective candidates. But he doesn't need to announce in advance who these people are. He also doesn't need to remind Americans that Democrats have a reputation for being overly bureaucratic in their decision-making. —HB",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

The unofficial start of summer is just over a week away!

But unfortunately, summer is canceled. Not to mention, the window to take advantage of cheap gas for your road trip is closing fast.

In Wisconsin — where gas was as low as 87 cents just weeks ago — the bottom is now up to a whopping $1.44. Who can even afford that?

Rising gas prices are just one sign that oil markets are starting to recover, in step with global oil demand. That's great news for an industry that faced one of the worst springs in history.

Now we're starting to ask: What will the energy industry look like when the pandemic is in the rearview?

For starters, we asked a bunch of CEOs.

We had the pleasure of interviewing eight top energy execs — from BP's Susan Dio to Duke Energy's Lynn Good — about how the coronavirus will change their companies and the industry at large.

Theme 1: The transition to low-carbon energy remains at center stage even as majors slash their budgets. 2020 forecasts aside, the pandemic won't do much to slow it down.

Theme 2: People are craving energy resilience, especially as wildfire and hurricane seasons draw near. That could give residential solar and infrastructure projects a boost.

Here are a few of the comments that stood out to me. You can read all of them here.

""California had one of the driest months of February in its history, and because of COVID-19, we've seen reports of fewer prescribed burns, which increases the risk of wildfires this fall,"" Sunrun's CEO Lynn Jurich said.

""We have a wire or a pipe connected to businesses in every county of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan,"" CMS Energy's CEO Patti Poppe said. ""The question for us in the midterm is how will those businesses come back.""

""We are a little bit worried about the electrification of transportation right now because I think the transportation sector is suffering a lot,"" Energy Impact Partners' CEO Hans Kobler said. ""Electric vehicle sales will be down 40%.""

I don't know what I'm eating for lunch or where I'll be living in two months, let alone what the world will look like in 20 years.

But if anyone is up for the task of predicting the future of energy, it's analysts at the research firm Wood Mackenzie. This week, they sketched out three paths that a recovery could take, and what each means for energy.

""Full recovery"": A coronavirus vaccine becomes available next year, and governments around the world pour money into spurring economic growth.

Oil demand returns to pre-pandemic levels of around 100 million barrels per day (bpd) in the 2020s and then reaches a peak of more than 110 million bpd by the mid-2030s.

Natural gas and cheap renewable energy sources would slowly replace coal, causing it to decline slightly by 2040.

""Go it alone"": The virus is tough to defeat, trade and travel are restricted, and the world suffers from a long recession.

Global demand for oil increases very little after an initial rebound.

""By 2030 it is barely any higher than was expected for 2020 if the pandemic had not hit,"" they said.

""Greener growth"": A short recession is followed by a strong rebound that includes government support for low-carbon energy.

Oil demand wouldn't move much for the next decade or so and then decline steeply in the 2030s.

Most remarkably, ""the combined share of oil, gas, and coal in total primary energy drops to 68% in 2040, down from 84% in 2019,"" the analysts said.

Oil prices have rallied in recent weeks, but the US shale industry — once synonymous with American energy dominance — is not exactly celebrating.

As we reported earlier this week, its problems began well before the coronavirus pandemic took root.

History lesson: In the last five years, US shale companies have failed to deliver investor returns and accrued billions of dollars of debt.

Investors made a lot of money when they invested on ""the dip"" around 2009, when oil prices were low.

Those investors helped fuel the fracking revolution of the 2010s, which supercharged America's oil output.

An unintended consequence was that fracking brought M&A — the main source of capital gains for investors — to a near standstill over the following years. (I explain why here.)

So when investors once again backed US shale in the last downturn, beginning around 2014, they never saw returns.

Where we are now: Of the 500 or so US oil and gas companies backed by private equity, about 400 of them don't have bids, according to an investor who's been tracking the industry for years.

That means they'll be forced to go into what he called ""blowdown"" — diverting cash from production to investors, causing oil output to decline over time.

US production could fall by as much as 4 million barrels of oil per day by the end of next year, the investor said.

Where we are headed: ""What you're seeing is the rapid shrinkage of the industry,"" he said. ""A lot of companies are going to cease to exist.""

Exchanges' physical trading floors have drawn attention during the coronavirus due to the close proximity in which brokers need to work with one another. NYSE temporarily closed its iconic trading floor starting on March 23.

Some have suggested exchanges might choose to remain closed forever, with others saying the markets have operated perfectly fine without them being open. However, NYSE has remained adamant that it would eventually reopen its floor.

Some critical components of NYSE, such as the designated market makers, have adapted to function without the trading floor. However, on Thursday NYSE president Stacey Cunningham announced that the exchange would slowly begin to open its trading floor starting on May 26.

As for Tuchman, he said he hopes to return.

""Hope to be back on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange ASAP,"" he said. ""The moment it is safe and sound to protect the community: the brokers, the market makers, everybody down there.""",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

US industrial production slid in April by the most since data collection began in 1919 as coronavirus lockdowns slammed manufacturing activity.

Manufacturing output plunged a record 13.7% ""as all major industries posted decreases,"" the Federal Reserve said in a Friday release. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected a 14.6% drop.

Total production dipped 11.2% after its 4.5% contraction in March. Automobile and auto parts manufacturing plummeted more than 70%, the biggest industry-group decline in the Fed's index.

Capacity utilization, a metric that tracks the amount of a factory being used, declined 8.3 percentage points to 64.9 last month. The rate sits 14.9 percentage points below its average from 1972 to 2019, and slightly below its last all-time low seen during the financial crisis.

Even as the US pivots to economic reopening plans, factories are unlikely to see the smooth recovery hoped for in other sectors. Manufacturing activity declined relatively early in the pandemic's life, as supply chain disruptions slowed production before outbreaks cropped up in the US.

Weakened demand, lasting uncertainty, and fiscal tightening will delay a return to past levels of output by more than a year, Gregory Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said Friday.

""The coronavirus causes the gears of industrial activity to grind to a halt,"" he wrote in an emailed note. ""We forecast that industrial output losses will not be recovered until late-2021.""

The bleak industrial data joins several other reports detailing the economic damage sourced from the coronavirus pandemic. Weekly jobless claims reached 3 million last week, the Labor Department announced Thursday, bringing the metric's eight-week total to more than 36 million Americans.

US consumer sentiment rose in May as coronavirus relief helped American households in the short term.

The University of Michigan's consumer-sentiment index gained to 73.7 in May from 71.8 in April according to preliminary data released Friday. The increase was led by a nearly 10-point jump in the current economic conditions index, to 83 in May from 74.3 in April.

The report is the latest to show the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and sweeping lockdowns to curb the disease on the US economy. While some states are slowly starting to reopen, sparking hope that a recovery will soon be underway, dismal data continues to pour in — US retail sales for April fell 16.4%, the second month in a row of a record slump, according to data released Friday.

The Friday survey so far indicates consumers do not feel good about their future prospects. The index of consumer expectations fell to 67.7 from 70.1 in April, and personal financial prospects for the year ahead fell to the lowest level in almost six years, according to the report.

The April data shows a fuller extent of government shutdowns designed to contain the coronavirus, compared to the partial impact seen in March. Consumers slowed their spending even further as job losses persisted, sending the unemployment rate to highs not seen since the Great Depression.

Spending decreased in all but one major category: nonstore retailers. The group, which includes Amazon, saw an 8.4% jump for the month. On the flip side, a 78.8% drop at clothing stores led declines, following by a 60.6% decline in electronics and appliances stores.

Food and beverages stores fell 13.1% in April, following a 25.6% jump in March as consumer stocked up. Food services and drinking places also slumped 29.5% during the month.

The plunge has invigorated fears that US gross domestic product will experience a sharp drop in the second quarter. Retail sales account for more than 40% of consumer spending, which in turn is around 70% of US GDP.

The second is that it put Connecticut at the top of the chart — the Thursday number was the highest in the nation, beating out other larger states such as New York, California, and Pennsylvania.

""Another round of checks for illegal immigrants. Can you believe it?"" the Kentucky Republican said during a speech on the Senate floor.

The Democratic plan opens the door for more immigrants to get federal cash by extending eligibility to those with Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers instead of a Social Security number.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell assailed the $3 trillion spending package from House Democrats on Thursday. He expressed ire in particular at a provision extending eligibility for stimulus checks to immigrants who were left out of the initial wave of federal payments.

During a speech on the Senate floor, McConnell said the move would benefit undocumented people in the US.

""Another round of checks for illegal immigrants. Can you believe it?"" the Kentucky Republican said. ""We forgot to have the Treasury Department send money to people here illegally. My goodness, what an oversight. Thank goodness Democrats are on the case.""

He also took a swipe against a measure within the bill to temporarily suspend a cap on the amount of state and local taxes that could be deducted from federal income taxes, which would benefit mostly high-income taxpayers living in highly-taxed states.

McConnell's comments illustrate the fierce GOP opposition to the Democratic plan. Republicans already declared it dead-on-arrival in the Senate, as they've expressed alarm over the ballooning federal deficit.

Under the CARES Act approved in March, nearly 150 million Americans qualified for $1,200 stimulus checks with an extra $500 per child — as long as they had a valid Social Security number. The requirement shut out undocumented immigrants from receiving the cash, a similar step taken when the Bush administration approved a round of direct payments in early 2008.

Up to 15.4 million people in mixed-status families were excluded from receiving the stimulus checks, according to the Migration Policy Institute. That figure includes 1.2 million American citizens married to undocumented immigrants.

The new Democratic plan would send $1,200 federal checks to Americans — including children — and limit the maximum amount a household can receive at $6,000. But instead of a Social Security number, recipients only need an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, which opens the door for immigrants already paying taxes to get the payments.

Republican support for another round of stimulus checks is slim at the moment. It's a stark contrast to the swelling number of Democratic lawmakers supporting recurring payments to tide over people through the pandemic as unemployment rises to staggering levels unseen since the Great Depression.

It's not immediately clear that a deal will be struck among lawmakers to include stimulus checks in the next coronavirus relief package and it's up in the air whether compromise is possible.

Rep. Kevin Brady, the top GOP lawmaker on the House Ways and Means Committee, threw cold water on the idea of backing more direct payments, The Washington Post reported.

The millions of Americans who have lost their jobs in recent weeks are disproportionately lower-income workers, according to a new survey from the Federal Reserve.

Nearly 40% of people working in February with a household income below $40,000 reported that they'd lost a job in March, the survey released Thursday showed. While most of the survey focused on economic well-being at the end of 2019, supplemental questions were added in early April as the coronavirus pandemic hit the US.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell had pointed out this statistic a day earlier in a presentation at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

""This reversal of economic fortune has caused a level of pain that is hard to capture in words, as lives are upended amid great uncertainty about the future,"" he said.

The Fed survey comes the same day that the Labor Department reported that 2.98 million Americans filed for unemployment insurance last week, bringing the eight-week total to 36.5 million claims as the coronavirus pandemic continues to slam the labor market.

Last week's April jobs report showed that 20.5 million jobs were erased in the month, and that the unemployment rate spiked to 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression. While almost no sector was immune to job losses, they were most concentrated in leisure and hospitality.

1. Which investments would you call under-the-radar opportunities right now?

Many investors, whether they are pension funds or retirees, need income.

And bonds, which used to be the cornerstone of an income-generating portfolio, just aren't delivering unless you venture out on the risk spectrum.

One can generate a much higher level of income today from a portfolio on high-quality dividend paying stocks. And unlike bond coupons, dividends from stocks can grow over time.

2. What is your most contrarian, or surprising, market call in this environment?

We are seeing pressure on companies to halt buybacks and dividend payments, and some will be forced to do just that, especially if they benefit from government assistance.

But dividends are an important part of thoughtful capital allocation. If a company has excess cash that it has no place to invest for a return above its cost of capital, it's prudent to return that capital to shareholders. Otherwise, they are destroying value.

Our view is that well-managed companies will not abandon sound capital allocation policies. While they may temporarily suspend buybacks, those with strong balance sheets and ongoing cash flows will continue paying dividends.

3. Name one stock or investment you're most bullish on right now.

Our approach is not to find some rare gem with undiscovered value. We look for a diversified group of stocks where we have a high degree of confidence they will pay and grow dividends.

Here's one of them: Watsco, the largest distributor of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies in North America. It has a history of returning cash to shareholders, having paid a quarterly dividend since 2009.

They are also making significant investments in technology. A lot of companies are talking about ecommerce and mobile apps; however, most investors don't associate technology with HVAC equipment distributors.

4. What is one risk within the market you feel investors are missing?

In a time like this, active management is essential for an income-oriented equity portfolio.

Companies that have been buying back shares and paying dividends while piling up debt are in for a rough period. For a portfolio to provide sustained income, companies need to be vetted for the ability to pay dividends that are covered by sustainable and growing cash flows, and for shareholder-friendly management.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

During a recent webcast, O'Keefe discussed two stock picks he finds attractive in light of the market turmoil.

Southwest Airlines' strong balance sheet gives the carrier an edge over its peers, while UBS is better exposed to high-quality credit, he said.

Market crashes are no fun for the fund managers whose holdings shrink in value.

But for value investors specifically, every one of these episodes is an opportunity to find downtrodden companies that become much cheaper compared with their long-term prospects.

This is yet another reason that stock pickers like Daniel O'Keefe prefer their approach over the alternative that buys index and exchange-traded funds.

The Artisan International Value Fund he comanages looks for stocks the market is underpricing relative to their intrinsic or cash-flow-derived value. It has returned more than 6% over the past 15 years, double the performance of its category, according to Morningstar data.

In light of the coronavirus crisis and its impact on market valuations, O'Keefe singled out three of his holdings that have attractive value propositions.

For starters, he is not giving up on US airlines even after Warren Buffett, a godfather of value investing, liquidated his stake in the battered industry.

O'Keefe's fund first bought Southwest Airlines in the first quarter as the pandemic halted most travel. And as an indication of the low-cost carrier's ascendancy, its stock has held up better than every other US airline this year even though it is down 55%.

O'Keefe said one characteristic that should give Southwest an edge going forward is its balance sheet, which includes nearly $4 billion in cash.

""They have the enormous financial resources to survive what I think most people would agree is a temporary and anomalous situation,"" he said during a recent webcast hosted by Ariel Investments.

The airline's other advantages include its exclusively domestic itineraries and extensive network of low-cost flights, he added.

Not every airline with these characteristics may be able to survive the crisis. O'Keefe pointed to Boeing CEO David Calhoun' prediction that a major US airline could go bust this year amid the coronavirus pandemic.

""That will be of enormous benefit to Southwest,"" O'Keefe said, adding, ""They are in the best position to take market share when the others are clearly impaired.""

The second distinctive opportunity he identified is across the pond and in a completely different industry. UBS was the sixth-largest holding in his global value portfolio as of March 31.

He views it as a cheap stock that has undeservedly been painted with the same brush as the rest of the European banking industry.

""It's a wealth-management business,"" O'Keefe said. ""Yes, it has the investment bank. But it's a fairly de-risked investment bank over the last 10 years.""

He added that UBS as a whole did not have as much low-credit exposure as some of its peers. The majority of its credit exposure is to wealthy clients and includes so-called Lombard loans that are secured against a portfolio of liquid assets.

""If you don't want to own a bank, but you want to benefit from the undervaluation of banks, something like UBS is really interesting,"" O'Keefe said.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

He credits those triumphs to an approach based on critical businesses and technologies, as well as innovation and the avoidance of highly levered companies. Along the way he's made some prescient market calls.

Ahlsten told Business Insider about three big purchases and three sales he made during the downturn as he reacted to the crash and prepared for a recovery.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

If you were picking a fund manager to rebuild your portfolio after it was demolished by the coronavirus, Todd Ahlsten would have a strong resume to show you.

Ahlsten took cover as manager of the Parnassus Core Equity Fund in April 2001, after the dot-com bubble burst and as a recession began. By underweighting tech stocks and avoiding companies with questionable business models that weren't likely to bounce back, he crushed the market in 2001 and 2002.

Just a few years later, in 2005, he concluded that a bubble was forming in the housing market and sold the fund's investments in the sector. That helped him position himself defensively for the market's steep downturn a few years later, and he beat the market from 2007-09 as well.

And when the coronavirus crash hit, his strategy still worked.

""The playbook of avoiding leverage, avoiding low quality companies, investing in companies with longterm sustainable demand and innovation drove performance,"" he told Business Insider. Kiplinger says the fund's annual return of 8.7% over the 20-year span that ended March 31 is surpassed by only five others.

A major component of his approach involves buying companies that look like they're going to be ""relevant"" for years and years and will improve when downturns end. In an exclusive interview, Ahlsten explained how he's applied that strategy to a radically altered market, giving details on three major buys and three sales.

The new additions

Ahlsten quickly made Amazon one of his biggest positions when the market was near its recent lows. Before that, he'd had concerns about both the stock price and Amazon's approach to renewable energy and to worker pay.

""We looked at the growth of Amazon Web Services, and they're really going to emerge in a very dominant way,"" he said. ""We do take ESG factors into account and we were looking for some improvement on how they think about the environment and workplace.""

Ahlsten says he paid around $1,700 for the stock, so it's already returned 38.5% and was the biggest contributor to the fund's performance in the first quarter. But he's not eyeing the exits.

""We think it's going to have a very long, dominant future,"" he said.

Also joining the ranks was Adobe, a popular tech stock that had suffered a sharp crash.

""I think we bought it at 26 times earnings. That was a five-year low on the multiple,"" he said. ""We really found opportunity to buy this company that generates phenomenal free cash flow, over 40% operating margins that can expand. ... We really think they're in a great position.""

That's worked out so far, as the stock has rallied 25% from its mid-March low.

Lastly, Ahlsten doubled the fund's stake in Alphabet, which nosedived about 30% as investors wondered if its advertising revenue was going to crater. Having owned the stock since early 2007, he was comfortable betting on a comeback.

""We think search and their assets will be even more important,"" he said. ""They can invest in autonomous driving. While some people are pulling back, Google will continue to invest.""

Alphabet stock is up more than 15% in the current quarter, which almost doubles the gain made by the S&P 500.

Ahlsten also parted with the fund's two worst performers during the quarter because their businesses have been upended by the pandemic and recovery looks far away.

The illness, called ""multi-system inflammatory syndrome,"" is similar to toxic shock syndrome, requires intensive care and is sometimes fatal.

Symptoms include a rash, heart problems, problems with blood coagulation, or acute vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has released a medical brief warning doctors about a newly-recognized condition linked to the coronavirus that affects children and adolescents.

Known as ""multisystem inflammatory syndrome,"" the illness has reportedly caused organ failure and shock in children and adolescents and testing suggests it's related to COVID-19.

Preliminary case reports have defined the illness in those aged 0-19 who may have been exposed to coronavirus. Symptoms include rash, high fever for more than 3 days, fatigue and confusion, vomiting, stomach pain, and/or diarrhea.

Other researchers have proposed the name ""Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporarily Associated with SARS-CoV-2,"" or PIMS-TS for short, to describe the new condition.

Medical workers are urged to submit any relevant case data online to help doctors and researchers better identify and understand the illness, determine what causes it, and develop treatments.

The brief, released May 15, follows a similar announcement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also calling for medical workers to report any symptoms of the inflammatory syndrome to help add to the limited data available.

The WHO has also noted that symptoms of this newly-identified syndrome are similar to Kawasaki disease, a rare disease that affects children under 5 years old, causing inflammation in the arterial walls.

Although much is still unknown about the syndrome, it's still believed to be rare even in children exposed to coronavirus — at least 100 children worldwide have been recently been diagnosed with the illness, Business Insider previously reported.

In New York City, 38 children have been diagnosed with PIMS-TS and three have died.

It's unclear if this particular illness also affects adults.

In addition to the five sailors who were removed after testing positive, another 18 sailors were also taken off the ship because they had been in close contact.

Five US Navy sailors who were cleared to return to the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt after two negative tests have tested positive for COVID-19, a defense official told Insider Thursday.

All five of the sailors have been removed from the ship, as have 18 other sailors who were in close contact with them.

The sailors, a defense official explained, had previously tested positive for the virus and were removed from the ship and placed in isolation on Guam. All five sailors completed the mandatory 14-day quarantine and tested negative twice before they were allowed to return to the ship.

The outbreak aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt began in late March with only a few cases. As of April 30, there were 1,102 cases among sailors assigned to the ship.

The virus upended the carrier's Pacific deployment, forcing it into port in Guam, where it has remained for over a month as the Navy works to get the situation under control.

Over 80% of the carrier's crew of roughly 4,800 sailors were evacuated ashore and placed in isolation in hotels and other facilities.

In recent weeks, sailors have begun returning to the ship, but only on the condition that they meet the health requirements.

""You have to go through two different checks plus being COVID tested twice,"" Capt. Carlos Sardiello, commanding officer of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, told CBS News earlier this month. ""We sideline sailors for the slightest thing. Sniffles.""

But there are some challenges.

The New York Times reported Thursday that one sailor hid a loss of smell, a key symptom of COVID-19, from medical examiners for days after returning to the ship.

In response, a sailor in the medical department sent out a message begging crewmembers to be honest. ""Please stress the importance of being truthful so we don't potentially have Covid+ aboard this ship,"" the email reportedly read.

The Revolutionary Guard has pushed for the under-reporting of coronavirus cases in the country, and a relaxation of the lockdown.

That triggered a resurgence of infections in April, sources tell Insider.

The Revolutionary Guard has also recently bungled a missile test that killed 19 sailors and accidentally shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet.

The Rouhani government thus sees an opening to take more control of the situation.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Iran's elected government under President Hassan Rouhani is embroiled in an internal power struggle against hardline factions of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for control of the country's response to the COVID-19 crisis.

The struggle has been exacerbated by two military disasters this year: January's accidental shootdown of a Ukrainian jetliner over Tehran, which killed 176 people; and last Sunday's failed naval missile test that accidentally killed at least 19 Iranian sailors and left more than a dozen still missing.

Iran was the second nation after China to suffer a major outbreak of COVID-19. The disease ripped through top officials and health care workers in the holy city of Qom before spreading to the rest of the nation. But despite social media posts publicising the widespread deaths and a collapsed healthcare system dating back to February, official reports have put Iran's total infection counts at just 114,533 cases as of May 14, with 6,854 dead.

Insider's sources say those numbers greatly downplay the extent of Iran's COVID problem.

'Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guard have been downplaying the extent of the COVID problem since the initial outbreak hit their guys hard in Qom'

""[The Supreme Leader Ali] Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guard have been downplaying the extent of the COVID problem since the initial outbreak hit their guys hard in Qom at the start of the outbreak,"" said a regional intelligence official in the Middle East who does not have permission to speak about a top military rival.

""Rouhani's government has tried to take control of the situation and use the extensive health ministry networks that it controls to reduce the outbreak. But our intelligence indicated that reports about a struggle between the elected officials and the unelected structures controlled by Khamenei.""

Before the crisis, Iran was already under economic pressure from harsh sanctions enforced by the United States intended to deter its development of nuclear weapons. The partial nationwide shutdown combined to prevent the spread of coronavirus exacerbated the situation. Our source says that national security officials linked to Khamenei reportedly forced the government to ease restrictions — and that generated an uptick in infections across the country in April. The news was suppressed in international reporting.

'The numbers the Iranians have put out since late April are considered extremely suspect'

""Any of the numbers the Iranians have put out since late April are considered extremely suspect because we have indications that the Revolutionary Guard — which means this comes from Khamenei's office directly — are not reporting cases from its health and military infrastructure and possibly intimidating reporting from other areas as well because the leadership has decided this is a national security issue, where too many cases will make Iran look inept and weak in the face of American pressure,"" one source told Insider.

The Iranian economy, which had been battered by sanctions, is expected to collapse further during the COVID epidemic. The last two years has seen Iran's currency lose more than 60% of its value and a rise 37% in consumer prices this year alone. At the same time, historically low oil prices in 2020 have reduced Iranian revenue.

An oil industry analyst based in the UAE — who asked not to be identified discussing matters that affect clients' oil revenues — said that Iran's elected government is hurt worse by the collapse of the oil prices than the Revolutionary Guard. The Revolutionary Guard maintains its own parallel government and economy in Iran. The government, by contrast, relies on traditional taxation and revenue budgeting processes, which are dependent on the health of the oil market. The Revolutionary Guard, said the source, has far more flexibility to raise and spend money through non-traditional means.

""The Guard has always maintained its own cash flow from oil skimmed off the national production, through sweetheart contracts, and company ownership deals, and through off-the-books trade both in and out of Iran. And that's before the direct support it gets from religious institutions and charities directly controlled by the supreme leader,"" said the source. ""Rouhani is forced to try to wrest political control over the Iranian system from a system designed to operate outside of that system. It's not easy.""

A 2013 investigation by Reuters estimated that Khamenei controlled assets in the tens of billions of dollars from a complex web of religious institutions, corporate investment and asset seizures. The result is that the Revolutionary Guard is a quasi-independent military and economic center of power of its own.

""He's got the type of money on hand to compete with a nation-state - the only other person with personal access to this much cash is probably Putin,"" said a financial intelligence analyst with a NATO member's intelligence service. ""Khamenei funds an independent parallel state that directly competes with Rouhani.""

The Guard's ineptitude has provided an opening for the government

The elected government — which controls ministries and the official armed forces and intelligence services of the Iranian state — has a financial and security disadvantage, by comparison.

But multiple sources said January's inept shootdown of the Ukrainian jet, plus last week's botched naval missile test that struck a naval vessel instead of the target it was towing, has given Rouhani some leverage to pressure the government response to COVID.

""They have refused to say if the missile test last Sunday was the IRGC or the proper Iranian Navy, but it's assumed that a high-profile test of a high tech weapon system in plain view of all their enemies in the Gulf would have only been a Revolutionary Guard production. But the incident as well as the tragedy in January with the airliner has given Rouhani a legitimate claim that the Guard is failing at both its international responsibilities with these failures as well as poorly responding to COVID,"" said the regional intelligence source.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

""China's efforts to target these sectors pose a significant threat to our nation's response to COVID-19,"" the agencies said. ""The potential theft of this information jeopardizes the delivery of secure, effective, and efficient treatment options.""

Wednesday's announcement was issued to raise awareness among healthcare, pharmaceutical, and research operations that might be targeted. The FBI and the CISA suggested that at-risk organizations ""maintain dedicated cybersecurity and insider threat practices,"" such as patching critical vulnerabilities, actively scanning for unauthorized access, and strengthening authentication processes.

Last week, US and UK security agencies issued a joint statement warning of cybersecurity threats to the operations of organizations involved in responding to the coronavirus, saying that unnamed actors were targeting ""national and international healthcare bodies, pharmaceutical companies, research organizations, and local government with the likely aim of gathering information related to the coronavirus outbreak.""

The warning issued Wednesday was more specific, calling attention to suspected Chinese activity in the networks of related organizations.

The Chinese government has denied involvement in such cyberattacks on US organizations.

""China is a staunch upholder of cybersecurity and a victim to cyberattacks,"" a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said this week. ""We firmly oppose and fight all kinds of cyberattacks conducted by hackers.""

The military has the authority to treat troops with drugs approved for other conditions or with newly developed drugs, which presents a legal challenge due to existing laws protecting military personnel by recognizing that their obligation to follow orders reduces their ability to provide informed consent.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Infectious disease has always been one of the military's greatest threats. By its own estimates, the US Army lost almost as many soldiers from the 1918 flu as died on the battlefields of the first World War.

Troops are at risk during an outbreak due to the tight quarters in which they live and work. It is therefore not surprising that all branches of the service — Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force and Coast Guard — have been hit hard by COVID-19.

The military has also played an important role in responding to the virus, from evacuating State Department officials from Wuhan in January to its current role building and staffing civilian field hospitals and augmenting civilian research teams.

To mitigate any risk, the Department of Defense has enforced rigorous social distancing policies and a military-wide travel ban halting nonessential deployments.

New treatments

But in addition to measures aimed at keeping people away from sources of infection, the military is also treating active-duty personnel who become infected. Because the COVID-19 virus is new, there are as yet no FDA approved treatments.

As a result, military physicians are turning to either treatments approved for other conditions or seeking access to newly developed treatments, such as the antiviral Remdesivir, which to date has received FDA emergency use approval only for COVID-19 patients with severe conditions. That presents a significant legal challenge due to existing laws protecting military personnel by recognizing that their obligation to follow orders reduces their ability to provide informed consent.

As an expert in public health law and human subject research, I study the tension between protecting participants of biomedical research and responding quickly to emerging threats. But I have also had personal experience with the events that led to the passing of the law that allows the military to work with the FDA in order to get emergency authorization to respond quickly to emerging threats.

Gulf War syndrome

In 1998, I was working for now US Senator, then Connecticut Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal when I met Russ Dingle and Thomas ""Buzz"" Rempfer, two remarkable airmen who filed a whistleblower complaint seeking protection from what they described as forced participation in an unlawful research experiment.

Specifically, they asserted that the Department of Defense was mandating that all active duty personnel be vaccinated against anthrax using a product, AVA, not yet approved by the FDA for the purpose the Army was now using it.

The vaccine had been in use since the 1970s to protect wool workers and veterinarians at risk from touching naturally occurring anthrax spores, but had not been approved for protection against inhaling them, a method of spread reportedly developed by Iraqi scientists as a bioweapon.

But many in the military were reluctant to be vaccinated because of their concern that it might be a cause of Gulf War Syndrome. To this day, there is no agreement about the specific symptoms, let alone cause, of Gulf War Syndrome.

A 2000 report by the well-respected Institute of Medicine found ""no conclusive link to the vaccine."" But the causal connection seemed plausible to many sufferers, especially given the continuing emergence of long-term harm suffered by veterans of the Vietnam War and their children from exposure to Agent Orange.

The whistleblower's primary claim was that the anthrax vaccination program was ""research"" and therefore the army was required to abide by two different protections. The first, called the Common Rule, is a law establishing that all research conducted by the federal government require the informed consent of participants.

Their second claim was that even if it was being used as a preventative measure, the Department of Defense was constrained by a 1998 law passed in direct response to concerns over possible links between unapproved drugs and Gulf War Syndrome. It prohibited ""the administration of investigational new drugs, or drugs unapproved for their intended use, to service members without their informed consent"" unless consent was waived by the president.

Blumenthal wrote to the secretary of defense warning him that administering an unapproved vaccine risked violating both laws and demanding that the research be stopped. That letter became part of a larger debate over whether the military's need for force protection exceeded the risks to any individual serviceperson.

Emergency use

Teams of FBI agents and scientists entered the quarantined former headquarters of The National Enquirer for a second day Saturday, scouring the building for clues in the anthrax attack. Steve Mitchell/AP

In 2003, Col. Rempfer and six other at first unnamed plaintiffs brought suit in federal court which resulted in a preliminary injunction halting the vaccine program.

Responding to the lawsuit, the Department of Defense denied that they were conducting research and claimed the authority to waive consent because it was necessary to prevent infection with weaponized anthrax.

But in winning the battle, those seeking to stop the vaccine program lost the war. The Department of Defense appealed to Congress for a workaround. It resulted in the passing of the BioShield Act in 2004, creating the Emergency Use Authorization.

This gave the FDA authority to recharacterize the status of a drug or vaccine from investigational to approved for emergency use. In December of 2005 it issued a ""final order concluding that [the Anthrax Vaccine] was the best available medical countermeasure to the potential military emergency.""

Although Col. Rempfer filed a lawsuit to protest the FDA's decision, it was to no avail, and shortly afterward the Department of Defense resumed the vaccine program. Col. Dingle died of cancer in 2008, but Col. Rempfer remained critical of the anthrax vaccine program and still actively advocates on behalf of past and future military personnel.

A compromise

US Navy/MCS 2nd Class Alex Corona

Since the passage of the BioShield Act, Congress has continued to support the FDA's authority to make unapproved drugs available in response to new threats. In 2017, the Department of Defense sought power to unilaterally authorize use of unapproved drugs in battlefield situations.

In the face of FDA objections to this level of autonomy, Congress created a compromise measure memorialized in a Memorandum of Understanding that allows the Department of Defense broad authority to declare the need for emergency use permission and request that the FDA ""take actions to expedite the development of a medical product."" But final authority to issue an emergency use order rests with the president.

It is because of the servicemen committed to the preservation of informed consent that troops today have early access to potential COVID-19 drugs and vaccines while still respecting their vulnerability as patients without the complete ability to give informed consent.

It has been less than two months since the world scrambled to go into the ""Great Lockdown"" to slow the spread of COVID-19. Now many countries are considering their exit strategies. Some have already eased up.

The push is largely economic. There is a lot scientists don't yet understand about the novel coronavirus, and there is no known cure or vaccine. Many countries are still experiencing a rise in infections. But the lockdowns have played havoc with people's livelihoods. Entire economies are in meltdown: The International Monetary Fund predicts the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.

Just as each nation chose a different route into lockdown, each is likely to choose its own exit path. I have launched a research initiative, ""Imagining a Digital Economy for All 2030,"" with a focus on the post-pandemic global economy.

We have been studying the characteristics of 40 countries that help explain how governments and citizens have acted to contain the COVID-19 outbreak and their preparedness to take an economy online. Our analysis offers ways to gauge which countries are best prepared for a safe exit.

It seems clear that the safest idea is to reopen slowly, in phases, while remaining ready to reenter lockdown in case of new outbreaks. By looking at how well a nation managed the first wave of the pandemic, and how ready it is to work remotely by falling back onto the online economy, we now understand how prepared nations are to restart economic activity without triggering fresh rounds of public health disasters.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

Analysts say the experience of SARS has guided the Chinese military's prompt response, but combat effectiveness has still been affected.

China's military may have been spared any coronavirus infections, but the global health crisis has slowed the progress of Chinese President Xi Jinping's plan to transform the People's Liberation Army into a modern fighting force capable of long-range power-projecting operations, experts say.

According to China's defence ministry, the world's largest armed force — with about 2.3 million personnel — has had zero confirmed cases of Covid-19. In contrast, the US and Russian militaries, ranked second- and third-largest in the world, have reported more than 4,000 and 1,000 respectively.

But the PLA has been affected in other ways by the disease, which was first reported in Wuhan in December before going on to infect 3.9 million people around the world to date.

Safety concerns delayed its annual spring recruitment programme — it has been rescheduled for August — while the PLA Navy was forced to change its training arrangements, switching to classroom study of military theory and tactics, according to Xinhua.

""The PLA is still a conscription army and, given its large turnover of soldiers every year and the late recruitment and training plan this year, the coronavirus pandemic has already affected combat effectiveness,"" said Adam Ni, director of the China Policy Centre, an independent, non-profit research organisation based in Canberra, Australia.

The navy's operations, in particular, would have been affected, according to Charlie Lyons Jones, a researcher from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute's defence and strategy programme.

""The Chinese navy, short of highly effective disease control measures, is unlikely to avoid similar outbreaks of the novel coronavirus on board its warships,"" he said.

""Therefore, even if the PLA Navy currently has zero personnel infected by the novel coronavirus, its position as a navy that can operate effectively in a period of higher-than-normal tension remains precarious at best,"" Jones said. He also questioned Beijing's claims that the military was virus-free.

""The PLA played an important role in China's response to the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan … The idea that none of these personnel working on the front lines in Wuhan became infected by the novel coronavirus would be inconsistent with the experiences of countries from around the world,"" he said.

More than 4,000 military medical workers were sent to Wuhan as part of China's effort to contain the outbreak at ground zero — which included the rapid-built emergency field facility, the Huoshenshan hospital — and their efforts were highlighted in a documentary screened recently by state broadcaster CCTV.

At the time, rumours were rampant that the Chinese military had been affected by the coronavirus, fuelled by a report on February 17 by the official PLA Daily that some soldiers had been placed in quarantine and Yu Qiusong, captain of the Changzhou type 054A frigate, was isolating in a guest house. The news report did not mention why the personnel were in quarantine.

But analysts said that whether the official numbers were accurate, the PLA's closed management, fast response and past experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) gave China's military an advantage in keeping the coronavirus at bay.

Zhou Chenming, a Beijing-based military observer, said a key reason for the less serious hit to the PLA compared to other forces was its speed in recognising the severity of the situation.

""What's more, the PLA has its own logistic support system that can help minimise its contact with the outside world, thus reducing the possibility of contracting the virus,"" he said.

According to Xinhua, the PLA's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention drew up an emergency response plan and mobilisation arrangements on January 20, the same day Xi issued an instruction to the public that the virus must be ""resolutely contained.""

Timothy Heath, a senior international defence research analyst with the Rand Corporation, a US think tank, said China's military had benefited from its less international role, compared to US forces.

""The US is a globally distributed force while the Chinese military largely operates on the mainland. The US thus faces challenges in containing the disease that the Chinese military does not have to face … and the US military has a large range of missions and tasks it carries out to counter threats to its allies and partners, as well as to US security. This complicates efforts by the US military to carry out disease control measures,"" he said.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

Business Insider spoke to several influencers across multiple categories on how they are making money despite the ad downturn.

Creators shared the top ways they've been earning – from selling merchandise to creating subscription-based memberships and driving commission sales.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Many influencers are still earning revenue this year despite a sharp downturn in sponsored post deals from brands.

Some have adjusted the types of content they make to account for new consumer taste during the coronavirus pandemic. Audiences on social media aren't searching for the same content as before, but they are still active, growing quickly, and hungry for information that's relevant to life at home.

Travel influencer Christina Vidal, who has 85,000 Instagram followers, began to notice her readership dip in mid-March, she told Business Insider.

To bring back her audience, Vidal has been leaning into other content verticals like food and lifestyle. She studied Google search results to identify what topics were trending and has customized her posts to increase their likelihood of showing up in those searches.

Alongside shifting content, creators have also had to change up their business models and move away from ad-supported revenue streams as brands cut marketing budgets. Sponsored posts fell from representing 35% of influencer posts in mid-February to 4% of creator content in mid-April, according to a report from the marketing-analytics firm Launchmetrics.

While sponsored content has long been a predictable (and essential) source of income for digital creators, the industry offers a variety of other revenue streams like merchandise, direct-to-consumer products, and content production deals that creators are leaning into.

The biggest factor propping up the influencer industry in recent weeks is a spike in consumer demand for social content, which is stronger than ever.

TikTok just broke a record for the most app downloads in a single quarter and Instagram influencers have reported a large bump in user engagement on the app's Stories and Live features, following a broader trend toward more live content consumption on platforms like Twitch and Facebook. Google reported a year-over-year spike in YouTube viewership during its first-quarter earnings call.

The influencer economy hasn't been destroyed by the advertising meltdown, as creators make money from merch, subscriptions, and even personalized shout-outs



Direct ad revenue from YouTube and sponsored content can prove unreliable, so many influencers are getting smart about finding ways to diversify.

Some influencers have larger business ventures, like YouTube creator Preston Arsement, who is also the CEO of the digital-media studio TBNR, which Forbes estimated earned $14 million before taxes from June 2018 to June 2019. Others sell consumer products like makeup, merchandise, or books that have the potential to become New York Times bestsellers.

Some of the new ways creators have been turning their followers into paying customers (especially while social distancing) are by sending personalized video messages to fans through the app Cameo or by creating a subscription-based membership program through Patreon.

""For the first time in history, every athlete, actor, creator, comedian, and musician is suddenly sitting on the couch,"" Cameo CEO Steven Galanis said. ""Their events are being canceled and all that revenue and fan interaction that they get is just suddenly gone. Talent are coming on and giving it a try because suddenly they aren't busy or making as much money as before.""

Travel influencers have been leaning into other content verticals like food and lifestyle to reach wider audiences

Many influencers, like Vidal, who primarily work in the travel category, said they have had to drastically change their businesses.

To stay afloat financially, she decided to pivot and focus on what her audience would be more interested in right now, like easy recipes and a quarantine gift-giving guide.

""I focus on luxury travel, and that is definitely not what people were thinking about in mid-to-late March and in all of April,"" she told Business Insider. ""I immediately was like, 'OK, if people aren't reading about travel, I need to write about other things.'""

Vidal is not alone in having to make changes to her content in recent weeks.

Business Insider spoke with several travel influencers on which strategies they were focusing on to continue to earn revenue and build up readership, more here:

For some YouTube creators, merchandise sales have made up for a loss in ad revenue

YouTube creator Michael Groth, who has 1 million subscribers, told Business Insider that the average rate YouTube paid him began dropping sharply at the end of March.

Creators like Groth can earn money in a number of ways, including direct-to-consumer sales and brand sponsorships. But for many, direct YouTube revenue makes up a big chunk of their income.

""I've known for a while that YouTube AdSense can do crazy stuff like this,"" Groth said. ""I've made efforts to diversify over the years. My diversification has never surpassed my YouTube AdSense earnings because my AdSense earnings have been pretty healthy, but that may change now.""

Business Insider spoke to YouTubers on how their average rates have changed and how they are adapting their digital businesses. Here's what they said: Some YouTube creators say their ad rates have dropped sharply in recent weeks and increased views haven't made up for the loss in income Arsement said he had switched his focus to gaming content he could easily film from home and had been leaning into direct sales from his merchandise business. He said his CPM rate had dropped by over 50% since the coronavirus outbreak began, but merchandise sales had made up for that loss in revenue by nearly tripling. Arsement has been selling T-shirts, hoodies, and other branded accessories to make up for lost revenue. He also launched a new channel. Check out what he did to capitalize on the increased YouTube viewership here: How a YouTube star making an estimated $14 million per year has adapted his business in recent weeks, as ad rates drop by over 50% but merch sales nearly triple Some influencers are being paid for their content creation skills rather than their 'influence' As production companies shut down photo and video shoots in order to adhere to social-distancing measures, some marketers have been turning to influencers for their content creation skills. Many influencers have worked from home for years and are already equipped with the production gear necessary to create commercial content for brands. ""For the first time, big brands aren't able to make those big budget television ads,"" said Karyn Spencer, the senior vice president of partnerships at Whalar, an influencer-marketing agency. ""You don't need that full-blown production anymore. YouTubers taught us that.""

Live-video marketing on social-media platforms has long been a revenue driver for Twitch gamers and other streamers who have pitched brands on their sizable recurring live audiences. But as interest in live content spreads to other social-media platforms like Instagram — which traditionally has focused on posed photos and videos — more influencers and brands have been experimenting with the format as a marketing opportunity. ""People are more apt to spend 30, 60, or 90 minutes on an influencer or branded livestream, whereas they're typically only engaging with a static photo on a feed for a couple seconds,"" said Ellie Jenkins, an influencer-innovation manager at Mavrck.

That's going to inverse.'

Airbnb is about connecting people. Before this crisis, we brought 2 million people together a day, and when this crisis ends, we're going to get back to doing just that. But to get there, we are going to need to be scrappy. We're going to be nimble, we're going to simplify our operations and focus on what makes us different: our community of hosts.

No one knows for sure [how the crisis will change the travel industry], but I can give you two thoughts. First, when the comeback starts, it will start locally. People are going to take trips that are close to home and they're going to want something affordable. Second, I think we're seeing that you can do a lot [via] video conferencing, and that's going to have a big impact on how often people travel for work. Business travel isn't going to go away, but I think it's going to look very different in the future.

We used to do a lot of travel for work and then we entertained ourselves on screens. That's going to inverse. I think we'll work more on screens and entertain ourselves in the real world.

I also think many people are realizing they don't have to be tethered to one city. So you'll see more people who are going to choose to live around the world, spending a few months at a time in different places. And we're going to focus in part on longer-term stays to better serve those people.

I've also been thinking about what won't change. In 1950, 25 million people crossed a border, and last year 1.4 billion people did. That happened because there is an innate human desire to travel, to explore and that is never going to go away. Travel may be on pause, but it's going to come back.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

Here's what it means.",https://i.insider.com/5ebd67e5cea43700ee074598?width=1200&format=jpeg,"According to a report from Douglas Elliman, Manhattan's rental market saw the number of new leases drop to a record low in April compared to the same time last year.

However, both Manhattan's non-luxury and luxury market market also saw an increase in median rent.

In addition, Brooklyn and Queens also saw increases in median rent and huge drops in the number of new listings.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

In the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, many Manhattan renters have opted to renew their leases for the year as they continue to follow stay-at-home orders.

In fact, according to an April market report from Douglas Elliman, the number of new leases in Manhattan saw a 70.9% year-over-year decrease to 1,407. According to the report, that is the lowest number of new leases recorded in a decade and the largest percent decline ever recorded.

The Elliman report credits that decline to the coronavirus pandemic, stating that ""new leasing activity declined at record rates due to the COVID-19 shutdown, while the market share of lease renewals surged as tenants sought relief,""

In addition, the report found that the April vacancy rate, which was 2.42%, was the highest recorded in at least 14 years.

But Manhattan's median rent price actually rose in the midst of these declines, and was up 4.9% compared to April 2019, to $3,650. The rental price per square foot was up 9% to $74.20.

Like the non-luxury market, Manhattan's luxury market saw a drastic year-over-year drop in the number of new leases, down 71.1% compared to April 2019.

And, like the non-luxury market, the median rent for the higher end also saw a year-over-year increase, up 5.5% to $8,650.

Queens and Brooklyn saw a similar April fate

Both Brooklyn and Queens saw the number of new leases in April drop by more than 60% compared to the same time last year.

In Queens, the number of new leases fell by 64.9% to 100, and in Brooklyn, the number of new leases fell 66.8% to 439.

""The record decline in new leasing activity due to the Coronavirus crisis indicated that renewal activity was where the weakness in rental price trends could be found,"" the report reads.

""Renewal leasing activity surged in response to the sharp drop in new leasing activity caused by COVID-19 shelter in place rules, skewing aggregate new leasing price trends higher,""

But, like Manhattan, both markets saw a year-over year increase in the median rent price.

In Queens, the median rental price rose by 4.2% to $2970. And in Brooklyn, the median rental price shot up 14.4% to $3,259, a new record, according to the report.

The rental market still faces obstacles, such as rent strikes, as the pandemic drags on

As of May 6, 80.2% of apartment households were able to make full or partial rent payments.

To arrive at that percentage, the National Multifamily Housing Council's Rent Payment Tracker surveyed 11.4 million units of professionally managed apartment units across the US.

The tracker found that May's 80.2% was an improvement on April, which saw 78% of rents paid, and a slight decrease from 81.7% in May 2019.

According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, the unexpectedly high amount of renters able to make payments in May points to the effectiveness of stimulus checks and expanded unemployment benefits, but some fear that won't continue to be enough.

If policy makers don't address the stress renters are under because of the pandemic, mass evictions, deteriorating housing stock, and a real estate or housing market crash are all at stake, a report by the Urban Institute predicts.

""We argue that there is a need for a national rental assistance program. None of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act programs provide that,"" the report reads.

The hashtags #CancelRent and #CantPayMay have been trending on Twitter in response to the growing unemployment rate. And a group called Westriketogether.org claims that around 200,000 people across the US have signed petitions committing to not pay rent until the government takes action on rent, as noted by the WSJ.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

If you are quarantining or working from home with your partner, and are starting to get on each other's nerves, Petro recommends looking into couples therapy — it can be more impactful now than ever.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

My husband and I started couples counseling at the end of February, when coronavirus had yet to be widely detected in the US. Becoming parents had tested our relationship, and recent challenges in particular — including the arrival of our second baby this past December — had made existing tensions worse. We wanted to communicate better, to treat one another more lovingly and bicker less often, particularly in front of our two year old son, who — much to my heartbreak — had begun acting out when the two of us would start fighting.

Arran and I were three sessions in and things were going well when the public health crisis escalated. As New Yorkers, we were encouraged to practice social distancing and began sheltering in place. We pulled our son out of daycare, and my husband began to work remotely. Thankfully, we've relocated to a spacious house upstate, rather than our 600-foot apartment. Even so, it's been an emotional rollercoaster. Like most Americans, we're stressed about money. We take turns feeling anxious and fearful. We're sometimes at odds when it comes to parenting our rambunctious toddler. Even though we all love to spend time together, we definitely get on one another's nerves.

While the midst of a deadly pandemic may feel like the wrong time to be working on your #couplesgoals, experts are clear in their advice that now is not the time to stop taking actions that address your mental health — and when it comes to interventions like couples or family therapy, it might even be a great time to start.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

On Wednesday, Momofuku announced it would permanently close two restaurants: Nishi in New York City and CCDC in Washington, DC.

Other possible changes at Momofuku that Mariscal discussed in April include ending the tipped wage, recalibrating delivery fees, and diversifying business to make restaurants just one of many revenue streams.

Momofuku — a beloved restaurant empire that includes New York City's famed Momofuku Noodle Bar, upscale Momofuku Ko, and chicken-sandwich chain Fuku — isn't going to be the same when the coronavirus pandemic is over.

CEO Marguerite Mariscal told Business Insider that how Momofuku's mix of ""art and commerce"" translates in the ""next few months, a year, and beyond is still being written.""

""The last month has shone a light on some of the industry's practices that were previously barely tenable in the first place,"" Mariscal said in April. ""We are hopefully going to see a reform that will better position restaurants, even after there's a vaccine.""

Mariscal added: ""The worst thing a restaurant can do is go back to 'normal.' We need to all use this time to reevaluate industry standards.""

On Wednesday, Momofuku announced it would close two restaurants: Nishi in New York City and CCDC in Washington, DC. The company will also move the location of New York City's Ssäm Bar, combining the restaurant's staff with that of Wayō, which opened in 2019.

""Momofuku's guiding principle has always been that 'what got us here, won't get us there,'"" Mariscal wrote on Momofuku's website on Wednesday. ""Now more than ever, it is essential. This crisis has exposed the underlying vulnerabilities of our industry and made clear that returning to normal is not an option.""

Mariscal said in April that Momofuku was looking into changes included reexamining a tipped wage, which may no longer make sense when a larger percentage of revenue comes from takeaway. Delivery fees — which can be up to 30% of an order — may no longer be defensible as more customers order their food. And contactless delivery will somehow still have to inspire connection.

Mariscal said the pandemic has pushed Momofuku to diversify its business and approach restaurants as just one of multiple revenue streams.

""For us to take better care of our employees, we need to be profitable in and outside the four walls of a restaurant — whether that's through takeaway, products for the home, or content to cook along to,"" Mariscal said.

Mariscal became Momofuku Restaurant Group's first-ever CEO in 2019, taking the reins of the company from founder David Chang. Chang has emerged as an outspoken advocate for independent restaurants during the pandemic, highlighting the difficulties restaurants face, both during closures and as they consider reopening.

""There's a good chance Momofuku may never reopen again, or the restaurant that you love to go so much in your neighborhood will never reopen again if we don't support the supply chain and the purveyors and the farmers and the workers all surrounding it,"" Chang told Vice in April.

Mariscal said she expected the restaurant industry to evolve but the fundamentals to remain the same. People still want to ""celebrate and commiserate with those we love."" The industry's financials and operations will simply need to evolve to meet that need.

Many said the pandemic has led them to believe that in-person meetings are often unnecessary, and that traveling for business may not be as valuable — or essential — as they once thought.

As Paul Hudson, CEO of Sanofi, said, ""the one-business meeting trip will disappear.""

This feature is part of a series based on conversations with more than 200 CEOs on how business will be transformed by the coronavirus. To read more, click here.

As the global pandemic upends business, CEOs are figuring out what practices they need to keep — and what they can lose for good.

From scaling back on their real estate to rethinking remote work, mandated social distancing has forced leaders to confront the idea that what used to be the professional norm may no longer be the best way to continue. That includes taking a hard look at business trips and questioning when they're really worth taking.

As the pandemic shut down airlines and hotels and brought travel to a halt, the $1 trillion business travel sector took a massive hit. According to data compiled by Tourism Economics for the US Travel Association, travel spending was down by $119 billion for the period between March 1 and April 25, a decrease of more than 80% over the same period in 2019.

About 30% of total travel spending in 2019 was for business travel, accounting for about $334.2 billion in spending and about 2.5 million jobs, according to the US Travel Association. Business travel is typically also the biggest revenue generator for the hotel industry, and conventions and other meetings being pushed out into 2021 is a growing concern.

Travel industry experts have been predicting that after the outbreak eases in the US, vacations will return well before business travel does.

Business Insider recently asked more than 200 chief executive officers at some of the world's largest companies how business will be transformed by the coronavirus.

Many of these leaders noted that the pandemic has already caused their stance on in-person meetings to evolve.

""I think we're seeing that you can do a lot [via] video conferencing, and that's going to have a big impact on how often people travel for work,"" Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky told Business Insider. ""Business travel isn't going to go away, but I think it's going to look very different in the future.""

""It may be the case that we can do less travel, but we can get more done, that we're more thoughtful about what the live meetings need to be,"" said Doug Ingram, CEO of Sarepta Therapeutics, a medical research company based in Massachusetts.

The end of the one-meeting business trip

Donna Imperato, CEO of PR and communications firm BCW Global, told Business Insider that the company recently completed a pitch that was drawn out over the course of months and involved employees traveling all over the world.

In retrospect and in regards to all the travel involved, she said, ""I don't think it was necessary to spend all that time to get the same outcome.""

Imperato isn't the only leader rethinking how prominent a role business travel needs to play in future operations.

The coronavirus pandemic has forced a shift to remote work that had already been in progress for several years. And, businesses that have implemented the infrastructure for remote work in response to the pandemic may realize that that setup works for them just fine.

Some executives speaking with Business Insider said they were surprised to find that going remote has actually made their workforce more productive, perhaps because they are doing less networking and person-to-person interacting.

""Paradoxically, the crisis has significantly improved the way we operate and made us more efficient with no lunches, dinners, or traveling,"" Sir Martin Sorrell, chairman of S4 Capital, a media company based in London, said. Sorrell is also the founder and former CEO of advertising giant WPP.

This shift in mindset will likely mean that many business leaders will take a more discerning approach when scheduling trips.

""Undoubtedly, the experiments we're all going through by using video conferencing, FaceTime facilities for quick meetings a quick exchange of ideas has certainly changed significantly our behavior,"" Thomas Flohr, CEO of private jet company VistaJet, told Business Insider. ""So in the short-term, I don't see travel [is going] to rebound anywhere in the near future.""

Paul Hudson, CEO of Sanofi, a pharmaceutical company that's headquartered in New Jersey and employs more than 100,000 people globally, said that ""the one-business meeting trip will disappear.""

""People will be more comfortable with virtual meeting solutions and travel will become something we do when it's absolutely necessary,"" he said.

Embracing alternatives — for now

Several leaders said it would take a viable vaccine for this to change.

""We'll continue to rely on technology and new thinking to perform our jobs,"" Dave Burwick, CEO of The Boston Beer Company, said. ""And at least until there's a vaccine, we expect to be traveling less on planes and not interacting with large groups of people.""

Until then, business leaders are embracing virtual meetings and conferences.

""There will still be times when the industry will need to come together in person. I look forward to the day when there is a vaccine so that will be possible,"" Terry Duffy, chairman and CEO of CME Group, said. ""In the meantime, we will need to be more creative, rethinking old ways of doing business and developing new ones that fit this new reality.""

Business travel will look different once it resumes

Hilton is developing new hygiene protocols, including placing a seal on doors to indicate that no one has entered since it was last cleaned. Hilton

Hotels and other hospitality branches catering to business travelers will likely have to implement additional hygiene measures as they start to welcome people back.

55% of the business travelers surveyed by Engagious said that visible medical screenings like temperature checks and swabs before entering a venue would have a positive impact on their willingness to resume visits to places like airports, hotels, and restaurants.

Hospitality businesses are gearing up for this shift in mentality, rolling out enhanced cleaning protocols and social distancing measures. As Chris Nassetta, president and CEO of Hilton, told Business Insider, hotels will endure as gathering points for a variety of events, including business meetings, ""though likely with some adjustments.""

""As wedding receptions, business meetings, and social gatherings return, the way our Team Members deliver food and beverage service will also change,"" Nassetta said. ""We can expect the demand for buffet and communal dining to change, and the opportunity for personalized, one-on-one service to increase.""

Ultimately, it's likely to be years before business travel returns to the levels set in 2019, if it ever does.

Gary Kelly, CEO of Southwest Airlines, said in an April earnings call that business travel could take more than five years to return to levels from last year. Business travel makes up about a third of Southwest's passenger traffic, he said.

""Based on history, in a recessionary environment, it is a long recovery period for businesses. And it's intuitive to me on why that would be,"" he said. ""This one feels like it could be worse.""",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

In a 2015 TED talk, Gates said the world was ""not ready for the next epidemic.""

And in a 2018 discussion about epidemics hosted by the Massachusetts Medical Society and the New England Journal of Medicine, Gates said a pandemic could happen within the next decade.

He presented a simulation by the Institute for Disease Modeling which found that a new flu like the one that killed 50 million people in the 1918 pandemic would now most likely kill 30 million people within six months.

The likelihood that such a disease will appear continues to rise in our interconnected world, he said, whether it happens naturally or is created as a weaponized disease.

""In the case of biological threats, that sense of urgency is lacking,"" he said. ""The world needs to prepare for pandemics in the same serious way it prepares for war.""

Gates said in an April interview with the Financial Times that a viral outbreak will likely happen ""every 20 years or so."" The coronavirus pandemic outbreak will cause future governments to have ""standby diagnostics, deep antiviral libraries, and early warning systems,"" he added.

""The cost of doing all those things well is very small compared to what we're going through here,"" he said. ""And so now people realize, 'OK, there really is a meaningful probability every 20 years or so with lots of world travel that one of these [viruses] will come along.'

In addition, mortgage rates are predicted to drop to record lows, to below 3% by the end of 2020, but will come with stricter requirements.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Home sales are in for a rocky ride for the remainder of 2020, according to a new forecast by Realtor.com.

Realtor.com's chief economist, Danielle Hale, predicted that home sales will rebound in July, August, and September, as buyers return to the market.

However, she said she believes they will drop again in the final months of the year as secondary waves of coronavirus infections continue to spread throughout the US and the unemployment rate remains high.

Overall, existing home sales are predicted to see a 15% year-over-year decrease by the end of 2020, while home prices flatten nationally due to buyer interest in the secondary market, according to the report.

""The US housing market started 2020 with substantial momentum. With some of the best home sales and housing starts in more than a decade, our biggest challenge going into the spring home-buying season was a lack of for sale homes. The coronavirus pandemic has kept both buyers and sellers on the sidelines, preserving market balance, for now,"" Hale was quoted saying in the report. ""As cities and states begin the slow process of reopening, we're going to see a see-saw recovery with ups and downs that will favor the nation's secondary markets in the short-term.""

The sharp nosedive in number of new listings exacerbates the issue of a lack of inventory, which has been evident since the start of the pandemic. In the last week of March, new listings were down 36.9% from the same time last year. For the week ending April 17, that decline had spiked to nearly 50%, according to Redfin, while Realtor.com reported that new listings were down 39% for the week ending May 2.

Realtor.com explained that while the market will continue to see constricted inventory, buyer demand is expected to be inconsistent as many will likely pull back during the second wave of the outbreak. On a national level, home prices are expected to increase just 1.1% for 2020, with possible small declines by the end of the year, meaning there won't be many deals for buyers or sellers in this market.

Mortgages rates are predicted to drop below 3% by the end of 2020

According to Realtor.com, mortgage rates are forecasted to hit record lows below 3% by the end of the year. But mortgages will be harder to get, too.

""Although rates will be favorable, the qualifying criteria will be tougher than normal as lenders seek to mitigate their own risks amid the unfolding economic uncertainty globally. The stricter qualifying criteria will require buyers to have higher credit scores in addition to more cash for down payments,"" the report reads.

Housingwire has reported that as the outbreak worsened, lenders have already raised lending standards and access to Federal Housing Administration loans has dried up. In fact, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that mortgage credit availability was down in April to its lowest level since 2014.

""Buyers should expect periods of very low inventory turnover, especially if subsequent COVID-19 flare-ups occur, creating a 'what you see is what you get' environment. In some areas, buyers may find sellers leaning heavily on digital technology, such as virtual tours, instead of hosting traditional open houses. Determined buyers may need to be prepared to pull the trigger on a home sight unseen,"" the report reads.

But it's not all bad news for buyers. Realtor.com predicts that due to the likelihood of stable home prices, there will be less all-cash offers from investors to compete with which, according to the report, dominated the market back in 2008.

That's the question thousands of workers across the world are facing as global travel has ground to a halt because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The airline and hotel industries have been devastated. Companies like Marriott and Expedia have slashed their advertising budgets, creating a domino effect on the news media that relies heavily on ad revenue. Gannett, the largest US newspaper company, has made pay cuts and put many staffers on partial furlough. McClatchy, owner of 30 US newspapers, said in April that it would lay off four executives and furlough about 115 employees. Vox Media furloughed about 100 employees and halted all pay increases for the rest of 2020.

Travel media, already a fragile industry, is also poised to take a hard hit. Legacy travel magazines like Travel + Leisure and Condé Nast Traveler have been hit by pay cuts, as well as content and freelance budget cuts. Digital media companies that built their brands off of helping their readers travel the globe, such as The Points Guy, have seen a drop in credit card sign-ups. Travel influencers and freelance writers across the world have found themselves with no work.

Rafat Ali, the CEO of Skift, a travel news and industry intelligence company, told Business Insider that the pain is likely only beginning for the media industry.

""I think some of the layoffs in the media industry are too small,"" Ali said. ""I think it's unfortunately going to be a lot worse than people are imagining in terms of the hurt the media will have to go through.""

'Different stages of hurt'

Per Ali, many major media organizations have made the mistake of covering travel as a leisure, not as a business.

""I think that the biggest disservice that the travel industry has done to itself is to market itself as a leisure. And what that means is it's also disposable, which means that it's the first thing that gets cut in media in general,"" Ali said, pointing to the New York Times' recent decision to temporarily stop publishing its travel section in its Sunday print edition.

The pandemic has ushered in an ""age of news,"" and many travel magazines focus on longer feature pieces rather than hard news, according to Ali.

""They're not built for the metabolism that this time needs,"" he said.

Conde Nast Traveler and Travel + Leisure, the two legacy brands that dominate the travel magazine scene, have both encountered major challenges since the pandemic first brought life in the US to a halt eight weeks ago. And smaller travel magazines such as Afar, which lack the resources of larger publications, could face even more distress.

""I wouldn't be surprised — not that there are even many travel magazines left — but I wouldn't be surprised if there are even less left in the next year,"" Ali told Business Insider.

Many of the biggest companies that advertise with travel magazines are suffering themselves. In mid-March, Airbnb suspended all of its marketing activities. A week later, on March 19, Marriott CEO Arne Morris Sorenson said that the world's largest hotel company's advertising budget had ""gone dark."" Expedia normally spends $5 billion on advertising but plans to spend less than $1 billion in 2020.

Some travel magazines had relatively robust sales at newsstands and airports before the pandemic, Ali said. But now, with virtually nobody traveling or going to newsstands, ""they're all, I'm sure, in different stages of hurt,"" he said.

Readers want travel content that answers their practical travel questions right now

Condé Nast Traveler's parent company, Condé Nast, announced pay cuts for its highest-earning staff and said it could announce layoffs by the end of May. Condé Nast Traveler has not laid off any staffers, but it has reduced its freelance budget and made cuts to its content budget, a spokesperson for the magazine told Business Insider. Many of the magazine's advertising partners have postponed campaigns until later in the year after the travel sector opens back up.

The magazine did not provide Business Insider with specific numbers for how advertising revenue had been affected, but Jesse Ashlock, Condé Nast Traveler's US Editor, described a bleak outlook.

""I'm not going to lie and say that we're healthy right now,"" Ashlock told Business Insider. ""It's a tough time. We've had a precipitous decline in the second quarter and we anticipate that continuing into the third quarter.""

Jesse Ashlock, US Editor for Condé Nast Traveler. Condé Nast Traveler

Condé Nast Traveler has pivoted from conventional destination-oriented coverage toward both coronavirus coverage and ""pure inspo,"" as Ashlock describes it.

""People want to know about how coronavirus is impacting airline policies, booking policies, when am I gonna be able to travel again, all those kinds of fundamental questions that anybody who loves travel is going to have right now,"" he said. ""And people also want permission to dream, to just have a kind of escape hatch in a way that travel can also provide.""

Readers want practical information on how the coronavirus is affecting travel right now, Ashlock says. Condé Nast Traveler

Travel + Leisure's parent company, Meredith, has frozen hiring and implemented sweeping pay cuts for 60% of its employees, but has not announced any layoffs.

The magazine saw a 14% increase in unique visitors to its website in March as compared to the same time period in 2019, according to figures from media analytics company Comscore. While April's Comscore numbers were not yet available at the time of publication, the spokesperson said that, per internal reporting, the magazine did not see the same boost in readership in April.

""In general, the media landscape is really challenging right now,"" Jacqueline Gifford, Travel + Leisure's editor-in-chief, told Business Insider.

Like Condé Nast Traveler, Travel + Leisure has had to adjust its coverage to the times. Gifford said the magazine, which prints 12 issues per year, held off on publishing a planned piece on Italy's Emilia Romagna region — one of the hardest-hit by the virus — that had been in the works for a year. The magazine's new mix of coverage includes practical tips such as how to get airline refunds, pieces on virtual travel, and stories like an essay about learning to love wherever you are.

While travel magazines may be adapting in the short term, the worst may be yet to come, according to Skift's Ali.

""Advertising will be hurt even when the recovery starts,"" Ali told Business Insider. ""... There's businesses that will close, tour operators and travel agents, that advertise a lot in these fancy magazines. Destinations will be hurt.""

Businesses will still need to advertise, but whether they will splurge for space in travel magazines remains to be seen, he said.

Lucrative digital media companies are waiting out the pandemic

Meanwhile, digital media companies whose business models seem based on affiliate revenue seem better positioned to weather the downturn.

The Points Guy, a profitable travel and credit-card-rewards website also known as TPG, rakes in affiliate fees by getting readers to sign up for credit cards or reward programs. Every time someone signs up for a credit card or rewards program via the site, the company collects anywhere from $25 to $700, a former editorial employee previously told Business Insider.

But in a global pandemic that has halted travel and left millions jobless, not many people are signing up for credit cards or travel rewards programs.

TPG has seen ""a massive drop"" in credit card sign-ups, a current employee told Business Insider. Some of the company's bank partners, including Bank of America and Capital One, have pulled all affiliate links from TPG, according to internal emails reviewed by Business Insider.

A spokesperson for Capital One declined to comment on the record about its affiliate marketing activities, but CEO Richard Fairbank said in an earnings call on April 23 that the company is ""pulling back on marketing in the near term"" due to the coronavirus. A spokesperson for Bank of America also declined to comment.

TPG has not announced any layoffs or pay cuts, but some employees may be temporarily reassigned to other brands owned by TPG's parent company, Red Ventures, the employee said.

But TPG may have the resources to weather the crisis. The company has been profitable every year it has existed, CEO Brian Kelly told Digiday in 2019. In the year before the pandemic, it made upwards of $50 million in profit, according to the current employee.

""They were very cash rich to begin with going into this, so at minimum they have tons of cash reserve, not just them, but their parent company [Red Ventures] as well,"" says Ali. ""... Their business, which is credit cards, I'm sure is hurt a lot, but again, they have the money.""

Business Insider reached out to TPG and Red Ventures for comment on this article. TPG did not respond to the request directly but declined through Red Ventures. Red Ventures also declined to comment.

While TPG is one of the most prominent travel media start-ups, it's not the only one that relies heavily on affiliate revenue. Nomadic Matt, a travel website founded by Matt Kepnes, usually makes money through affiliate bookings, advertising revenue, events, and book sales. But in the second week of March, there was an immediate drop.

""There are no affiliate revenues, no one's booking travel,"" Kepnes told Business Insider. ""I think I made like a hundred bucks last month.""

A post shared by Matt Kepnes | Nomadic Matt (@nomadicmatt) Apr 22, 2020 at 12:59pm PDT

Thanks to assistance from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a $349 billion relief fund of government-backed loans for small businesses, Kepnes hasn't had to lay off his four employees. He thinks the business will be able to stay afloat until the fall.

""I think by then people will start booking again,"" he said. ""Will it be as good as it was pre-COVID? No. But we have pretty low expenses other than salaries, so I'm not too worried. We had a lot in the bank.""

From getting paid for their travels across the globe to having nowhere to go

Travel influencers and freelance writers, who not too long ago were the envy of everyone who dreams of quitting their corporate job and getting paid to travel, now find themselves with no work — and often, with no safety net.

Even as people stuck in their homes are spending more time on social media, brands are slashing influencer marketing budgets, deferring payments, and postponing campaigns, devastating income for travel influencers, as Amanda Perelli and Dan Whateley recently reported for Business Insider.

A post shared by Oneika Raymond🇨🇦🇯🇲 (@oneikatraveller) Apr 28, 2020 at 9:43am PDT

Travel blogger Oneika Raymond, who has more than 84,500 Instagram followers, told Perelli and Whateley that ""companies are reluctant to take on anything new and therefore that is impacting the income of creators."" Another travel influencer, Lauren Bullen, who lives in Bali and has 2.1 million Instagram followers, said all her paid trips had been canceled.

Jimmy Im is a freelance travel writer who left a full-time staff job at CNBC Make It in September 2019 and has written for publications including Business Insider, Condé Nast Traveler, and Travel + Leisure. In a typical pre-pandemic month, he was traveling for two to three weeks and producing between two and six commissioned stories.

Then, in March, when he was in the Catskills in upstate New York working on three stories, the coronavirus was declared a pandemic. Two of his Catskills stories were canceled, and things went downhill from there.

""Work is nonexistent,"" Im told Business Insider at the end of April. ""Nobody is taking travel stories right now … Since the pandemic and the lockdowns, I've had zero, zero work.""

Im has had to cancel upcoming trips to Argentina and Florida and is living off of his savings and unemployment benefits. He's stayed busy working on his novel and his personal travel blog, but he's worried about how he's going to keep paying rent on his Manhattan apartment past July.

Travel blogger Kiersten Rich of The Blonde Abroad, who has upwards of 561,000 Instagram followers, told Business Insider that traffic to her blog has dwindled by 50% since January, leading to a drop in ad revenue and decreased affiliate link payouts. At least four of her contracted travel campaigns are on hold, she says.

In the meantime, Rich has pivoted to posting about home goods, self-improvement, and self-care on her blog and Instagram account. She expects the travel blogging industry to become even more competitive going forward.

""There will still be budgets for marketing, and destinations will be looking to attract visitors as soon as it's safe to travel again, but I think those brands will be more selective about who they work with, and on what platform,"" she said.

Silver linings

Despite travel media's current state of turmoil, some remain hopeful about the future of the industry. As Ali of Skift put it, not being able to travel has made the world realize just how important travel is.

Ashlock of Condé Nast Traveler says the pandemic may force travel publications to finally diversify their revenue streams.

""This is quite indicative of how challenging it can be to rely so heavily on advertising, and so that's something we're going to have to look closely at as we go forward,"" he said.

Kepnes of Nomadic Matt, meanwhile, is squaring up against the state of complete uncertainty ahead.

""Now, what happens after the summer? I don't really know,"" Kepnes said. ""I like to be optimistic, because if you're a pessimist, then how do you get through the day?""",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

More than a third of consumers have stopped visiting shops except for essential items, retail-technology startup Qudini's survey showed.

Based on consumer preferences for virtual services, the survey found that retailers in the UK should adjust to 3 new realities before they can reopen safely.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

While UK retailers anxiously await news from the government to restart business, they will have to consider 3 realities before opening doors once again, according to a survey by retail-technology startup, Qudini.

""The government is grappling with how to reopen stores in a secure way that protects the public, but if more stores reopen, this could lead to excessive queues outside of stores that could risk public safety,"" Imogen Wethered, chief executive of Qudini, told Business Insider.

""Queues were an iconic consequence of World War II rationing schemes, but with the smartphone technology now available to us three-quarters of a century later, it feels unnecessary that they should become an iconic part of the Coronavirus pandemic,"" she said.

Qudini's survey was conducted in March after the UK lockdown was enforced and took into account over 2,000 UK consumers aged between 16 and 90 to understand how retailers can navigate the Covid-19 landscape.

Here are 3 realities retailers should consider before they can be ready to safely reopen stores, as per findings from the survey:

1. Pre-booking visits and managing virtual queues

Owing to a strong demand for virtual services by consumers who are avoiding shop visits, retailers should look to build customer confidence in enabling store visits. Qudini found that about 50% of consumers would prefer 'essential' retailers (banks, pharmacies, and groceries) to provide virtual services over the phone.

60% of UK consumers reduced their visits to grocery stores. Qudini

Enhancing customer management processes would be key to establish effective social distancing inside and outside the store. This could be done through:

Allowing customers to pre-book their visits online

their visits online Managing walk-in customers through virtual queues (updates via text messages as their turn nears)

2. Launching click-and-collect services

42% of UK consumers said they would rather turn to click-and-collect services for groceries and pharmacies. Currently, there are limited services that cater to this demand, which is why consumers don't have an option but to visit stores for essentials.

Shoppers are more likely to use click-and-collect services during Covid-19. Qudini

In the near future, investing in contactless click-and-collect services would boost customer experiences and add long-term brand value by enabling safe curbside pick-ups.

3. Enabling personalized virtual relationships

Close to half of consumers surveyed signalled a strong demand for essential retailers to provide virtual services by phone as this would reduce in-store time significantly.

Brands that wish to create more personalized relationships could consider investing in one-to-one services to engage customers online. Qudini found that based on younger consumers having an interest in video services, it is increasingly likely that this trend would last well past the coronavirus outbreak and could be a catalyst for future brand interactions.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

It said it would close an undisclosed number of stores as part of the restructuring process.

The department store has been in the midst of a turnaround plan in order to reduce its roughly $4 billion in debt.

It was forced to temporarily close all of its 850 stores amid the coronavirus pandemic but began to reopen certain locations at the beginning of May.

JCPenney has filed for bankruptcy, with the 118-year-old company buckling under pressure from the coronavirus.

The company joins the growing list of large clothing retailers forced to file for bankruptcy protection, joining Neiman Marcus, J. Crew, and True Religion.

It said it would close an undisclosed number of stores as part of the restructuring process.

Citing people familiar with the matter, Reuters reported on April 14 that the department store chain was exploring bankruptcy after the coronavirus pandemic forced it to temporarily close all of its 850 stores.

On April 15, CNN Business reported that the company had missed a debt payment and invoked a 30-day grace period. It also skipped a second payment on May 7. The company has nearly $4 billion in debt.

In a May 14 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, JCPenney said it had made a $17 million interest payment.

It began to reopen stores in certain states at the beginning of May, implementing safety measures like plexiglass at registers and contactless curbside pickup.

""Until this pandemic struck, we had made significant progress rebuilding our company under our Plan for Renewal strategy — and our efforts had already begun to pay off. While we had been working in parallel on options to strengthen our balance sheet and extend our financial runway, the closure of our stores due to the pandemic necessitated a more fulsome review to include the elimination of outstanding debt,"" CEO Jill Soltau said in a press release about the bankruptcy filing.

The company said it had secured $900 million in debtor-in-possession financing as part of its bankruptcy filing.

JCPenney has faced years of struggles, failing to turn a profit since 2011. Like many other department stores, it's faced slumping sales as shoppers increasingly turn to online options and mall foot traffic declines. It has also faced stiff competition in off-price retailers like TJ Maxx and Ross Stores. Frequent changes to the executive team and shifting strategies did not help matters.

It attempted to rebrand itself several times, first chasing after younger shoppers before reverting back to trying to attract middle-aged women shopping for their family.

""JCPenney hasn't created an experience that solidifies a place in consumers' shopping habits,"" Kathy Gersch, executive vice president of the consultancy firm Kotter, told Business Insider in 2018. In a separate interview, Gersch said, ""They are creating an experience that isn't right for anyone. They are trying to serve too many people at the moment.""

JCPenney has closed dozens of stores in recent years, including six stores and a Kansas customer service center that permanently shuttered at the beginning of 2020. It reported that comparable sales decreased by 7.7% for the fiscal year ending February 1.

JCPenney had been in the midst of a turnaround plan, spearheaded by CEO Jill Soltau, that involves reducing inventory and sharpening its focus on its core audience of middle-class families.

As a result, the American retail industry has experienced a profoundly different new reality, requiring JCPenney to make difficult decisions in running our business to protect the safety of our associates and customers and the future of our company. Until this pandemic struck, we had made significant progress rebuilding our company under our Plan for Renewal strategy – and our efforts had already begun to pay off. While we had been working in parallel on options to strengthen our balance sheet and extend our financial runway, the closure of our stores due to the pandemic necessitated a more fulsome review to include the elimination of outstanding debt.

Implementing this financial restructuring plan through a court-supervised process is the best path to ensure that JCPenney will build on its over 100-year history to serve our customers for decades to come. We believe the RSA and the widespread support we have received from our asset-based lenders and first lien lenders will allow us to pursue a financial restructuring on an expedited timeframe. We are also encouraged by the level of support we have received from our vendor partners, landlords, and other stakeholders, whose confidence in our business and our people is expected to contribute to a successful reorganization.

We have a newly refreshed, highly experienced team of retail executives who remain focused on rebuilding our business and restoring financial strength to JCPenney. This team has continued to innovate even during these challenging times, implementing substantial improvements to our flagship eCommerce platform to increase efficiency and ensure our loyal customers continue to have access to the products they need through elevated shopping experiences. I would also like to thank all of our outstanding associates for their continued dedication to our company and their passion for meeting and exceeding our customers' expectations. We are continuing to serve our customers as we move through this process with a commitment to working seamlessly with our vendor partners and landlords. We look forward to emerging from both Chapter 11 and this pandemic as a stronger retailer, continuing to implement our Plan for Renewal, and building capabilities focused on satisfying customers' wants and needs.""",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

This week, BI launched its ""What's Next"" package, in which we talked to more than 200 CEOs about how the coronavirus is going to change their company, industry, and the world. I spoke with Momofuku CEO Marguerite Mariscal about how the restaurant industry will be forced to evolve due to the pandemic. Mariscal told me:

""The last month has shone a light on some of the industry's practices that were previously barely tenable in the first place. We are hopefully going to see a reform that will better position restaurants, even after there's a vaccine. The worst thing a restaurant can do is go back to 'normal.'""

I've been hearing from McDonald's employees about what it is like working at the chain during the pandemic over the last few months. At the same time, I've seen more news than ever before about workers' protests as part of the SEIU-backed Fight for 15 movement.

I pieced together what has been going down inside McDonald's, from worker unrest to tension with franchisees to new corporate policies.

McDonald's has already made major changes, including adding two weeks of paid sick leave for COVID-related cases and raising workers' pay. This week, news broke that McDonald's is beginning to allow franchisees to reopen stores, as well as offering additional financial support for marketing.

Hayley reports that more Whole Foods are being transformed into stores that exclusively fulfill online-only orders. A Chicago ""dark store"" that opened this week is the sixth Whole Foods location to shift to the format.

It is easier for dark stores to rapidly fill online orders since the grocery staff does not have to work cash registers or help customers. It also helps address workers' worries about catching the coronavirus from customers.

""By shifting to a 'dark' format, stores reduce the number of people entering the store, and therefore reduce overall exposures to employees,"" Hayley writes. ""Stores can also more easily enforce uniform safety standards, such as the usage of masks and gloves, among the people allowed inside.""

The logs will include contact information that will contribute to the state's efforts to trace potential coronavirus infections.

The daily logs are required to be saved for only 30 days.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Eight Washington counties have received the OK to move forward with the second phase of reopening, which includes allowing restaurants to offer dine-in service at 50 percent capacity, according to the Seattle Times.

Gov. Jay Inslee's rules require restaurants that reopen to keep a daily log of customers, including their names and contact information. The logs are to be kept for 30 days, when they can be used to trace coronavirus infections.

There have been 17,773 confirmed cases and 993 deaths from COVID-19 in the state, according to date from Johns Hopkins University.

As businesses in the counties cleared for limited reopening get rolling, there are 13 regulations that they must adhere to.

In addition to the log, they will also be required to move tables far enough that there is a 6-foot distance between guests at different tables.

The state is also urging restaurants to require face coverings even when guests are not seated at their tables. Bar seating and buffets are not permitted.

Restaurants are required to provide hand sanitizer to staff and guests and screen employees for signs of COVID-19 at the beginning of each shift. A COVID-19 supervisor must be assigned to enforce the site's safety plans.

Oklahoma allowed nail salons and other ""personal contact"" businesses to reopen on April 24.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The Nailspot opened its doors for the first time in weeks on May 5. Just over a week later, the beauty parlor in northeast Oklahoma is closing them again after an employee was infected with the coronavirus.

""We have received a positive COVID-19 test from a staff member who was in the salon on May 5-7,"" the Bartlesville shop announced in a May 13 post on Facebook. ""If you were in the salon on these days you could have been potentially exposed.""

It's not clear where the employee contracted the novel coronavirus, which causes the respiratory disease known as COVID-19.

""Washington County Health Department recommends that any customer that was in the salon during this time self-isolate for 14 days and if symptoms arise to contact Washington County Health Dept for further information and instruction,"" the salon wrote in its Facebook post. Nailspot plans to reopen on May 26.

Oklahoma was one of the first states to begin reopening its economy during the pandemic, with Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican, allowing salons, spas, and pet groomers to resume service on April 24.

Restaurants, gyms, and movie theaters followed suit on May 1.

In California, by contrast, authorities have refused to allow nail salons, in particular, to reopen.

""This whole thing started in the state of California, the first community spread, in a nail salon,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom claimed in a May 7 address. ""I just want to remind everybody of that and that I'm very worried about that,"" he added, though — to the consternation of salon owners — he did not provide supporting evidence.

Oklahoma's guidelines on reopening call for increased handwashing at such ""personal contact"" establishments, noting that ""[r]emaining six feet apart as in other businesses is not possible.""

The guidelines do not call for either employees or customers to wear masks, suggesting only that employees consider wearing them ""if the customer requests.""

In a May 3 post announcing its plans to reopen, the salon suggested that clients bring their own masks. ""If you do not have one, we will try to provide you with one,"" it said.

At least 284 people have died from COVID-19 in Oklahoma, according to the state government.

However, after facing backlash, some restaurants have been forced to remove the surcharges, with many raising menu prices instead.

Fresh meat prices were up 8.1% at the end of April, with experts saying they could rise by up to 20% in the coming weeks.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Angry customers are complaining about restaurants adding COVID-19 surcharges. But, owners say they are simply trying to stay in business as food costs skyrocket.

Earlier this week, a tweet showing the receipt from Kiko Japanese Steakhouse and Sushi Lounge in West Plains, Missouri, went viral after a customer noticed a ""COVID-19 surcharge.""

Many responded with outrage, questioning why the coronavirus pandemic would lead to the restaurant adding on a 5% surcharge.

According to a post on Kiko's Facebook page, the outrage continued off-line. The restaurant owner wrote that employees had been harassed due to the photo of the receipt.

""Please understand we are not doing this to take advantage of you guys!"" the post reads. ""We are doing this hoping we can adjust the surcharge weekly rather than just raise all of our prices on our menu due to increase prices from our supplier on meat, poultry, seafood & produce.""

The post questioned why people were harassing Kiko workers when meat suppliers had raised prices due to the ""broken"" meat supply chain.

Meat plants have been forced to close due to COVID-19 outbreaks in recent weeks, causing prices to skyrocket. Fresh meat prices were up 8.1% at the end of April, and experts say prices could increase by an unprecedented 20% in the coming months.

Kiko announced it would remove the surcharge, instead raising prices on all menu items.

West Plains local news station KY3 reported that two other local restaurants, Ozark Cafe and Bootleggers BBQ, had also added 5% surcharges. While many customers told KY3 they were happy to pay, Buffalo BBQ announced earlier this week it was dropping the surcharge, instead choosing to raise prices.

""We appreciate all of your support and understanding during this very unusual trying times!"" the restaurant posted on Facebook. ""Please remember we are all human, treat each other with decency and respect, and let's try to get along and get through this together!""

Purple Cow, a diner in Kingsport, Tennessee, also ended a surcharge on beef prices this week ""due to confusion."" After a burst of angry Facebook comments, the restaurant announced it would instead change the prices on individual menu items, apologizing for any inconvenience.

Goog's Pub and Grub in Holland, Michigan wrote on Facebook that it has seen remarkable support since adding a $1 ""COVID charge,"" to counteract sky-rocketing beef prices.

The parcel giant is limiting how much retailers like Kohl's and Nordstrom can ship, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal.

It shows how much store closures from the coronavirus are shifting Americans to online orders, even of nonessential items, and how it's overwhelming delivery giants.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

If your order from Nordstrom, Kohl's, Bed Bath & Beyond, DSW, or Hobby Lobby is moving at an unexpectedly sluggish pace, FedEx may be the reason.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that FedEx is so overwhelmed with online orders that it's capping shipments from some two dozen retailers until at least May 19. The companies whose orders FedEx has capped include Belk, Abercrombie & Fitch, Kohl's, Bed Bath & Beyond, Eddie Bauer, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Hobby Lobby, and DSW.

""These customers have seen significant volume growth since the spread of Covid-19,"" FedEx told Ground workers in a memo leaked to the Journal. ""In a time of already high volume growth, capping the number of packages to be picked up at these locations will limit any negative impacts to the FedEx Ground network.""

A FedEx spokesperson told Business Insider these limits are similar to what the company mandates around Christmas time, ensuring reliable service. The company is working directly with large retailers with unusually-high volume to ensure goods are getting out on time.

Some customers are directly passing their goods to a their closest-by FedEx Ground facility to bypass hub sortation, the spokesperson added. The parcel giant has also increased Sunday delivery, and, in certain locations, hiring.

Americans are now buying (nonessential) stuff online

Earlier this year, Americans shifted to buying household goods, groceries, and essential supplies online. Online sales of hand sanitizer jumped by 228% in the US during the four weeks ending on March 7, compared to the same period last year, according to retail sales tracker Nielsen.

Adobe Analytics said a 100% increase in online grocery orders in mid March drove a 25% uptick in overall online orders, compared to a period earlier in the month.

But as the government-mandated shutdowns from the coronavirus have endured, people are starting to buy more and more of those less essential goods that retailers like Nordstrom or DSW might hawk.

""It went from people trying to stock up and maybe buying a little bit more than they needed to understanding that things are OK, I can move beyond the basics of food and shelter,"" Jaimee Minney, senior vice president of marketing and public relations at market-research firm Rakuten Intelligence, told CNBC.

Rakuten Intelligence found for the first half of April, compared to the first half of March, Americans bought nearly nine times as many books, nearly three times as many toys and games, and more than twice as many sports and outdoors items. Purchases of beauty products upticked by 38%.

Meanwhile, those who are seeing their states reopen may start to consider the ensembles they may need for garden parties or weddings, suggested a recent white paper from Pinterest.

The shift to online is whelming UPS, FedEx, and Amazon

Americans have shifted to ordering more online for years, but the coronavirus pandemic is accelerating that. Sales online popped by 49% in April, according to Adobe Analytics.

And while an unexpected deluge of packages may buoy delivery companies, the FedEx shipping cap shows it's also disruptive to normal business activities. UPS and Amazon have seen disruptions, too.

UPS said it delivered 19% more packages to homebound Americans in the first three months of 2020 compared to last year. But the increase in residential over commercial deliveries ended up eroding UPS' margins.

Meanwhile, Amazon was forced to halt all third-party package shipments last month, and had to ban warehouse deliveries of nonessential goods in March.

Many experts believe that increase will stick. As a result, parcel giants must now piece together how to deliver more boxes on doorsteps than ever before.

""The No. 1 thing that we have seen is an explosion in e-commerce due to the physical store closures,"" Brie Carere, FedEx chief marketing and communications officer, told eMarketer. ""If we thought e-commerce was growing faster before, we're going to see even greater acceleration.""",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

""Mechanical Ventilation for COVID-19"" also features a discussion forum where healthcare workers can find support and discuss crucial observations, treatments, and even start regional threads.

Online learning platform edX today announced a new, completely free course on ventilator operation for non-ICU medical professionals being reassigned to ICU units to combat COVID-19.

On top of dangerous shortages of personal protective equipment, ventilators, space, and personnel, hospitals also have a critical need for proper training. ""Mechanical Ventilation for COVID-19"" is designed for non-ICU workers who will be joining the front lines in ICUs and other critical care facilities. It was designed by Dr. Susan Wilcox and Mr. Thomas Piraino of the American Association of Respiratory Care in tandem with Harvard and edX, and funded through a grant from Schmidt Futures, a philanthropic initiative co-founded by Wendy and Eric Schmidt, Google's Executive Chairman.

The entire course can be completed in two to five hours, and it's free to access. All you'll need to do is click ""enroll"".

What the course covers

The course covers the principles and physiology of invasive mechanical ventilation. Among other things, students will learn how to troubleshoot the ventilator, the specifics of ventilating patients in special circumstances like Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Obstructive Lung Disease, and how standard ventilation practices are different for COVID-19 patients.

""There are reasons to opt for early intubation for COVID-19 patients (reduces the risk of aerosolization of the virus), so we are focusing on that."" Harvard University explained in a statement. ""[The course] is more about patient monitoring and treatment options that non-specialists may not be familiar with than the mechanics of operating a machine.""

The minds behind the course

Its architects, Dr. Wilcox and Mr. Piraino, are immersed in the fight against the new coronavirus. Dr. Wilcox is Division Chief of Critical Care at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and is leading the team addressing a remarkable influx of COVID-19 patients. Mr. Piraino is the Clinical Specialist for Mechanical Ventilation for the Centre of Excellence in Mechanical Ventilation at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. ""Mechanical Ventilation for COVID-19"" was borne out of a desire to help their own teams, as well as the thousands of other healthcare workers around the globe who find themselves in exactly the same spot, especially as some cities may be nearing an apex.

A succinct, zero-fee online course is an efficient means for disseminating critical and universally useful information to as many healthcare professionals as possible, regardless of location. And that's why Dr. Wilcox and Mr. Piraino pulled the class together in just two weeks — on top of hours of emotionally and physically grueling hospital work.

""These are my heroes,"" MIT professor and edX founder and CEO Anant Agarwal told Business Insider. ""Actual heroes.""

The course could have a global impact

On top of its immediate usage, edX hopes ""Mechanical Ventilation for COVID-19"" may prove useful longterm. It has edX's standard feature of a discussion forum, in which healthcare professionals can find meaningful support amongst peers as well as a space to discuss treatments, observations, and even create trends of discussion that may be localized down to country-specific issues. The forum will be moderated by HarvardX and a medical expert who can ""pin"" the most useful questions and answers to the top of the forum for easy reference to good information.

Most edX courses are offered in English, but Agarwal told Business Insider that the company would attempt to make transcripts of ""Mechanical Ventilation for COVID-19"" available in multiple languages now that the company isn't moving at warp speed to get the course out as soon as possible.

""This effort is one of many examples of the type of community collaboration that will be required to combat the spread of COVID-19,"" Mr. Piraino said in edX's April 6 press release. ""As the entire global medical community works together to combat this pandemic, I'm proud to work with Dr. Wilcox to create a course that's universally helpful to all medical professionals in this situation.""

With many current seniors looking to defer college admission for a year, there may be less spots available for the class of 2021.

Juniors are also set to miss out on the activities that often help distinguish an application, like extracurriculars and jobs.

Low-income students may be disproportionately impacted, especially if SAT testing moves online.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The coronavirus pandemic has thrown many current and soon-to-be collegiate careers into disarray, but some of the biggest losers have been a relative afterthought so far: the juniors who haven't even applied yet.

The reason why has to do with all the seniors who, heading into an uncertain collegiate future, may opt to take a gap year instead of enrolling as planned.

""Almost all of my students who have been admitted to top-tier colleges are reconsidering their plans for this upcoming academic year, with some submitting gap year request forms to delay the start of their freshman year so that they can have the full college experience,"" college admissions consultant Christopher Rim, the CEO of Command Education, previously told Business Insider.

If schools open online in the fall, 12% of high school seniors will take a gap year, according to a survey of 1,100 current high school seniors and college students by higher-ed research and marketing firm SimpsonScarborough.

And, according to a Niche survey of 34,392 high school seniors, 7% of school seniors are considering deferring for a year or not enrolling.

For other students, deferring or not attending next year may not be much of a choice. International students, for instance, face ever-changing travel restrictions. Foreign nationals traveling from China currently aren't allowed to enter the US — and China was the largest source of international students in the 2018-2019 school year.

All of those students deferring admission — and the international students who may not be allowed to travel — will hypothetically matriculate in 2021. That means that the class of 2021 could be competing with two years' worth of high schoolers for a college spot — and the class of 2020 has already secured theirs.

Fewer college enrollments in the fall — coupled with cancelled extracurriculars and opportunities — spells trouble for juniors

""The reality is that there's going to be fewer enrollments and fewer graduates, and it's going to take time to get that back on track,"" Luke Skurman, CEO and founder of Niche, told Business Insider in an email. ""Our recent survey shows that half of high school students are rethinking their college options and 9% are considering deferring their acceptance. That, combined with 26% of college students considering transferring or taking time off could lead to a devastating fall — but opens up the possibility of a much larger than usual spring and fall 2021 enrollment size for institutions who can weather the budgetary pain of the fall.""

Of course, as Rim previously noted, it's ""unclear"" how colleges will handle gap year requests — and what students would even be able to do during a deferred year.

Further compounding the plight of the juniors is the loss of what Rim calls a ""hook"" — something that helps them stand apart in an already crowded field. For many, that comes in the form of research or extracurriculars — most of which have been cancelled due to coronavirus closures. SAT tests have been cancelled through August, meaning students will get fewer opportunities to take the test or try and raise their scores.

And lower-income students will likely be disproportionately impacted. In losing access to school buildings and libraries, they may have lost their only chance of using a quiet study space and computer. Even having one computer may not be helpful if students need to share it with a parent working from home.

The Pew Research Center found that racial minorities, rural residents, and those with lower education and income levels are less likely to have internet connectivity. That could have devastating repercussions for prospective college applicants or SAT test-takers if tests move online.

As Rim notes, many lower-income students receive SAT tutoring through public schools. If tests do resume in-person in August, they'll still be left behind by the absence of that tutoring. And, while many schools have moved to make SAT tests optional for 2021 admissions, those lower-income students who do not send in scores will find themselves going head to head with more well-resourced students who did.

All of that adds up to a bleak picture for juniors: they'll have fewer opportunities to hone the profile that colleges look for — like jobs and extracurriculars — and will find themselves competing for a reduced amount of seats.

Following is a transcript of the video.

Pooja Tewari: This is not how I thought I would end college.

Daniela Beck: My school where I'm from has really been impacted by the virus.

Emma O'Brien: We expected something to happen soon, but we didn't know it would be this drastic so quickly.

Masha Pescheryakova: When my chancellor first sent out an email telling us that UCSB's going remote, I was shocked.

Hasumi Tani: Students who were off campus during spring break were essentially told to not come back to campus, and they were ordered to either stay or go back to their permanent address.

Daniela Dwek: Last week was my last time in the facilities.

Belkis Anane: School is closed. Students were instructed to evacuate and join their families. But I cannot, because I'm an international student, and I cannot leave because of travel bans.

Hasumi: As an international student, I do not have a place to stay here, and, currently, I'm in a pretty sticky situation. My visa was rejected this week, so I literally do not have a place to go back right now. And my only choice is to stay here in America, and hopefully Georgetown.

Preet Kaur: I have chosen to stay in Santa Cruz. This is mainly because if I am exposed to the virus and I'm asymptomatic right now, I don't want to go back to my parents' house and accidentally expose my family.

Huma Manjra: When I came home yesterday, I had a lot of paranoia around, I really just sat through a flight, I really just went through two of the biggest airports, and who knows what I touched, and I had this fear that, OK, if I come home, am I gonna give anything to my parents, am I gonna give anything to my older, like, relatives, like my grandparents? Being here in LA County, where the cases are soaring, and doubling and tripling with each day, is really heightening my fear.

Genevieve Korn: I may not be able to see my parents for an extended period of time. Due to their age, they are in one of the at-risk categories, and I'm very afraid that the next time I look at my phone someone I know and love will be gone.

Belkis: Few of us are left here, but everyone I know and care about is halfway across the globe. So it is definitely very hard to go through this on your own. Housing is not a problem because I already live off campus, but I believe it is a great challenge to see all of my roommates and classmates leave and join their families while I cannot do that. It is very, very hard to be productive and work online when you are very worried for your family, who's in a very serious outbreak.

AJ Yablonsky: The whole university is now pass/fail, mandatory. You can't even opt in to take letter grade, because for people who are going home to family situations that they have to take care of a loved one who's sick with this illness or, you know, provide for their family because someone might have lost a job, they can't worry about their grades right now.

Genevieve: No one knows what's happening. But in terms of the professors and the universities, they're doing the best they can. They don't know how to cope just as much as we don't know how to cope.

Emma: It is, you know, really difficult to cater to all of the needs of students online, and I think a lot of classes will struggle. We really rely on the student to professor contact and relationship, and I just don't think that's really possible online.

Amona Saleh: Having our classes being moved to online has definitely lessened the quality of our education. Like, my science classes, all of our labs have been just canceled.

Emily Herrmann: What really stood out to me is just how radically unprepared the education system was for this switch. I know of some professors in the humanities who didn't even use email before all of this went down.

Genevieve: There are a lot of students out there that are really feeling lost right now and really need a friend. And they need someone to talk to because everything they knew was ripped away from them in a set of emails.

Preet: A lot of extracurriculars on campus have also been totally eliminated. I personally do research in a lab, and I am not allowed to go on campus currently unless I have things that I need to keep alive.

Emily: I'm an athlete on the track team. Our entire spring season got canceled, which has been really tough.

Genevieve: An organization that I'm the president of, all of our competitions were canceled, which I understand why for the safety of everyone, I agree with that they were canceled. I cried a lot when I found out that all of the work we had put in for months and months and months wasn't gonna happen this year.

Pooja: I am in my final semester of college, I was supposed to be abroad, had that taken away from me. I'm supposed to be graduating, walking in May, and there's a chance my commencement ceremony could get canceled.

AJ: Today actually we just got an email that our commencement ceremonies have been canceled. It feels surreal. Like, it's... I'm not even, like, sad. And I know I should be sad and disappointed, and I guess I am to an extent, but it doesn't feel real.

Huma: Just having to pick up, you know, leave everything, has been very, it's been a lot for me to process.

Emily: Not getting to say goodbye to friends in person has led to a lot of really emotional FaceTime calls and texting calls just thanking them for being a friend for four years. And I should have said stuff before coronavirus happened, and I'm learning that.

Elizabeth Camele: I go through periods where I feel very angry about the situation, and I also go through periods where I'm just in shock. Like, I can't believe this has happened.

Emma: So, a high moment of this experience is, you know, just the sense of community and love and support.

Daniela: Going on Facebook, different pages have been really uplifting with other students and new graduates being in the same position. And it's making me feel a lot better.

Katrina Jackson: They're just a nice dose of humor and a place for all the students that are more or less my age to come together in solidarity and just laugh about things and provide support if things are more serious.

Daniela: Like, we're all in this together, and the class of 2020 will be remembered, for sure, with all of this. And we will be celebrated one day or another, even if it's months after this pandemic.

Genevieve: It's terrible. I may not get to have a graduation ceremony. I may not get to see some of my friends again, but in the end it hopefully will be because lives were saved.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

Osmosis, a popular online medical education site founded by two former Johns Hopkins medical school students, is offering a free online course on COVID-19, led by its Chief Medical Officer, on Coursera.

""COVID-19: What You Need to Know"" is available for free. It's regularly updated with the most current information issued by the CDC, WHO, and other leading agencies and covers topics like personal protective equipment, diagnostics, and more. Healthcare professionals can earn CME credit for taking it.

The course is led by Rishi Desai, MD, MPH, a pediatric infectious disease physician with a public health background, and Mary Ales, the executive director of Interstate Postgraduate Medical Association (IPMA) for the last 17 years.

As part of the class, students will learn to recognize the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19, as well as how it spread around the world and how to apply the public health measures needed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Although probably better suited to healthcare professionals, the average person can take the course to understand how to help mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus and reduce the burden on our healthcare system.

The course breaks down into five videos (about 45 minutes total), 13 readings, and seven quizzes. It should only take students three hours to complete. Subtitles are available in English, Italian, and Spanish.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

However, this has caused challenges for students who don't have a computer or WiFi at home to keep up with schoolwork.

A recent survey from Pew Research Center found the percentage of children who likely cannot complete their schoolwork during coronavirus school closures varies by their parents' income.

More than a third of lower-income parents believe it is somewhat or very likely their children will not be able to finish their schoolwork because they don't have a computer at home.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The novel coronavirus outbreak has required children to quickly adjust to remote courses as schools closed to help mitigate the spread of the virus. However, remote learning has caused challenges for students who don't have internet access or a computer at home.

Per figures from the Department of Commerce, 14%, or 7 million, children between 6-17 years old lived in households without internet access in 2017.

That digital divide varies by region. Many cities in Alabama, Texas, and New Mexico have large shares of households without an internet subscription or a computer, based on US Census data.

The ""homework gap"" between students who lack the proper resources to complete their work and those who have these resources has been exacerbated during the coronavirus, based on new survey results from Pew Research Center.

The new Pew poll surveyed 4,917 US adults from April 7-12 about their children's ability to complete schoolwork from home.

According to the results, 22% of parents reported it is somewhat or very likely their children will have to use public WiFi during remote learning because they don't have reliable internet in their households. 21% also reported it is somewhat or very likely their children will not be able to complete their schoolwork at all because they do not have a computer.

Illustrating the ""digital divide"" between higher- and lower-income families, the results vary when separated by the respondent's income level. Lower-income parents reported higher shares of their children likely having to complete their schoolwork on a cellphone, through public WiFi, or not being able to complete their work at all compared to middle- and upper-income families.

Schools, internet providers, and states have all tried to help students get the proper resources to move to remote learning, but it has not been easy. In California, Google recently set up 100,000 broadband access points and plan to give thousands of students Chromebooks to help those in need. Even though Spectrum internet is giving 60 days of free internet access to families, people who have unpaid bills or already have an account cannot redeem this deal.

Some schools have reportedly tried other methods to ensure students can still complete schoolwork, such as people delivering schoolwork on paper to homes or using buses with WiFi signals.

Pew's survey results also indicate that 37% of Americans believe schools should be giving out computers to students during the outbreak. However, this opinion is divided along political lines. 45% of Democrats believe computers should be given to all students from the school, 17 percentage points higher than Republicans.

The partisan divide is smaller when focusing on students most in need. The difference between political parties is minimal for those who believe only students who cannot afford a computer should be given one during coronavirus, with 44% of Democrats and 42% of Republicans supporting this option.

The following three charts highlight the difficulty of completing schoolwork for children amid the coronavirus based on Pew survey respondents' income. The income levels used by Pew Research Center are based on 2018 earning figures where ""middle income is defined here as two-thirds to double the median annual income for all [Pew] panelists. Lower income falls below that range; upper income falls above it.""",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

Andrew Cuomo plans to ""reimagine"" New York's public schools when they reopen in the fall, and Bill Gates is going to help him do it.

New York's public school system, the largest in the country, has been closed since March 16 and will remain closed through the rest of the school year as the city battles the worst outbreak of the novel coronavirus in the country. Though Cuomo did not provide many details on his plans for the school system or the collaboration with the Gates Foundation, the governor did allude that major changes to New York's classrooms may be on the way.

""The old model of everybody goes and sits in a classroom and the teacher is in front of that classroom, and teaches that class, and you do that all across the city, all across the state, all these buildings, all these physical classrooms — why with all the technology you have?"" Cuomo said during his daily press briefing on the pandemic Tuesday.

The Gates Foundation told Business Insider in a statement the organization had ""committed to work with New York State on its efforts to ensure equitable access to education for its students in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" and will soon provide more details about the partnership.

The collaboration with Cuomo won't be the first time the Gates Foundation has experimented with education. The billionaire-led organization spent $1 billion and seven years working on an initiative to improve test performance for students in low-income schools by closely monitoring teacher effectiveness. A report by independent think-tank RAND reviewing all the Gateses' education efforts in the US found in 2018 that the program ultimately didn't improve test scores or drop-out rates in the long-term, Business Insider reported at the time. In some cases, the program even ""did more harm than good,"" Jay Greene, a professor of education at the University of Arkansas, wrote on Education Next.

Cuomo also outlined other forthcoming changes to the state, including closing the city's previously 24/7 subway system nightly for cleanings and initiatives to make its healthcare system more resilient.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced on Friday that schools and colleges in the state will remain closed for the rest of the academic year.

Schools will continue virtual learning for the remainder of the year, and a decision about whether summer schools will be able to open with students on the premises will be made by the end of the month, Cuomo said in his daily coronavirus update from Albany.

Schools will also need to plan for how to reopen under social-distancing guidelines in the fall or in 2021.

""We don't think it's possible to reopen schools in a way that would keep our children and students and educators safe,"" Cuomo said.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on April 11 schools in the city would remain closed for the rest of the year. Later that day, Cuomo pushed back, saying that shutting schools is ""my legal authority,"" and should be coordinated regionally across Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York City and its surrounding counties.

New York City Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza told principals in a conference call earlier this week that while the city is preparing to open schools in September, there's only a ""50-50 shot"" the buildings will actually open then, according to The New York Post.

Cuomo added that a decision on whether to extend the ""NY Pause"" business closures beyond May 15 will be made before that deadline, but did not give a more specific timeframe.

What themes are you watching in proptech?

""Any time we invest in a sector like real estate, you have to be aware of the cyclical nature of this sector and think about countercyclical.""

""One thing we've been doing to get an understanding of state of housing markets, using the time before the Great Recession and then comparing it to today just as a guide for how bad this can get assuming a real shutdown in housing market for an extended period of time.""

""Credit products are safer, we're not seeing a ton of adjustable-rate mortgages with balloon payments attached to them, not a lot of lending to low credit score borrowers, not seeing crazy debt-to-income ratios.""

""We don't think we'll see this period of mass foreclosures assuming overtime people start getting back to work, and during this interim period there's forbearance programs and alternative payment programs for any shortcakes over the next few months.""

With Fannie Mae accepting digital appraisals: ""We're seeing the largest buyers of loans willing to embrace digital tools in order to keep the market afloat.""

""I think you have to convince users of technology that it's worth getting over that educational barrier, and that a loan officer, for instance, can work more efficiently with digital tools than they can with their existing way of conducting business.""
