Former President Barack Obama criticized the federal government's coronavirus response in a thinly veiled swipe at the Trump administration during a virtual commencement address delivered to historically black colleges and universities on Saturday.

""More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they're doing,"" Obama said in his speech. ""A lot of them aren't even pretending to be in charge.""

These latest comments could ignite further tension between Obama and President Donald Trump. Obama previously criticized the Trump administration last week, when he called its Covid-19 response ""an absolute chaotic disaster"" during a private call with supporters who formerly worked for him.

Back in March, Trump blamed the country's lack of coronavirus tests on the previous administration. He has also tried to blame the Obama administration for the lack of a vaccine.

""I don't take responsibility at all,"" Trump said at a press briefing. ""Because we were given a — a set of circumstances, and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.""



One of Trump's own top health advisors, Dr. Anthony Fauci, dismissed the idea that Obama was responsible for the lack of a vaccine during a Senate hearing this week.



The White House responded to Obama's speech with a statement defending Trump's coronavirus response, claiming it had ""saved lives."" At least 88,437 Americans have died from coronavirus and more than 1.4 million have been infected, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Streamed online, Obama's speech mentioned the difficult circumstances facing graduates that stem from the pandemic, including the current economic recession. In addressing the country's 78 HBCUs, he also made reference to enduring racial inequality in the U.S., which he said can be viewed in how the pandemic is disproportionately affecting people of color as well as the recent death of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was allegedly shot by two white men in Georgia while jogging. Though Arbery died in February, the two men allegedly responsible were not arrested until May after a video that is said to depict the shooting went viral.

""We see it in the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on our communities, just as we see it when a black man goes for a jog, and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him if he doesn't submit to their questioning,"" Obama said during the speech. ""Injustice like this isn't new. What is new is that so much of your generation has woken up to the fact that the status quo needs fixing.""

Obama ended the speech on a note of optimism for the class of 2020, saying that the graduates were all ""role models"" now.

""Your participation in this democracy, your courage to stand up for what's right, your willingness to forge coalitions — these actions will speak volumes,"" he said.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

Callaghan O'Hare | Reuters

Coronavirus cases are rising in Texas as the state plans more steps to restart its devastated economy during the pandemic. After new reported cases rose by about 1,000 per day in mid-April, they started to climb in May, reaching a new single-day high of about 1,450 on Thursday. While Texans moved more freely around the state after it allowed stores and restaurants to reopen on May 1 with capacity restrictions, the figures could reflect improving testing capacity. Cases are ""definitely increasing but it's not to the point where it's overwhelming our health care system,"" said Dr. Brian Reed, professor and chair of the department of clinical sciences at the University of Houston College of Medicine.

When Texas partially rebooted its economy at the start of the month, it became the most populous state to do so up to that point. Along with the other largely Republican-led states that lifted restrictions designed to slow the pandemic in late April and early May, Texas looked to buoy a state economy wrecked after most businesses closed their doors. Texas will next allow businesses such as gyms to open on Monday with capacity limits.

The decision comes with immense risk. Experts say more freedom of movement leads to expectations of increased infections — though people's decisions to continue distancing and wear face coverings in public could limit the spread. This week, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci warned Congress that states could see ""little spikes that might turn into outbreaks"" if they restart their economies too soon. In Texas, roughly 1.8 million people have filed for jobless benefits in the last seven weeks. That comes out to 9.2% of workers covered by the state's unemployment program.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ""let the country down"" early in the nation's response to the Covid-19 crisis when it failed to scale diagnostic testing across the country, White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said on Sunday.

""Early on in this crisis the CDC, which really had the most trusted brand around the world in this space, really let the country down with the testing,"" Navarro told NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""Not only did they keep the testing within the bureaucracy, they had a bad test, and that did set us back.""

When asked whether the White House still has confidence in the CDC to lead the country's response to the pandemic, Navarro said that ""you should ask the president that question, not me.""

In April, The Washington Post reported that the CDC's coronavirus testing kits were delayed due to ""a glaring scientific breakdown"" at the agency's central lab. The error was ""devastating to the country"" and ""really a terrible black mark on the CDC,"" James Le Duc, a former CDC officer, told The Post.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration later confirmed with CNBC that the ""CDC did not manufacture its test consistent with its own protocol,"" according to a spokeswoman. The agency ""was not able to determine from information provided by the CDC whether the test issues were due to a design or manufacturing issue,"" the spokeswoman said.

Speaking with CBS on Sunday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the CDC, which is an agency under HHS, has had to ""literally build this from the ground up"" and that it was the private sector's role to expand the CDC-developed test. He said the initial contaminated tests that the CDC developed prevented some of the scale up ""for a couple of weeks.""

In response to Navarro's comments, Azar said that he believes the CDC didn't let the country down and has always had the critical role of getting the private sector to the table.

""That was never going to be the backbone of testing, of broad, mass testing, in the United States,"" Azar told CBS, saying that was the role of companies like Abbott Laboratories, Roche and Thermo Fischer.

Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, a CNBC contributor who sits on the boards of Pfizer and biotech company Illumina, told CBS on Sunday that even if the CDC had rolled out its early test perfectly, there still wouldn't have been enough diagnostic testing in the nation.

Azar told CNN on Sunday that the U.S. is now conducting more than 300,000 tests per day and approximately 10 million tests total. Although that's still a small portion of the country's population of approximately 328 million people.

""What needed to happen was someone needed to pick up the phone and call the CEOs of LabCorp and Quest and the other big labs probably sometime in January or at least in early February,"" Gottlieb said. He said that person would've been either Azar or FDA Commissioner Stephan Hahn.

""If they'd ask the CEOs to do that, I'm willing to bet they would've done it and you would've got the big labs in the game,"" Gottlieb said.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

The biggest one for many Americans is: When will life go back to normal? And, what will that new normal even look like? As summer approaches, you may find yourself longing for events that you would typically look forward to, such as vacations, holidays or time spent with your family. On social media, people who are currently sheltering in place expressed that it's challenging to not have anything to look forward to or anticipate. Without these usual benchmarks, you might feel off or sad. ""Uncertainty doesn't sit well,"" Kevin Antshel, clinical psychologist and director of the clinical psychology program at Syracuse University tells CNBC Make It. Here's how to cope with not knowing what's coming next.

Why humans hate the unknown

""The fear of the unknown is possibly the most fundamental fear of human beings,"" Antshel says. From an evolutionary perspective, humans have been able to survive because we're able to plan. We're socialized from childhood to believe that ""there's a predictable universe"" and order in which things should happen, Antshel says. ""Extraordinarily high levels of uncertainty are really against how we've advanced as human beings,"" he says. For example, under normal circumstances, you'd be able to assemble the resources necessary to achieve a plan, and then go implement it. ""When things don't make sense, or they run counter to what it typically is, then we experience these high levels of negative feelings,"" Antshel says.

What uncertainty feels like

We're hand-wired to avoid uncertainty, because it makes us feel lots of negative emotions, Antshel says. The ""vast majority"" of people are experiencing some level of emotional distress or unpleasant emotions during this time, he says. These feelings all come back to uncertainty. ""Fear and anxiety really run hand-in-hand: The more things are uncertain, the more we're going to fear, and the more we fear things, the more we are anxious,"" he says. While planning for post-pandemic life can feel comforting, thinking too much about the future can also increase our anxious thoughts. The more prolonged anxiety is, the more likely it is to manifest itself as depression, which is characterized by a loss of interest in things, hopelessness and helplessness, he says. It can feel like this difficult period will be going on forever, with no end in sight. On top of this, you might find that you're mourning the loss of events that you were anticipating, such as weddings, big work projects or graduation.

Some events may not survive the pandemic,https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104561687-London_Marathon.jpg?v=1578673377,"We asked experts in various fields for their best predictions on what the world will look like when the coronavirus pandemic finally recedes. In this segment of our series, ""The Next Normal,"" we examine what happens to the highly popular running industry as thousands of races have been cancelled, and what races of the future might look like. *** Tens of thousands of runners herded into corrals, packed shoulder-to-shoulder. Nervous energy and excitement filling the air. And then the ""pop"" of the gun, signaling that the race has begun, and wave after wave of runners breaking across the starting line. This is the scene at the start of the world's largest marathons, which in some cases have upwards of 40,000 participants. These races are big-ticket events that attract runners from around the globe along with their families and fans, while generating hundreds of millions of dollars for their host cities. But in the face of the coronavirus, the fate of road racing — like so many other sports — remains uncertain. As running has grown in popularity, local clubs have popped up around the country, and there are now roughly 35,000 races each year in the U.S. alone, data from industry trade group Running USA shows. More than 44 million people in the U.S. identify as a runner, and 17.6 million people crossed the finish line in U.S. races in 2019. With all races cancelled for the time being, billions of dollars are at stake. The biggest marathons – from Boston to Chicago to London to Tokyo – inject hundreds of millions of dollars into local economies. The most recent analysis of the TCS New York City Marathon, for example, found that the race's economic impact topped $400 million.

These marathons are the largest in the world and attract international runners, but most race organizers in the U.S. are small businesses that depend on registration fees for as much as 95% of their revenue. And with no clear timeframe for when road racing will again be permitted, thousands of jobs are on the line. The effects will be compounded throughout the race ecosystem — timers, t-shirt makers, medal engravers, and, of course, the hotels and restaurants that the athletes and their fans patronize. With runners sidelined, organizations like Ironman and New York Road Runners are offering virtual races as the industry grapples with what events could look like as the pandemic rages on. Some are hopeful that precautionary measures, such as fewer participants and staggered start times, might make races — especially shorter 5Ks — possible, while others say large-scale races are unlikely until there's a vaccine. ""I don't know the overall impact … but it's pretty devastating to our sport for sure,"" said Bart Yasso, former chief running officer for Runner's World, and one of the few people to have run a marathon on all seven continents. ""A lot of these event companies are going to really be hurt by this, and some of these smaller races just aren't going to survive.""

Races of the future

Looking towards the future, it's not only the sheer size of these races, of course, that poses a health risk, but the physical activity itself. Among other things, heavy and fast breathing out of one's mouth means that virus-transmitting droplets can travel further than just six feet according to Dr. Cordelia Carter, an orthopedic surgeon and director of the Center for Women's Sports Health at NYU Langone. A lot depends, of course, on the trajectory of the virus over the next few months. While cities have the final say over whether or not events can take place, racing companies are already mapping out what the future might look like. Ironman Group CEO Andrew Messick said the company is focusing on five broad elements: Density reduction, such as fewer race participants

Minimizing touch points with athletes throughout the race

Education and training to make sure people understand best practices

Promoting self-reliance, such as having athletes carry their own nutrition

Increasing pre-race screening ""What we're going to continue to do, is to work very closely with our communities … when they're ready for us to come back, our goal is to be able to deliver an event that's going to fit within whatever parameters they decide is appropriate for their community,"" Messick said. Ironman Group is the largest organizer of mass sporting events in the world, with more than 235 races — including the popular Rock 'n' Roll series — across 55 countries.

Dr. Brett Toresdahl, a primary sports medicine physician at Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, said that other precautions could include taking participants' temperatures when they enter corrals — where runners are grouped at the starting line — and limiting the size of the corrals from hundreds or thousands of people to just dozens. Toresdahl, who is a team physician for US Biathlon and Rugby United New York, added that the nature of the virus itself makes it especially challenging due to the number of asymptomatic cases. On Thursday, New York Road Runners said that it had cancelled all races through August 15, but that the TCS New York City Marathon – the largest in the world – is still scheduled for November 1. NYRR president and CEO Michael Capiraso said that the organization is modelling ways to minimize contact throughout the race — such as at water stations — and that a lot will be learned in the coming months as smaller races take place. ""Between now and the marathon there's a lot of time to explore with smaller races and smaller events and see what else is happening out there,"" he said. ""Lots of people are sharing things across the industry because everyone is very eager to get back.""

Economic impact

Road racing has grown into a multi-billion dollar industry, and the world's largest marathons have a significant economic impact on cities across the globe.

The 2018 Bank of America Chicago Marathon brought in $378 million for the city, while the most recent analysis of the NYC marathon in 2014 showed that it generated $415 million for New York. The 2019 Boston Marathon injected in excess of $200 million into the local economy, and the most recent study of the Virgin Money London Marathon in 2015 showed an economic benefit of £128 million, or about $155.8 million. These highly popular events will continue to attract participants for years to come, but smaller races might not fare as well. Running USA CEO Rich Harshbarger noted that the majority of race organizers in the country are small businesses that employ an average of eight people, with between 40% and 95% of annual revenue coming in from race fees. In addition to full-time employees, companies typically partner with contractors for each event. ""Everybody that's in the race business relies on dozens, if not hundreds, of small companies that are largely owner-operated,"" Ironman's Messick said. As race cancellations build, Harshbarger said the industry is ""suffering tremendously"" and that, since it has no league or players association, it's sometimes overlooked. For this reason over 500 endurance event operators across the country — including Ironman and Running USA — banded together in April to launch the Endurance Sports Coalition, which is seeking longer-term funding for event operators. Virtually every business is feeling the impacts of the virus, but unlike restaurants, for instance, that can pivot to take-out and delivery options, race providers only have one revenue stream.

""Without specifically targeted help from the federal government, endurance sports may not survive the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the organization's website says. ""Many events with long and proud histories do not have the resources to weather this storm and will not be able to ramp up again next year.""

What happens next?

With races cancelled, organizations are seeking to stay connected with athletes by taking the course virtual. Athletes run the race distance on their own during a set time period, and then simply upload their results. New York Road Runner's virtual Brooklyn half marathon in May had more than 10,000 participants. Nearly 40,000 people have registered to compete in the first three Rock 'n' Roll virtual races, while 125,000 athletes have signed up for the first six Ironman virtual races.

The city is now testing people who are asymptomatic, and authorities say the tests are voluntary. The testing identified 28 new asymptomatic carriers and no cases with symptoms, authorities said.

Despite the continued jump in cases and deaths, India is expected to ease some lockdown measures starting Monday. The country's nationwide lockdown started in late March and has since been extended twice. — Yen Nee Lee

11:45 am: Thailand reopens shopping malls, restaurants as new cases fall

Thailand eased restrictions further this weekend by allowing more businesses and activities to resume, including department stores, restaurants and some sporting facilities. The government also shortened the nationwide curfew by one hour. The nighttime curfew will now run from 11 p.m. — instead of 10 p.m. previously — until 4 a.m. the next day. But other businesses and activities such as cinemas and amusement parks remain closed, while the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand extended its ban on all international passengers into the country until the end of June. The number of new daily cases in Thailand has slowed to a trickle this month. As of Saturday, the Southeast Asian country has reported 3,025 confirmed infections and 56 deaths, according to the Department of Disease Control. — Yen Nee Lee

10:55 am: South Korea confirms 13 more cases

South Korea reported 13 new confirmed coronavirus cases, bringing its tally to 11,050, according to the latest data by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of those, five cases were detected in Seoul, where a new cluster of infections linked to several nightclubs and bars was recently found. Authorities have been tracking down the roughly 5,500 people that visited the affected nightlife spots between April 24 and May 6 — more than a thousand of them still out of contact, according to Yonhap News Agency. The number of coronavirus-related deaths in South Korea remained at 262 after KCDC reported no additional fatalities in the past day. — Yen Nee Lee

10:10 am: Mexico's death toll cross 5,000

Mexico's health ministry said there were another 278 coronavirus-related fatalities, taking the country's death toll to 5,045 since the outbreak, reported Reuters. Mexico's Covid-19 death rate is higher compared to the global average because pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes, hybertension and obesity are more widespread among the population, according to the report. The country's cumulative confirmed cases jumped by 2,112 to 47,144, said the report. — Yen Nee Lee

9:25 am: China reports 5 new cases, no additional deaths

China's National Health Commission said there were five new coronavirus cases in the past day. Two of those cases were ""imported,"" while the remaining three were detected in the northeastern province of Jilin, said NHC. That brings the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China to 82,947, according to the commission. The country's death toll remained at 4,634, said NHC. Jilin province has experienced a resurgence in cases. Last week, Shulan — a city in the province — reported new cases for the first time in more than 70 days. That prompted authorities to reinstate some restrictions, such as closing sporting facilities and libraries, and halting some train services. — Yen Nee Lee

Twenty million children attend camps in the U.S. every summer, fueling the $18 billion camp industry. With summer just a little more than a month away, camp directors are still deciding if it's safe for camps to operate amid the coronavirus pandemic. And parents are equally concerned. On Thursday the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said camps should not reopen unless they are able to implement coronavirus screening protocols, evaluating employees and children daily for symptoms and potential past exposures to Covid-19. But compliance with the CDC direction will depend on whether states adopt the decision tools into their own local policies — and whether the Trump administration supports and promotes the agency's guidelines. State and local guidance is expected to be provided as early as next week. According to Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, we are ""still in the early innings"" of the coronavirus crisis, but if it were up to him, he would choose to send his kids to a sleepaway camp over a day camp. At CNBC's Healthy Returns virtual conference on Tuesday, Gottlieb expressed that ""sleepaway camps have the potential to create a protective bubble that is easier to do than at day camps."" That's because at day camps the campers and staff are constantly coming and going, which could increase the risk of exposure to the infectious disease.

But Helene Drobenare, a social worker and the executive director of Camp Young Judaea Sprout Camps in New York, said it's a misnomer that any camp can provide a bubble against Covid-19. ""A bubble is to assume that when you close the gate, that means you can't get mail, you can't get a milk delivery, you can't send anybody in or out to get any kind of food or supplies, and it means you won't have any day workers,"" she said. ""We probably could do a bubble for a very short time period, maybe a few days. I think a bubble is what we want to believe and it's what our hearts want and that's what we want for our children — a place that will be 100% safe and the disease won't find them there. But in my opinion, I don't think overnight camp can give that coverage. Nowhere in the world today could give that coverage. If it could, we wouldn't be where we are."" Camp Young Judaea has two day camps — one in Brooklyn and one in Croton-on-Hudson — as well as an overnight camp in the Hudson Valley. Collectively, about 750 campers attend the camps, which are considered to be in the coronavirus epicenter.

Jay Jacobs, executive director of Timber Lake Camps, told CNBC's John Fortt on ""Squawk Alley"" last week that he is hopeful his camps will run as planned this summer, claiming that there are ways to ensure a protected environment, especially in sleepaway, or residential, camps. TLC Camps is comprised of seven camps located in Long Island, the Catskill region of New York and northeastern Pennsylvania. His camps serve about 3,000 children. ""You can test your staff before they come to camp. You can test your campers before they come to camp and only accept those with negative tests, so you've already locked out Covid-19, at least initially,"" he said. ""Remember, many resident camps are in rural communities where the prevalence of the virus is not as great as down in the cities or suburbs.""

Quarantine's effect on kids' mental health

Some mental health experts believe that the harmful effect of kids in indefinite quarantine outweigh the risk of coronavirus exposure at camp. ""The need for connection is as fundamental a need as our need for food, oxygen and shelter, says humanistic psychologist Dr. Scott Barry Kaufman, author of ""Transcend: The New Science of Self-Actualization."" ""Of course, we must make sure that all children are protected from exposure to the coronavirus, but this protection shouldn't come at the expense of opportunities for shared play, connection and friendship. The right balance of our needs is necessary to become a fully functioning human being.""

But Denise Daniels, a pediatric oncology nurse and child development expert, says that while she has empathy for the kids hoping to attend summer camp, she has trepidation about them sleeping in bunk beds, sharing showers, making crafts and having meals together on those long wooden tables in the food pavilion. ""I understand what a critical time this is for the mental health and well-being of families after being on lockdown, adhering to social distancing and upholding the endless health rituals of washing hands, coughing and sneezing in elbows, wearing masks and staying six feet apart,"" she says. ""Lots of kids will be attending virtual summer camps this year, and unbelievably, there are tons of fun activities kids can do outside on Zoom or Skype."" Camp Young Judaea's Drobenare agrees. ""For the first time, they are creating relationships through a screen and not through touch or eye contact, but I believe that we have to deal the cards that are in front of us right now,"" she said. ""If you are asking me to choose between a disease that I'm not sure if it will cause death, or to help these kids somehow build relationships and find hope through a screen, then I think we have to do that and be as creative as we can until we can get through this. It's not the optimal situation, but I think life outweighs anything else in this type of risk.""

The American Camp Association, a community of camp professionals that has been in existence for over 100 years, is weighing the guidance from the CDC, along with rules and guidance from the state boards of health and other experts, to help individual camps make the decision as to whether they think they should operate camp this summer and if they could do so subject to the CDC's and state's rules. The ACA's mission is to ensure the quality of its 3,100 member camps across the U.S., which serves more than 10 million of the 20 million children who attend camps every summer across America. ""There's two words in social distance,"" ACA CEO Tom Rosenberg told CNBC's Scott Wapner on ""The Path Forward"" last week. ""First, as parents, we had to help our kids learn to distance themselves from their friends, and now as parents we are watching our kids starve themselves socially and emotionally from their own identity."" Rosenberg is a leading voice for young people today, advancing the public's understanding of the value of camp for everyone as an essential developmental and educational experience.

Heading off to Camp Virtual

While the ACA CEO said he is hopeful camps will be open this summer — not only for the survival of the camp industry but also so kids can begin to reconnect — he understands there is a very real possibility that camp may look very different in 2020. ""I expect to see all kinds of summer experiences. Like a continuum of camp. So this summer, camp will look different. It may even be virtual for some. But those connections are going to happen, and children will have joyful experiences that help them learn and grow with each other,"" said Rosenberg. ""Before the pandemic even began, Gen Z kids really had skyrocketing depression and anxiety. And then comes Covid 19. ... We are trying to create connections to help them reconnect with each other, to reconnect with adults and to themselves.""

As soon as shelter-in-place orders went into effect in the New York area, Drobenare says she closed Camp Young Judaea and in under two weeks pivoted to create Sprout@Home, a menu of activities including book clubs, yoga classes and online bunk meetups with a counselor. ""We may not be able to be together physically today, but we could be together emotionally and spiritually still,"" said Drobenare, who added that a final decision will be made by the end of the month as to whether or not they will run the camps this summer.

Coronavirus-related cases in youth

Headlines swirling the last several weeks about coronavirus-related cases rising among youth is also top of mind for parents and camp directors. To date at least 110 cases have been reported in New York, and three young people — ages 5, 7 and 18 — have died. Doctors believe the illness — which the CDC now calls multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C — has been reported in at least 19 states and Washington, D.C. It was previously referred to as pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome.

The condition appears to be a post-viral syndrome caused by a delayed immune system response to the coronavirus that can lead to blood vessel inflammation. The inflammatory disease is similar to Kawasaki disease, an illness most common in young children that causes high fever and swelling in blood vessels. Children may also develop a rash and experience abdominal pain and vomiting. Most of the kids who have developed the condition are between 5 and 9 years old and have either tested positive for coronavirus or were found to have antibodies, suggesting that they'd previously been infected.

A hopeful decline in late summer

Gottlieb is more optimistic about easing lockdown guidelines in late summer months. When the former FDA commissioner was asked by CNBC's Tyler Mathisen at the virtual conference if he would let his children swim at a public swimming pool or swim club this summer, he did not commit to an answer but said, ""Hopefully there's going to be a seasonal effect here and we are going to see cases decline in July or August and we can all take a little breather in the summer."" Nevertheless, he is still very concerned about the fall as the virus settles into a more ""seasonal pattern."" ""If you want to be optimistic, last week we had an average of around 27,000 new cases a day and 1,700 deaths. That's down from about 30,000 cases and 2,000 deaths. But it's still too early to tell."" To date the U.S. has nearly 1.46 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 and at least 87,603 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Globally, the death toll has now surpassed 300,000.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

Instead, customers are getting used to new grocery store fixtures: Mask-wearing employees, plexiglass barriers at cash registers, one-way aisles and antibacterial wipe dispensers. Some of those will become the norm. Others will fade away as coronavirus cases decline. But many analysts predict the pandemic will change how customers stock their fridges and pantries and shape their expectations in the months or years ahead. Here's a round-up of five changes sparked by the pandemic:

No touching, please

Customers are more squeamish about germs — and that could linger. Grocers and other retailers have touted new and expanded contactless approaches to shop or check out. Walmart, for example, added a new feature to its smartphone app that allows customers to scan a QR code instead of touching a screen at the cash register. Other apps, such as Apple Pay and Google Pay, also allow customers to skip the credit card reader. With curbside pickup, customers can pop the trunk instead of going into stores. Some retailers have waived the need for a signature when people pick up groceries or get a delivery to their home. Some customers are opting for prepackaged goods, as they skip the deli counter and other parts of the store with additional food handling, said Jill Standish, Accenture's global head of retail. She said the grab-and-go items also shorten shoppers' time in stores, another common preference. Those approaches may stick because of their convenience, along with heightened safety.

'Go local' trend on steroids

Long before the pandemic, customers bought fruits and vegetables at farmers markets and supported local businesses, such as cheese shops. The pandemic is accelerating that trend, said Scott McKenzie, Nielsen's head of global intelligence. Now, he said, people gravitate even more to products grown or made closer to home. They're thinking about the long distances that produce, meat and other foods may travel and the borders they may cross before arriving to their kitchen table — and the many people who may touch them along the way. That's driving more interest in subscriptions to farm boxes and items with ""a shorter supply chain,"" McKenzie said. ""I call this the phenomenon of buying milk from cows you can see,"" he said.

Shift to online shopping accelerates

Grocery shoppers have downloaded new grocery apps and tried new online services. Those discoveries have shaken up habits and could lead to a meaningful shift in an industry that's been slow to go digital. Customers have used third-party delivery services, such as Instacart, FreshDirect and Target-owned Shipt, to get groceries. They've also ordered online and used curbside or in-store pickup at Walmart and Target. Only about 3% or 4% of grocery spending in the U.S. was online before the coronavirus outbreak, according to research by consulting firm Bain & Company. That could increase to between 5% and 10% after it, said Steve Caine, a retail expert and partner for the firm.

A personal touch by 'pickers'

Grocers will look for creative ways to strengthen relationships with customers and entice them to add more to their virtual baskets, as more customers shop online in addition to in-store. Employees who fulfill and bag online orders at stores — often called pickers or shoppers — will become increasingly important and could become a competitive advantage for retailers, said Eiko Kawano, a group experience director for digital consulting firm, Publicis Sapient. Grocers may use the employees as brand ambassadors and suggestive sellers, she said. Stores could ask pickers to upload a photo or a brief profile and allow customers to rate the pickers like Uber and Lyft drivers. Through a combination of personal relationships and algorithms, the shopper or picker could personalize customers' orders by recommending an item. And they could nudge customers towards higher margin items and discretionary purchases, too.

Our essential workers are dying.

Just this week, we learned of three more Amazon warehouse workers who have died due to Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths to seven. Unofficial tallies, mostly tracked by concerned Amazon employees who receive text message alerts whenever one of their colleagues catches the coronavirus, peg the total number of cases at 900 or more.

There could easily be more deaths and infections within Amazon's walls, but the company has declined to disclose the impact the pandemic has had on its employees. Instead, Amazon has only verified deaths when they're dug up by members of the media, leaving us with a fuzzy picture at best as to how dangerous this work actually is.

Amazon disagrees. In an interview with ""60 Minutes"" on May 10, Amazon's operations boss David Clark said disclosing the number of ""isn't particularly useful,"" and instead said the focus should be on the rate of cases relative to the number of workers in a warehouse and the communities in which they live. Amazon hasn't disclosed that rate either.

Amazon should release the number of infections and deaths among its workforce, or, at the very least, figures that show the rate of the infections inside its warehouses.

Our notion of an ""essential worker"" has dramatically changed since the start of the pandemic. It's not just doctors, nurses, police officers, firefighters and members of the military. In the time of the coronavirus, the definition has expanded to include sanitation workers, grocery store clerks, food-delivery workers and warehouse workers who ship goods ordered online.

Over the last few months, we've called these workers heroes. We've asked them to show up to work amid a deadly pandemic that has already killed at least 86,000 people and affected at least 1.4 million in the U.S. They're working in crowded buildings, behind checkout counters shielded with plexiglass and in hotspots like New York City where the virus continues to spread and kill hundreds of people per day.

We're asking them to do it all without a clear picture of just how dangerous the work actually is. We're asking them to choose between no paycheck and putting their lives at risk. We're asking them to do all this just to keep the basic standard of living we've become accustomed to humming as a virus ravages the country.

If Amazon disclosed its infection and death data, it would provide valuable insight not just to workers who need to make decisions about their paychecks and health, but also to employers grappling with the same issues as Amazon.

As other businesses slowly begin to open again across the country, they'll need all the help they can get to make sure they're protecting their workers and customers, just like the essential businesses who have been operating through the pandemic have done. There are lessons to learn, but those lessons become more difficult without the data.

Amazon's biggest rival in retail, Walmart, also has a slew of reported Covid-19 cases and deaths, but has routinely declined to disclose its own data and faces a wrongful death lawsuit from the family of one of its employees who died from the coronavirus. Other horror stories have cropped up in essential businesses from Tyson meat plants to grocery store chains like Costco and Kroger that are grappling with long lines and customers angry over social distancing rules.

Amazon has proven it can be a leader. For example, in October 2018, Amazon announced it would raise its minimum wage to $15 per hour. But Amazon went further than just raising wages. It also said it would advocate to bring the federal minimum wage up to the same standard, and CEO Jeff Bezos dared other large employers to do the same.

""We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead,"" Bezos said in a statement at the time. ""We're excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us.""

Now it's time for Amazon to lead again. It's an icon of American industry, like General Electric and General Motors were decades ago. It's the company many businesses admire and look to for guidance. Through its innovation and relentless drive, Amazon has earned the burden of setting the standard for how business works in this country.

So far, Amazon has done a great job talking about the safety measures it has taken to protect its warehouse workers. It provides regular updates on its dedicated Covid-19 blog, which reads like a template for just about any large business grappling with how to safely operate during the pandemic. Face masks. Temperature checks. Social distancing. Hand sanitzer. Gloves. And so on. Amazon should be commended for moving as rapidly as it could to implement these changes throughout its sprawling logistics network. That's no small feat.

On top of that, Amazon said it plans to reinvest all of its profits this quarter -- an estimated $4 billion -- into its Covid-19 response. Hundreds of millions of dollars of that will go towards its own development of Covid-19 tests, a key to getting all of its employees safely back to work. It said it could spend $1 billion on testing alone this year. Compare that to the White House's response to the testing shortage.

Workers are scared, even as they do important work for pay that doesn't match up to the risk they're taking. Amazon has the opportunity to shine light on just how dangerous this work is by being the first major important to disclose its worker death and infection counts.

Hopefully others would then follow Amazon's lead.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

Caceres caught coronavirus and was in a coma for 11 days. Spencer Kimball | CNBC

Josue Caceres remembers waking up in a hospital bed. He tried to get up and go to the bathroom, but he was so weak he fell and hit his head.



When he woke up from the fall, the doctor told him he had caught Covid-19, had gone into a coma for 11 days and was placed on a ventilator. Although his family has a history of high blood pressure, the 25-year-old Caceres is otherwise healthy. He still doesn't know how he caught the virus.



""I hardly went outside — I was taking this quarantine very serious,"" Caceres said. ""The few times I went out I had masks and gloves.""



It started in late March when Caceres started to feel ill. He thought it was the flu and he just needed rest. But his mother, Dorka, became concerned when he started to complain of chest pain. She thought something might be wrong with his heart and decided to call 911. The EMT checked Caceres, said his heart was fine and decided against taking him to the hospital because he didn't display symptoms of the virus. But his condition quickly deteriorated after the EMT visit as he started experiencing severe shortness of breath. ""I couldn't breathe — I was literally just gasping for air,"" Caceres said. "" I would just take a few steps and it felt like I ran a marathon."" His mother and brother saw how ill he suddenly looked and called the ambulance again. That's around the time Caceres went unconscious. His family wasn't able to visit him while he was hospitalized and intubated due to protocols to prevent the virus from spreading. Caceres' lungs and kidneys weren't functioning properly. During those 11 days, his mother Dorka feared for his life and would call the hospital constantly to check on his condition.



""I truly feel like if I was alone I probably would have died because I wasn't aware of anything — I couldn't do anything,"" Caceres said.

'It just hit home'

Caceres lives in the Bronx, one of the hardest-hit boroughs in the hardest-hit city in the U.S. More than 42,000 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the Bronx and at least 3,293 have died from Covid-19 as of Friday. Every day brings more death and infections.



People are fighting for their lives and their livelihoods as the virus rips through the borough and businesses deemed nonessential by the state have remained closed for eight weeks now in an effort to contain the epidemic. The Bronx is particularly vulnerable to the public health and economic crises triggered by the virus. The borough has the lowest health outcomes in New York state and has high rates of asthma and diabetes. The number of people living in poverty is the highest in New York City at 27%. Amaurys Grullon, 27, was tired of the stereotypes he always heard about his home when growing up. In 2016, Grullon founded a business called Bronx Native to showcase the borough's culture and creativity. He asked Caceres, his childhood friend, to join the business as brand manager and help run the store.

""For me the Bronx is the most beautiful place on Earth — I wanted to change the narrative,"" Grullon said. The store, located in Mott Haven, sells apparel, accessories and acts as community space to the neighborhood, hosting everything from comedy to financial literacy classes. Business was good until the pandemic, Grullon said. They had to close the shop's doors when the state declared their business nonessential, and sales fell 50% even as the store has ramped up its online business to compensate, Grullon said. Then, as the business was in turmoil, Caceres caught the virus.



Grullon knew something was wrong when Caceres wasn't responding to his messages. He contacted Caceres' mother, who told him his friend had fallen into a coma.



""When I heard that news — it's when I really realized this is serious,"" Grullon said. ""Josue is a young kid, 25 — younger than me. It just hit home, and when things hit home they hit differently.""

'We're in a very difficult position'

Caceres' lungs started responding, his condition started to improve and he was taken off intubation. He survived the virus and is healthy now, but it's unclear if Bronx Native will survive the shutdown. Grullon has applied for a small business loan through the federal Paycheck Protection Program to help keep the store afloat. Grullon originally tried to apply through Chase, but he heard from other business owners he might have a better shot with a smaller community bank. He applied at Ponce Bank and also through PayPal. Unlike Chase, neither Ponce nor Paypal require applicants to have existing accounts, which has made it easier for many small businesses to apply.



Understanding the program and its rules, navigating the application and getting the right documents together in such a short time was frustrating. Grullon said he was totally in the dark when he first started looking into applying for funding a month ago. Bronx Native has since been approved for a $25,000 loan through Paypal. Small businesses like Bronx Native initially struggled to get their applications processed amid the confusion and technical problems that plagued the rollout of the program, while a number of publicly traded companies who were clients of big banks were approved for loans before the first round of money ran out.



When the program reopened with more funding, $30 billion was set aside for smaller lenders. The idea was to get money to underserved communities and minority business owners. The $30 billion ran out in less than two days, according to Kenneth Kelly, chairman of the National Bankers Association, which represents minority-owned banks.

A government watchdog found minority and women-owned businesses may not have received loans because the Small Business Administration did not tell lenders to prioritize underserved communities as called for under the law.



Lisa Sorin, president of the Bronx Chamber of Commerce, said few businesses in the borough received money during the first round of lending. The problem, Sorin said, is the Paycheck Protection Program defines a small business as 500 or fewer employees. But in the Bronx most businesses have fewer than 10 employees, which means they are competing with much larger and better equipped companies for money.



More businesses in the Bronx started to get funding when the program set aside money for smaller banks, Sorin said, but it's still not enough to meet the needs of the 23,000 businesses in the borough. Sorin is concerned the pandemic will force scores of businesses to close for good, ending a period of progress in which unemployment had fallen to historic lows and the number of businesses reached a four-decade high.



Many business districts in the Bronx are projecting retail vacancy rates as high as 50% by August, according to Michael Brady, executive director of the Third Avenue Business Improvement District. ""That's taking us back to the mid-'90s when the vacancy rate was out of control,"" Sorin said, ""and that's a very scary position to be in when we were in an upward curve for the borough."" Grullon said he can breathe a little easier now that he received funding after weeks of trying, but getting approved brings its own challenges. PPP loans are turned into grants if borrowers use 75% of the money for payroll among other conditions, one reason why the loans are in such high demand. Grullon wants to make sure he has a plan in place to meet those guidelines so he doesn't end up with a more than $1,300 monthly loan payment on top of his other costs. When he was still uncertain if funding would come through, Grullon started a GoFundMe campaign with a goal to raise $20,000 to help pay rent, utilities and vendors. He said the community has been supportive, and the GoFundMe money acts as a cushion during uncertain times.



""We are in a very difficult position right now because it's a very uncertain time,"" Grullon said. ""Everyday we're trying to figure out ways to adapt.""

'This was an older person's disease'

The crisis hit home for Noelle Santos when she heard that Caceres, her friend, was in a coma. Santos owns The Lit. Bar, a bookstore and bar, around the corner from Bronx Native.



""We were told this was an older person's disease and the younger people were just keeping the older safe,"" Santos said. ""Once our friend in his mid-20s got sick and he was in a coma for 11 days fighting for his life — that really shook us up."" Santos knew the situation was getting serious before Caceres fell ill. She voluntarily closed The Lit. Bar a few days before the state ordered nonessential businesses to do so. Santos was worried about the health and safety of her customers after the state first told businesses to operate at reduced capacity to help control the outbreak.



""They were leaving it up to me to protect people and I didn't feel confident in my ability to do that,"" she said.

""The phenomenon of Granny working in McDonald's really started to ramp up,"" said Ghilarducci, who leads the Retirement Equity Lab at The New School in New York.

Yet, as bad as it was then, she sees the current Covid-19 recession making life even more uncertain and even more difficult for those in their 50s, 60s and 70s. By her calculations, the pandemic will force another 3.1 million older workers into poverty in their retirement, with many forced to choose between their health and their need for a paycheck.

CNBC spoke with Ghilarducci about why older Americans are particularly vulnerable to this recession, and what the pandemic's fallout has revealed to us about the risks of our current retirement system.

The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

CNBC: How do you see this recession impacting older workers and retirement differently than previous recessions?

Teresa Ghilarducci: The unemployment rate. It's going up among older workers faster than any other group, except for the very young. They probably won't get back into the labor force, or it'll take them a long time to get another job. That means they'll draw down on their retirement savings, they may go into debt and they'll also apply for Social Security earlier, forgoing increased benefits. As a result, people who are middle-class workers now will be poor or near-poor retirees for the rest of their lives.

CNBC: Why are so many older Americans being thrown out of work during the pandemic?

TG: It has to do with the jobs they were in. Education and health care, health care that wasn't involved with Covid care: dentist offices, optometrist offices, home health care, these are jobs that were all lost in the last couple of months and were disproportionately filled by older workers, and older women, by the way. Women have been harder hit than men in the Covid recession, and older women especially.

CNBC: Why is it harder for older workers who've lost their jobs to get re-hired than it is for younger workers? And how could the pandemic exacerbate the problem?

TG: There's the sense that older workers don't have the skills or potential that younger workers have and, in most cases, that's an irrational, discriminatory prejudice. But in this recession, caused by the pandemic, there may be a rational basis for the age discrimination. Older workers coming back to work may face much worse health hazards, and they will need special accommodations by their employers. The employer of an older worker may be concerned about their health and the liability associated with not providing a safe working place.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

Andrew Cuomo said that 66% of new hospitalizations in New York for Covid-19 were people who had been staying home. ""This is a surprise: Overwhelmingly, the people were at home,"" Cuomo said. ""We thought maybe they were taking public transportation, and we've taken special precautions on public transportation, but actually no, because these people were literally at home."" The ""shocking"" data came from a survey of more than 100 New York hospitals and about 1,300 new patients, Cuomo said. It raises the question: ""Of the people who are staying home, how rigorously are they staying at home?"" Stephen Morse, professor of epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, who focuses on risk assessment of infectious diseases, tells CNBC Make It. It's possible that as we enter the ninth and tenth week of fairly extreme prevention measures, people are feeling fatigued or getting too relaxed, says Joseph Vinetz, professor of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine and physician scientist in infectious diseases. ""Just because we're tired doesn't mean that the virus cares,"" he says. ""Viruses have no emotions; they just do their thing."" According to Cuomo, ""much of this comes down to what you do to protect yourself."" So from masks to groceries, here's a reminder checklist of the measures epidemiologists and infectious disease experts say you should still absolutely be following, even if you live in a place that's re-opening:

Use masks carefully

Since early April the Centers for Disease Control has suggested that people wear masks or cloth face coverings outside of the home to help prevent the spread of Covid-19. In addition to having a face mask to use, ""people have to be very careful about how they put them on and how they take some off,"" Morse says. Wash your hands before putting your mask on your face. Fit is key: Your mask should cover your nose and mouth snugly, but comfortably. ""There's a wire that goes over the nose piece that you have to mold to your nose,"" Vinetz says. ""Then you have to tuck [the mask] under your chin."" ""It's not hard [to wear a mask], but somebody has to kind of show people how to do it right,"" he adds. (This helpful video demonstrates how to wear a mask.) Indeed, wearing a mask can feel somewhat uncomfortable, but both for effective prevention and sanitary reasons, it's important to keep it on during your entire outing, instead of removing it to take breaks or talk to people. When you take your mask off, you should remove it without touching the front of it, and wash your hands afterwards, Morse says. ""If [masks] become contaminated and you touch them — even if your hands are clean — when you then touch your face afterwards you can infect yourself,"" he says. Reusable cloth masks should be cleaned regularly, per the CDC, which means after each time you wear it, or whenever it becomes soiled. You can wash masks in a washing machine with hot water, and tumble dry them with high heat.

Steer clear of people on the street

Most of us have heard that we need to be at least six feet from other people when out in public. ""That's not a magic number,"" but it's believed to be the distance necessary to prevent respiratory droplets from reaching you if someone sneezes or coughs, Morse says. Physical distance can be hard to come by. ""There's a limit to how far you can, especially in New York City, keep apart,"" Morse says. Try to avoid looking at people face-to-face when you're outside in crowded places, Morse says. ""It sounds strange,"" but it keeps you out of people's line of breath, he adds. You can also try to stagger how you're walking so that you're side-by-side with others, rather than directly behind someone.

Keep washing your hands diligently

Hand hygiene is still incredibly important, because it's easy to accidentally touch your face and infect yourself. ""You always want to make sure your hands are clean,"" Morse says. Wash your hands with soap and water or use hand sanitizer at all the normal times, he says. For example, wash your hands after going to the bathroom; after touching garbage; and before, during and after food prep. ""Also after you touch something on the outside and you come back inside,"" he says. That includes touching doorknobs, opening packages or pressing elevator buttons. Wearing gloves may give you a false sense of security, Vinetz says. If you do wear gloves, you should assume that your hands are dirty, and avoid touching your face. ""If anybody is wearing gloves, I look at them and say, 'You're contaminated, don't touch anything,'"" he says.

Be strategic about running errands

When you're running essential errands or frequenting businesses as they begin to open, you should still be extra careful. For starters, you definitely shouldn't be venturing out if you're sick, according to the CDC. Take fewer trips to the store to reduce the amount of exposure you have to other people, and order your food and medication for delivery if possible (and don't accept deliveries in-person), per the CDC. Opt to pay for your items online or over the phone, and use a contactless payment method if you can. If you do go to the store, stay at least six feet from other people and wear a cloth face covering or mask, the CDC says. Some stores have delineated a ""safe distance"" on the floor in checkout lines, and wipes available for patrons to disinfect shopping carts. But even still, you should not touch your eyes, nose or mouth throughout the duration of your trip. Once you're finished shopping, use hand sanitizer and wash your hands with soap and water when you're home.

Handle packages and groceries gingerly

Many people are relying on deliveries to get their groceries and other supplies with minimal contact. But there's evidence that the Covid-19 virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days. When you get a package or bring home a shopping bag, Morse suggests opening it outside of your home. ""Leave it outside the door, and then with clean hands, I would lift out the things that were inside,"" he says. If the contents look like they need to be cleaned, you can wipe them with a disinfectant, he says, but it's not totally necessary. Put the items on a surface that you can clean easily afterwards, and of course wash your hands, Morse says. ""There's only so much you can do, you know, within reason,"" he says.

Follow elevator etiquette

Riding the elevator with someone is a comparatively short time to be exposed to their germs, but you should still be mindful. ""Minimize the number of people in an elevator,"" Morse says. Elevators are slightly less crowded while people are staying home, so you should wait until you can catch a ride alone or with as few people as possible, he says. And wear a face mask while in the elevator, even if you're riding solo. Pressing buttons with a key or other inanimate object can't hurt, but you still need to wash your hands when you come home, he adds.

The weekly grocery run may never be the same

1:12 pm ET — The coronavirus pandemic is changing the way Americans go grocery shopping — perhaps forever, say experts. Whether it's sneeze-shields and contactless payment at cashier stations or more online shopping and increased purchases of locally sourced goods, how we stock our refrigerators, freezers and pantries looks a lot different than it did just a few months ago. Food shopping stands ready to change even more, as grocers turn to ever more contact-free automation to get jobs done. Robots are restocking shelves and patrolling store aisles, for example, while newfangled ""dark stores"" are open only for pick-up of online orders. Some of the changes may fade as the coronavirus does, but others will remain. CNBC's Melissa Repko talks to those in the know. — Kenneth Kiesnoski

Alexi Rosenfeld | Getty Images

Sanitation workers across the country are trying to adjust to unusually high waste levels in residential areas as the coronavirus pandemic shuts in much of the workforce at home. Waste in residential areas has spiked by as much as 40% in some parts of the country, according to one company's tally. To facilitate curbside pickup services, waste management companies are urging both their workers and clients to follow proper disposal protocols. To deal with the onslaught, some sanitation workers, who pick up and haul garbage and other waste, have begun to double or triple the number of trips they would make to residential neighborhoods under more normal circumstances. Often taken for granted, sanitation workers have become part of the frontline workforce keeping the country going even as the pandemic persists. And though they largely operate in the background of everyday life, they provide services that bolster comfortable living and cleanliness across the country. ""You can go your whole life without ever calling upon a firefighter or a police officer, but you can't go more than a couple days without having a sanitation worker in your life,"" said Belinda Mager, the director of communications at New York's sanitation department. ""They visit your block at least a couple days a week, and you may not even know it! But you'd know it if they were not there!"" Data collected in December from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that people who gather and dispose of waste and recyclable materials work the fifth most dangerous job in the United States. The coronavirus has heightened that risk factor. The pandemic adds to the inherent dangers of the job the risk of contracting the disease while handling waste with contaminated materials such as used tissues or face masks. This story is based on conversations with people linked to six waste removal groups in New York, California, Texas, Florida and Arizona, five states that represent some of the greatest risk zones for sanitation workers.

The risks

In an effort to minimize employees' risk of contracting the disease, several waste removal groups have been urging the public to dispose of their waste safely by ""putting all trash in closed bags, carts or containers,"" said David Biderman, executive director and CEO of Solid Waste Association of North America, or SWANA, a nonprofit that advocates for efficient solid waste management. ""We don't want sanitation collection workers touching discarded tissues or other material from a home in which someone has tested positive to coronavirus,"" Biderman said. Some companies, such as Florida-based Waste Pro USA, have issued guidance on how to handle waste. The company created a flyer that educates ""customers on how to properly dispose of their trash and recycling to protect themselves and our crews that is available to download on our website"" said Ron Pecora, senior vice president of Waste Pro USA, which operates in 11 states. Increased safety protocols have also extended to the companies themselves. Sanitation workers have received gloves, masks, and disinfecting products from their employers to maximize their own safety. And they're encouraged to practice social distancing while collecting trash. ""Traditionally everyone always wore gloves. But now everyone wears a thinner latex glove on the inside, in addition to a thick glove on the outside,"" said Josh Eisenstein, director of community outreach at Filco Carting, a Brooklyn, New York, waste management company.

Trucks are cleaned and disinfected frequently, said a spokesperson from Republic Services, an Arizona-based waste collection company operating in 41 states and Puerto Rico. ""All of our facilities and equipment are on an enhanced cleaning schedule, with cleanings scheduled multiple times per day,"" the spokesperson said. In Arizona, the new safety protocols have extended into processing centers, too, where employees are separated by ""plastic protective barriers to help keep them safe."" SWANA estimates that nearly 1,000 sanitation workers have tested positive for the coronavirus around the country, ""the majority of them in the New York City metropolitan area,"" Biderman said. But it's likely that these workers contracted the virus because of ""community spread, not contact with the trash,"" he added.

Spikes in residential waste

Waste among residential homes has increased as most Americans stay at home under shelter-in-place orders. ""Residential waste volume has increased between 5% to 35%, depending on the location, as Americans have been staying home and generating more trash and recyclables,"" Biderman said. At Waste Management, headquartered in Texas, residential waste went up by 25%, according to Janette Micelli, director of external affairs. To keep up with the unexpected volume of waste, several sanitation companies have suspended bulk pick-up services, meaning that sanitation workers temporarily avoid picking up large materials like tossed-out furniture. About 80 communities nationwide have reported temporary suspensions in curbside recycling or yard waste collection, according to estimates from SWANA. ""This was because these communities' sanitation departments have limited bandwidth and resources, and need to use their assets (trucks, people) to collect trash,"" Biderman explained. Some communities have begun to resume these services. In Southern California, sanitation workers have shut down some recycling facilities due to inability to keep adequate distance between workers, causing some curbside recyclables to end up in the landfill. Meanwhile, some companies have altered their schedules to keep up with the increased need for waste removal. Shelter-in-place guidelines have caused Americans to be ""thrown off their routine,"" said Pecora of Waste Pro USA, which has seen a 40% increase in residential waste in some areas. ""Rather than placing their materials out before going to work, they have been placing their materials out after our trucks have serviced their streets, resulting in a spike in calls concerning missed pickups,"" Pecora said. Additionally, Waste Pro USA workers have been reporting higher numbers of ""bulk items,"" including old televisions and mattresses, in Florida. It is an indication that many Americans are using the time at home to do some heavy-duty spring cleaning. ""This huge volume has resulted in significant increased expense as trucks are filling up and have to dispose, and then go back to same routes to complete,"" Pecora said.

Commercial waste falls

As residential waste rises, commercial waste is in a state of free fall, tumbling because of closures of nonessential businesses and stay-at-home guidelines. The biggest blow to commercial waste occurred ""in major cities,"" according to SWANA's Biderman. Filco Carting in Brooklyn has seen commercial waste drop by 50% since the pandemic hit. Commercial waste removal from places like restaurants and small businesses can only be handled by privately owned waste removal companies in New York. Once New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued orders of statewide shutdowns, business at New York waste removal companies began to drop off. ""Most private carters are operating with less trucks, as many customers are not operating, not producing waste and therefore less trucks are needed to collect the reduced waste,"" said Eisenstein of Filco. And businesses that have stayed open to offer essential services, like supermarkets, have reduced their waste, Eisenstein said, likely because fewer customers have been entering. Some of these businesses ""requested reduction in their frequency of pickups. Weeks ago when businesses were forced to close, many reached out to us to suspend service,"" he said.

Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., her husband Jeffrey Sprecher participate in Loefflers swear-in reenactment for the cameras in the Capitol on Monday, Jan. 6, 2020.

Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, refused to say Friday whether it has given federal law enforcement agencies information related to stock sales by CEO and Chairman Jeff Sprecher and his wife, Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler.

Intercontinental Exchange formally declined to comment after a flurry of news about a probe into stock sales in trading accounts related to four senators.

That news included Loeffler revealing that she has given documents and information to the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Senate Ethics Committee about the sales from accounts she had with Sprecher.

Those sales came in the weeks before financial markets plunged as the Covid-19 pandemic spread in the United States.

Intercontinental Exchange has not said in regulatory filings that either the company or Sprecher are the subject of criminal or civil probes or have turned over information to investigators about the CEO's trades.

The FBI and Department of Justice appears to be eyeing trades by Loeffler and Sprecher, as well as by Sens. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., and by the husband of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.

Accounts connected to those senators cumulatively sold millions of dollars worth of stock in the weeks before financial markets crashed in late February as Covid-19 cases in the United States began spiking.

Starting on Jan. 24, Loeffler and Sprecher sold stocks over the next three weeks that were valued at between $1.3 million and $3.1 million, according to disclosure reports filed by the senator.

All four senators say they did nothing wrong, and that the trades were not connected to non-public information they received.

That includes private briefings for lawmakers in January and early February by top federal health officials who warned senators about the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak before the United States began seeing large numbers of officially reported cases.

""We think we're going to have a vaccine in the pretty near future, and if we do we're going to really be a big step ahead,"" Trump told a reporter Friday at a White House event detailing U.S. efforts to develop a vaccine. ""And if we don't, we're going to be like so many other cases where you had a problem come in, it'll go away at some point, it'll go away,"" Trump said. ""It may flare up and it may not flare up, we'll have to see what happens, but if it does flare up we're going to put out the fire and we'll put it out quickly and efficiently. We've learned a lot."" The president had been asked about his comments earlier in the event, when he said, ""Vaccine or no vaccine, we're back. And we're starting the process. In many cases, they don't have vaccines and a virus or a flu comes and you fight through it."" Trump's remarks downplaying the need for a vaccine came during a Rose Garden announcement unveiling his administration's beefed-up efforts to fast-track the development and distribution of a vaccine for Covid-19. The new project, dubbed ""Operation Warp Speed,"" aims to have hundreds of millions of doses of an effective vaccine available by the end of the year.

Trump formally announced that former pharmaceutical executive Moncef Slaoui and four-star Army Gen. Gustave Perna will help lead the Warp Speed project. Slaoui and Perna both said at the event that they are ""confident"" the operation will be able to achieve its ambitious goals. But Perna acknowledged that it will be a ""Herculean task"" to develop and distribute a vaccine in such a short time frame. It's unclear whether the virus will disappear on its own. Global and U.S. health officials have suggested the virus may be seasonal and relent in the summer before emerging again in the colder seasons. SARS, which emerged in China in 2002 and killed nearly 800 people worldwide, was able to be contained without a vaccine. Health experts, including Trump administration officials, have warned that the virus would likely persist through the fall and could become even more difficult to combat in the winter when flu season picks up. Experts and political leaders alike say that the U.S. won't be able to recover from the pandemic until a vaccine is widely available. Some doubt a vaccine will be ready even within 18 months. Rick Bright, a federal vaccine expert who blew the whistle on the Trump administration after he was removed last month as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, said everything would have to go ""perfectly"" to achieve results in that time. ""We've never seen everything go perfectly,"" Bright said Thursday in testimony before members of a House health subcommittee. ""I still think 12 to 18 months is an aggressive schedule, and I think it's going to take longer than that to do so.""",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

House Democratic leaders plan to pass a $3 trillion coronavirus package Friday, even as Senate Republicans and the White House pledge to block what would be the largest emergency spending bill in U.S. history. The chamber aims to vote on the legislation by Friday night, along with a rules change to allow voting by proxy during the pandemic. Democrats are expected to pass the more than 1,800-page bill, despite growing unease in the party's right and left flanks. The sprawling proposal addresses Democrats' priorities to combat the economic and health crisis created by the outbreak: relief for cash-strapped state and local governments, another direct payment to Americans, hazard pay for essential workers and money to boost U.S. testing capacity. But it includes some more politically thorny elements, such as a provision to temporarily roll back the cap on state and local tax deductions — a move expected to help higher-income people most.

As Republicans question the need for more immediate fiscal relief, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi describes the bill as an opening proposal in the next phase of the congressional response, which already carries a price tag approaching $3 trillion across four bills. ""So now, we're putting our offer on the table. We're open to negotiation,"" the California Democrat told reporters on Thursday. The Senate has no plans to touch the bill. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Thursday called it ""an unserious product from an unserious majority."" The Trump administration also issued a veto threat. The efforts to approve more relief come as U.S. Covid-19 cases top 1.4 million, and American deaths from the disease surpass 85,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. As the U.S. unemployment rate spiked to 14.7% in April, states started to lift lockdown restrictions and business closures designed to slow the outbreak. In pushing for more federal relief money, Democrats have cited Wednesday comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who said ""additional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it if it helps avoid long-term economic damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery."" Despite President Donald Trump's opposition to the current legislation, he would be open to another coronavirus relief bill, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Thursday. Meanwhile, two administration officials told CNBC that the White House would likely support another round of stimulus checks to individuals. On Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told CNBC he is ""optimistic"" Congress can reach a deal on another coronavirus response plan and called for talks with Republicans. Later in the day, McConnell outlined two priorities he wants to see in a bill: provisions to increase testing capacity and legal protections for doctors and businesses as the economy starts to reopen. He called a liability shield — which Democrats have generally criticized — a ""red line"" in future legislation.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) speaks during a campaign rally at the Altria Theatre on February 29, 2020 in Richmond, Virginia.

A group of Senate Democrats introduced legislation Friday to provide grants to nonprofits to bolster hiring efforts as their resources dwindle amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

The bill, introduced by Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, is meant to equip nonprofits with a strong workforce that can continue to provide essential services to vulnerable Americans.

Nonprofits will be able to apply directly for the grants through the Treasury Department, according to a press release from Klobuchar's office announcing the bill, which is called WORK NOW, or the Work Opportunities and Resources to Keep Nonprofit Organizations Well Act. The hope is the grants will allow nonprofits to retain their workforce or provide jobs for newly unemployed people.

Since government lockdowns began, nonprofits and institutions catering to vulnerable populations like domestic violence shelters, homeless shelters and food banks, have seen steep declines in volunteers and revenue. At the same time, these nonprofits are trying to adhere to social distancing guidelines as they grapple with ways to stay afloat.

In some cases, volunteer shortages have led to higher expenses to maintain the same levels of service.

About 72.5% of nonprofits surveyed said they've seen reduced contributions since the pandemic hit, according to a report released Thursday. The survey, conducted by the Charities Aid Foundation of America, asked about 880 nonprofits around the world to weigh in on how the coronavirus has affected them.

""Nonprofits are on the front lines of this crisis helping millions of Americans in need. From food banks, to shelters, to counseling centers, charitable organizations are doing incredible work to help families put food on their table, provide housing assistance, and serve people with disabilities,"" Klobuchar said in the release.

""But as demand for their services soars, many of these organizations are struggling financially. At the same time, over 36 million men and women have lost their jobs and are looking for work. We need to help charitable nonprofits keep their doors open, scale their invaluable services, and provide opportunities for unemployed men and women to return to work serving their communities.""

The WORK NOW Act is sponsored by Sens. Tom Carper and Chris Coons of Delaware, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.

The outbreak has spread to dozens of countries globally, with more than 4.4 million confirmed cases worldwide and over 302,493 deaths so far, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. There are at least 1.4 million cases in the United States and at least 85,906 deaths, according to the latest tallies.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

You may qualify for paid leave

Justin Paget

Qualified workers, including those telecommuting, can get two weeks of paid leave at full pay courtesy of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. Valid reasons include being unable to work because you are under quarantine order, have coronavirus symptoms and are seeking diagnosis, or must care for a child whose school or daycare provider is shut. If you're caring for a sick family member, you might still qualify for a portion of your pay.

Help with utility bills

Andrew Aitchison

Many utility companies — including PG&E, Con Edison, American Electric Power Company and Duke Energy, among others — have suspended service disconnections. You may be able to set up a payment plan for your utility bill or have some fees waived, such as for late payments. Check the website of your provider for assistance tapping into other support programs, such as Housing and Urban Development's Covid-19 resources. Your state's website may help. Some are stopping utility companies from shutting off services.

Sign up for insurance

If you lost your job and need health insurance, some states are holding special ACA open enrollments. AARP keeps an updated list of extensions on state health exchanges.

Uninsured people in Washington, D.C., Maryland, New York and Vermont can enroll for health insurance through their state exchanges through June 15. California is allowing state residents to enroll through June 30. Find out if you qualify for Medicaid by inputting your state, family size and income level on the Healthcare.gov calculator.

Rent relief

The CARES Act has aid for homeowners who are struggling with their federally backed mortgage payments but renters also have some help. Many states and cities have put a stop order on evictions. New York, for instance, has a 90-day eviction ban. A Columbia Law School professor frequently updates this list of state actions.

There's no doubt the coronavirus pandemic has hit small businesses hard. For some, like retail and wholesale bakery Ovenly, it meant completely shutting down their operations. The New York-based business had to lay off its entire staff of 66 employees, said Agatha Kulaga, the co-founder and CEO. ""It was … just survival mode,"" she said. ""It was really about, 'What are we going to do? What are the decisions to make right now to save our business so we can reopen successfully when this crisis is over?"" Kulaga was part of a live roundtable discussion streamed on both CNBC's and Glamour's Facebook pages on Friday, hosted by Glamour Magazine editor-in-chief Samantha Barry. CNBC reporter Kate Rogers joined in, as well as Shyla Sheppard, founder and CEO of Bow & Arrow Brewing Co, and Erin Patinkin, co-founder and CEO of Seemore Meats & Veggies.

Almost a third of small-business owners have had to close their in-person business operations because of government regulations put in place as a response to the pandemic, according to the latest CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey. In addition, 23% have temporarily closed their entire business. That's led to cuts: Thirty-six percent have reduced their own pay, 8% have cut their employees' pay, 13% have furloughed some or all of their employees and 11% have laid off some or all of their employees, the survey found. ""In these times, it's really important to just dig deep, have grit and determination,"" said Sheppard, whose brewery and beer hall is located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. ""It's really critical right now to pivot in this environment.""

""Since the to-go-only restrictions went into place, we've been scrambling to package product in glass growlers, growlers cans that are filled on demand,"" she said.

The loss of funding

For Erin Patinkin, the coronavirus' impact on the stock market in March led to the loss of $1.25 million in Series A funding she was expecting to get for Seemore Meats & Veggies, which only officially launched in February. While her first thought was empathy for the funding company, which lost money in the market, she was also concerned about the future of her business. ""I was really anxiety-ridden and really stressed but my only thought was, 'I have to make a strategy to move forward,'"" Patinkin said. That meant she had to let go of some of the ""ego"" she thought she would have around the company's valuation and get the proper amount of money, even if it was fewer dollars, to fund the business. ""For a seven-day period, I didn't even think about emotions,"" she said. ""I was just driving forward in order to ensure we had a runway for at least a year because I am concerned about fundraising even three to six months from now.""

Navigating PPP

All three women applied for and received The federal Paycheck Protection Program loans. However, they are still unsure about the right way to use the money and are hopeful there may be adjustments in the requirements. The federal PPP, which offers forgivable loans to cover payroll for eight weeks after the loan is signed, was supposed to help. In order to get the forgiveness, at least 75% of the money must go to payroll. The rest is to be used for other business-related purposes. The first round of $349 billion in funding ran out in a matter of days. However, an additional $310 billion was approved, and, as of Thursday night, there was still about $100 billion left in unallocated capital. ""There's a lot of pressure to use [the money] on payroll versus sustaining your business through several months of uncertainty,"" said Ovenly's Kulaga. More from Invest in You:

Most eligible Americans have by now received their check, called economic impact payments, though some are still being mailed to those who did not provide direct deposit information to the IRS. The checks have provided something of a cushion to the tens of millions of people who are out of work or have had their hours reduced, though many critics and lawmakers said they did not go far enough. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said a second round of direct payments is ""necessary"" for the survival of many Americans, and that they would help stimulate the economy. But those checks are not likely to hit bank accounts soon, if at all. Here's what you need to know.

Where does the legislation stand?

House Democrats introduced the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, or HEROES Act, a new piece of coronavirus legislation, that, among other relief measures, includes a second round of stimulus payments of up to $1,200 per person. The bill was passed in the House on Friday, but it is unlikely to make it through the Republican-controlled Senate, at least in its current form, NBC News reports. ""What Nancy Pelosi is proposing will never pass the Senate,"" Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said Tuesday.

How much would the checks be worth?

Under the legislation, individuals would receive another payment of up to $1,200 (or $2,400 for married couples), and $1,200 per dependent (up to three). The income eligibility thresholds would be the same as the first round of checks: Individuals earning up to $75,000 and couples earning up to $150,000 would receive $1,200. After that, the checks would completely phase out at $99,000 for individuals and $198,000 for couples.

What about dependents?

Unlike the first round of checks, all dependents would be eligible for the additional credit, not just those under 17. And that credit is worth much more: $1,200, compared to $500 for the first round. Each household could receive a maximum of three dependent credits. The first round of stimulus checks excluded adult dependents, including many in college.

What else is different?

This legislation also does not require recipients have a Social Security number to be eligible, which means those who file taxes with a taxpayer identification number (TIN) could receive a check this time around. Those without an SSN were excluded from the first round of checks.

""When all this is over — and as we've said, it will end — we will get over coronavirus, but there will still be health disparities, which we really do need to address in the African American community,"" he said in an April 7 press briefing. Those ""disparities"" Fauci mentioned are linked to early numbers that show African Americans are disproportionately dying from Covid-19. In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the state's population, but account for 41% of coronavirus deaths, according to data released by Michigan's government. In Illinois, black people make up 14% of the population, but account for 32.5% of coronavirus deaths, according to the state's Department of Public Health. In Louisiana, where black people make up about 33% of the population, Gov. John Bel Edwards said in early April they account for more than 70% of the state's coronavirus deaths, with the majority of these fatalities taking place in New Orleans. And in New York City, black and Latino people are twice as likely to die from the virus than their white peers, according to data by the local government. All of these figures are based on the most recent data released to the public, with more states and local governments being pressured to share a racial breakdown of their numbers.

""There are definitely multiple reasons why we're seeing black communities be disproportionately impacted by Covid-19,"" New York-based physician Dr. Uche Blackstock tells CNBC Make It. She explains that when you look at the ""social determinants of health,"" such as where a person lives, works and the quality of health care they have access to, you will see that structural racism has left African Americans ""vulnerable and marginalized."" ""Even before this [pandemic], we had significant health inequities,"" she adds, while emphasizing the increased levels of diabetes, high blood pressure, hypertension, asthma and obesity in the black community. ""And what we're finding out is that these are the underlying medical conditions that result in very serious complications from Covid-19."" CNBC Make It spoke with Blackstock, along with five other black doctors, nurses and experts, to get their thoughts on how housing location, health-care access and distrust in the medical system have all contributed to the racial health disparities we see today.

Housing location and resources

Due to a history of housing discrimination and redlining, which is the systemic practice of refusing government resources to predominantly black neighborhoods because they've been deemed a financial risk, generations of African Americans have been forced to live in areas that lack access to healthy food options. Many of these neighborhoods, which researchers have categorized as ""food deserts"" are filled with fast food restaurants and small corner stores that have more junk food options than fresh fruits and vegetables. ""I think it's really important to understand that dietary choices aren't moral choices,"" says Chinara Tate, director of nutrition at Mount Sinai Eating and Weight Disorders Center of Excellence in New York. She explains that for many black and brown people living in poor communities, the food choices they make are made through a survival mindset, and they don't have the luxury of thinking about the long-term impact of their diet. ""If you have the option of purchasing an onion for a dollar or purchasing a meal for a dollar, it makes the most sense to purchase the meal, even if it's not the healthiest option because an onion is not going to feed your family."" As a result, residents in these communities tend to rely on high calorie foods that are cheaper and more accessible, says Dr. Jessie Marshall, an assistant professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School. ""And we know that results in chronic diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity,"" she says. ""So again, Covid-19 did not create these racial disparities that we are seeing. It simply magnified these disparities in unbelievable ways.""

Employment and health-care options

In 2017, 55.5% of African Americans had private health insurance, compared to 75.4% of white Americans, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. That same year, 43.9% of African Americans relied on Medicaid or public health insurance and 9.9% were uninsured altogether. This disparity in health care is linked to the employment of African Americans who, along with Latinos and Hispanics, are overly represented in low-income roles that often lack insurance and benefits for hourly workers. Today, 63% of Latino or Hispanic workers and 54% of black workers earn low wages, compared to 40% of Asian American workers and 37% of white workers, according to a 2019 report by the Brookings Institution, which found that even in these low-wage roles, black and Hispanic workers earn less than white workers with the same education level and experience. Low wages, according to the study, are categorized as jobs that pay a median salary of $10.22 per hour or $17,950 per year. Some of these roles include grocery store clerks, home health aides, fast food workers and other service sector jobs that have been deemed ""essential"" during the coronavirus pandemic. Not only do these roles require workers to work outside the home, but many of them also offer no paid sick or family leave. ""Anyone who knows the history of America is not surprised,"" says Belinda Archibong, assistant professor of economics at Columbia University's Barnard College. Despite the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibiting employment discrimination, she says black Americans still face racial and gender barriers that keep them locked out of top jobs. In situations where black workers have been forced to hold positions with little to no benefits, she says she's watched first-hand how they have ignored long-standing health issues because of the cost. ""I've seen my own family go through the fact that when you don't have health insurance you basically avoid the doctor until it's like a life-or-death scenario,"" says Archibong. For many essential black and brown workers, she says it may be common for them to not even know they have underlying health conditions because they don't have insurance to visit a doctor regularly. Therefore, if they get Covid-19, and it's paired with untreated health conditions, their odds of beating the virus could be low.

For many people, starting a company in the midst of a global economic crisis is the last thing on their lockdown to-do list. But it might not be such a crazy idea. According to entrepreneurs and start-up investors CNBC spoke with, now might even be the best time to start thinking about setting up a new venture from home. The coronavirus pandemic is in many ways serving as a ""catalyst to creation,"" Index Ventures Partner Jan Hammer told CNBC. He thinks history may be on the side of entrepreneurs building their businesses at a time of adversity. ""If history gives us a good precedent, out of the last crisis — which was the great financial crisis of 2008 to 2010 — a cohort of extremely resilient businesses have emerged,"" Hammer said in an interview. He cited examples such as food delivery firm Just Eat, payments company Adyen and money transfer start-up TransferWise, which were all founded in 2001, 2006 and 2011 respectively. ""These were ideas born in, you could argue, difficult times,"" Hammer added. ""And in a way, the trends that had driven the growth of these businesses were unrelated to the macroeconomic cycle.""

There are plenty of businesses which were founded during or around the time of economic crises. General Motors, IBM and HP are some of the biggest names that were born out of downturns, such as the panic of 1907 and the Great Depression. Meanwhile, many tech start-ups, such as Groupon, Uber and Pinterest, were established during or shortly after the Great Recession.

Building new ventures

Lara Vandenberg launched Publicist, an online marketplace for businesses to find freelancers in PR and communications, on Tuesday. Usually New York-based, Vandenberg temporarily moved back to her native Australia as the coronavirus hit the U.S., but pressed on regardless of the time difference. Around 35% of the U.S. workforce — or 57 million people — are freelance, according to a report by jobs website Upwork, and the pandemic has accelerated a move to project-based work, Vandenberg said. Publicist is about to close a funding round after bootstrapping the beta site, though isn't disclosing how much it has raised. It will charge hirers 20% commission per project. ""Although we are launching a company at this really volatile point in this macro economy, the future of work is an area people are really excited about,"" Vandenberg told CNBC. ""And in parallel, it's just an exciting problem to solve.""

For Chris Howard, co-founder at venture fund Fuel Capital, now is a good time to promote a new company because ad space is cheaper. ""You have an increase in the amount of time that users are spending online,"" he told CNBC. ""You can get a better understanding of cost per new customer that you're adding … then you can begin retention marketing campaigns.""

"" I can totally identify with the mindset where you say now is not the time to quit a job."" ""It's also a time where a lot of things look pretty trivial,"" he added.

The trade association for the world's airlines said that demand for air travel had dropped more than 90% in Europe and the U.S. since the start of the pandemic, and warned that recovery will be even slower if lockdowns and travel restrictions are extended. ""We are asking governments to have a phased approach to restart the industry and to fly again,"" Alexandre de Juniac, the IATA's director general and CEO, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday. De Juniac is hopeful that some flying will resume by the summer. ""We are aiming at reopening and boosting the domestic market by end of the second quarter, and opening the regional or continental markets — such as Europe, North America or Asia-Pacific — by the third quarter, and intercontinental in the fall,"" he said. ""So for summer we hope that you will see flights within Europe coming back, with I hope interesting prices and very safe processes of control."" The European Union's external borders remain closed to non-EU nationals until mid-June. The European Commission has recommended a phased approach for its member states to reopen borders that would start with countries with low levels of coronavirus infections.

The comments from the IATA com as travel groups are desperate to bring operations back to life and some are already rolling out plans to do so. United Airlines has expressed its aims to schedule Europe and China routes in June, Dubai's flagship Emirates Airline will recommence nine outbound routes starting May 21 and European low-cost carrier Ryanair expects to have 40% of its flights running by July 1. Budget carrier Wizz Air will restart routes from London's Luton Airport starting June 16, Lufthansa is planning service expansion in June and IAG will resume some flights in July, among others.

Mandatory quarantine 'useless'

But any hopes for a boost to the industry with some resumed travel will be dashed if governments institute mandatory 14-day quarantine periods for travelers upon arrival, de Juniac warned. ""We are advocating with governments not to implement quarantine measures that will retain people for two weeks that will arrive anywhere,"" he said. ""We think that it is useless provided we have implemented the health and sanitary controls that we are discussing with governments. It is absolutely key for the tourist industry which is so important for so many countries in Europe."" Scores of countries including Australia, New Zealand, China, Spain and potentially the U.K. are requiring international travelers to quarantine for two weeks upon arrival, with varying degrees of enforcement: in Australia, arrivals are escorted to a hotel where they must remain for 14 days, while in other countries they are expected to ""self-quarantine"" at home. Hong Kong issued state-monitored tracking bracelets that arrivals must wear to ensure they do not leave their area of quarantine. Such policies will no doubt deter many people from wanting to travel. De Juniac believes quarantine periods are simply not necessary as long as airlines and airports uphold stringent sanitation and monitoring practices. ""Is it possible to have an aircraft full and without risk of contamination? Our answer is yes,"" de Juniac said, ""provided we implement control and sanitary processes for passengers just before the flight — by asking for temperature control, by the obligation to wear a mask, by cleaning the aircraft properly and disinfecting properly, by limiting the distribution of food to prepackaged food, by limiting cabin luggage to one luggage to avoid disembarking and embarking process to be too overcrowded."" With such a multilayered approach, he argued, ""you limit the risk of contamination. ... And then the quarantine is not useful from our point of view in this case.""

The chamber also approved voting by proxy and remote committee work. The rules changes, major moves for a tradition-bound institution, aim to make it easier for representatives to conduct business from outside of Washington during the crisis.

The House passed the rescue legislation in a close 208-199 vote, as Democrats saw defections from both the left and right flanks of the party. Fourteen Democrats voted against the bill and one Republican supported it.

The bill includes:

Nearly $1 trillion for cash-strapped state and local governments

A second round of $1,200 direct payments to individuals, with up to $6,000 per household

$200 billion for hazard pay for essential workers

$75 billion for Covid-19 testing efforts

An extension of the $600 per week federal unemployment insurance benefit through January (it is currently set to go through July)

$175 billion in rent, mortgage and utility assistance

A 15% increase in the maximum Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefit

Repeal of the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions for two years, which would help certain states' budget crunch but benefit higher-income taxpayers most

Expanded mail-in ballot access, which Republicans oppose

Relief funds for the U.S. Postal Service

$10 billion in emergency small business disaster assistance grants

Subsidies and a special Affordable Care Act enrollment period for people who lose employer-sponsored health coverage

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made it clear he has no interest in taking up the proposal. On Thursday, he said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ""published an 1,800-page seasonal catalog of left-wing oddities and called it a coronavirus relief bill."" The White House threatened to veto the legislation before the House voted.

Pelosi, a California Democrat, has characterized her party's bill as an opening offer in what she hopes will become negotiations with Republicans on another round of fiscal relief. On Friday, she criticized Republicans who said they want to wait to pass more aid.

""Do you think this virus is taking a pause?"" she asked. ""Do you think that the rent takes a pause? Do you think that putting food on the table or the hunger that comes if you can't takes a pause?""

While the president opposed the Democratic plan, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany indicated this week that he would back another relief bill.

Two administration officials told CNBC that the White House would likely support another round of direct payments — a popular piece of the unprecedented emergency spending law passed in March.

McConnell has called for liability protections for doctors and businesses as part of any future legislation the Senate passes. Democrats have generally criticized such a provision.

After Democrats passed the bill Friday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer's office told members not to expect votes next week. The House is set to be in session on May 27 and 28.

The pandemic continues to ravage the country. The U.S. now has more than 1.4 million cases, and the disease has killed more than 86,000 Americans, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

More than 36 million people have filed jobless claims since the crisis started.

BEIJING — The unemployment rate in China remained near historic highs in April, highlighting the challenges the world's second-largest economy still faces in recovering fully from the economic shock of the coronavirus. China's official, but highly doubted, urban unemployment rate rose to 6.0% in April, from 5.9% in March, according to figures released Friday by the National Bureau of Statistics. ""The pressure on employment is rather large,"" bureau spokeswoman Liu Aihua told reporters at least three times during Friday's press conference. That's according to a CNBC translation of her Mandarin-language remarks.

Although monthly figures for the overall economy show some recovery, challenges remain, such as resuming work and the impact of the virus overseas, Liu said. ""Right now, the trajectory of economic development still requires observation, but ... based on the results of policies for resuming work and production, we have the confidence, ability and basis for extending the momentum of recovery and improvement."" Liu noted that the bureau's survey found that at the end of April, the number of migrant workers who had returned to their jobs in the cities was about 90% of what it was a year ago. In early March, official figures showed the return to work for migrant workers from the poorest households in the country was about half of what it was a year ago. More than half of China extended the Lunar New Year holiday by at least a week in an effort to control the Covid-19 disease, which first emerged late last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan. By early March, the virus outbreak had stalled domestically while accelerating its spread overseas. Covid-19 has now killed more than 302,000 people worldwide, including over 4,600 in China.

Slowing economy to hit more jobs

Similar lockdowns on economic activity in the U.S. sent the unemployment rate soaring to 14.7% in April, the highest since World War II and up from months of historic lows near 4% or less. In February, the peak of the coronavirus outbreak in China, the unemployment rate jumped to a record high of 6.2%. For the 25 to 59-year-old group, the rate has hovered near 5.5% for the last three months. The average work-hours a week per employee also fell in April by 30 minutes to 44.3 hours, the data showed. China's unemployment data have been highly doubted, even after the country changed its methodology from worker claims to a survey in 2018 in an effort to capture more of the job losses. The urban unemployment rate has hovered near 4% to 5% for the last 20 years. ""We think that pressure on employment will continue,"" Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance, said Friday. He pointed to factors such as fewer new jobs due to slower economic growth, sluggish demand for Chinese exports and a record-high number of university graduates this year. The continued struggles of small and medium-sized enterprises, which contribute to the majority of jobs and growth in China, adds further pressure to employment. Pang pointed to third-party business registration data that showed 460,000 companies closed in the first quarter, while the establishment of 3.2 million new Chinese companies during that time still marked a nearly 29% decrease from a year ago.

Last week, the American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) introduced its Safe Stay guidelines developed under the guidance of an advisory council that includes Accor, InterContinental Hotels Group, Marriot International, Omni Hotels & Resorts and Walt Disney. Now, the health and cleaning guidelines are being adopted by thousands of hotels, with many choosing to go beyond its recommendations.

Getting to your hotel

Arriving by air? There's a chance your hotel has started cleaning the area around you before you're even left the airport. Sandals Resorts identified 18 key touch points — or points of high contact — for extra cleaning, starting with airport lounges and vehicle transfers. Many hotels are increasing the frequency of airport transfers to reduce the number of passengers in each vehicle too.

If you're arriving via your own car, don't assume a valet team will be waiting out front, as many hotels like the Hotel Crescent Court in Dallas, Texas are suspending the service. Other hotels are keeping it and disinfecting the vehicle between drivers. Bell hops — where are the bell hops? Be prepared to carry your own bags. Camelback Resort in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains has suspended its bell service, though guests can use bell carts which have been sanitized after every use. Its hotel employees aren't opening car or taxi doors upon arrival either.

Stepping into the lobby

Don't be alarmed if you're stopped at the hotel's front door for a wellness screening and temperature check. This is what Camelback is doing. The resort — which is scheduled to reopen on June 11 — is also asking guests to use hand sanitizer, wear a mask and comply with six-foot social distancing policies. Next, you reach for the front door, and — there's no handle? It's been removed to eliminate a major touch point. How about a welcome drink? No dice. Instead, you'll be provided with branded PPE (personal protective equipment) upon arrival. Inside the lobby, you will likely find your favorite hotel looks different. Aesthetics are taking a backseat to safety with social distancing signage displayed throughout hotels, hand sanitizing stations placed every 50 to 100 feet and furniture removed to discourage congregating. Floors may be marked to encourage one-way pedestrian flow between entrances and exits.

Checking into your room

To check in, there is a good chance you'll avoid the front desk entirely. Hotels, such as the The Wayfinder Hotel in Newport, Rhode Island, are offering curbside check-in while major hotel chains are transitioning to ""digital keys"" which allow you to check in and out (and pay your bill) via your mobile phone. This eliminates the need for magnetic key cards (which must be sanitized after every use), queuing with other guests and interacting with the front desk staff. Hilton has introduced contactless check-in and check-outs at more than 4,700 hotels around the globe, including its Waldorf Astoria and Conrad Hotels & Resorts. The new technology will require enhanced communication with guests, many of whom are accustomed to heading straight to the front desk, which is exactly what hotels want to avoid.

Mobile phone check-ins mean guests will spend less time in communal areas, like those of the Waldorf Astoria Jerusalem (shown here). © 2020 Hilton

Front desk staff will still be present — likely standing behind a plexiglass partition — and sporting new accoutrements to their impeccably polished attire: masks and gloves. Chip and pin readers will be used to avoid the need to pass credit cards for payment, an act the AHLA recommends should result in an employee washing their hands ""for at least 20 seconds."" The front desk, even if not used much, will be cleaned at multiple points throughout the day, as will elevator buttons, public bathrooms, vending machines, ATMs, handrails and seating areas.

Walking through the hotel

Staff may no longer escort you to — or show you around — your room, and elevators are being limited to just the people in your party. The latter may not be as hard as it sounds, as more hotels are instituting maximum guest occupancy rates, such as the Relais & Chateaux hotel Eden Roc Cap Cana in the Dominican Republic which will operate at a maximum of 30% capacity, while European luxury hotel brand Rocco Forte Hotels is limiting the number of guests per floor.

On the way to the room, you'll likely pass more cleaning staff than in the past — for good reason. ""Hotels will have more visual cleaning staff and sanitizing stations. Housekeepers will move from behind the scene to front and center in hotels,"" said Tony Kim, assistant professor at Hart School of Hospitality, Sport and Recreation management at James Madison University, noting the mere presence of cleaning staff will make guests feel safer.

Inside your hotel room

Changes to your room may be apparent before you even enter. Hilton is applying a seal on guestroom doors to indicate they haven't been accessed since they were last cleaned. The room itself may look strangely bare. Why? Items that are difficult to disinfect are missing, including decorative pillows, bed scarves, notepads, pamphlets and pens. Minibars — they're gone too, though they may be replaced in another way, such as the pop-up bodegas being installed at the front desk of Kimpton luxury boutique hotels. Other items, such as robes, will be available upon request. On the upside, a welcome drink and cool hand towel may be waiting for you in your room, as Sandals Resorts are doing. Many hotels are giving guests in-room personal safety kits stocked with masks, disinfectant and wipes.

Guests at luxury, all-inclusive AMResorts in the Caribbean and Central and South America will find pillows, blankets and in-room tablets sealed in vacuum packaging. Remington Hotels — a Dallas-based hospitality group that manages select Sheraton, Westin and Marriott hotels among others — is testing Germ Guard, a single-use preventative sleeve that slides over remote control devices. Daily newspaper deliveries are going digital with electronic PressReader access that customers can read on their personal devices. Similarly, face-to-face concierge services are moving to text messaging through software such as Kipsu and Whistle. None of this — not one part — will come easy for hotels. ""Hotels have always focused on personalized service and providing a warm, welcoming environment for its guests,"" said Kate Walsh, the dean of the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University. ""The challenge for hotels will be to convey the essence of hospitality when we socially distance and disconnect guests from the staff.""

Housekeeping matters

Perhaps one of the biggest changes will be to housekeeping services. Room cleanings will be more intense but conducted less often, at least for guests staying multiple nights. Unless specifically requested, most cleanings will be done after guests leave. Some hotels, such as Best Western, are waiting 24 to 72 hours to enter a room after guests have left. Room cleanings are now concentrating on high-touch points, such as door and furniture handles, faucets, light switches, remote controls, thermostats, clocks and hangers. Used towels may be placed outside the door for pickup and replaced with a sealed bag of fresh ones, again found outside the door. Major brands such as Hilton and Marriott are turning to electrostatic sprayers and ultraviolet light technology. Sandals Resorts are sanitizing air ducts upon each departure and steam-cleaning room carpets every week.

The Westin Houston Medical Center was the first hotel to deploy robots to disinfect guest rooms and communal areas. Made by San Antonio-based Xenex Disinfection Services, the germ-zapping robots are designed to kill bacteria, fungi and viruses using UV light. They have been shown to destroy coronavirus, the company says.

Restaurants and room service

Amani Roberts, co-director of Cal State Fullerton's Center for Entertainment and Hospitality Management, believes hotel food and beverage outlets and banquet facilities will be affected more than any other area. ""I personally think buffets will no longer be in existence, which will increase food costs for hotels,"" he said. The AHLA recommends limiting buffets, but if offered, serving them via a masked attendant. Remington Hotels are moving away from buffets to open seating arrangements in outdoor areas. ""Many restaurants in a hotel will either remain closed or limit the capacity. If remaining closed, hotels will offer room delivery service — some via a robot-delivery system — or quick grab-and-go service,"" said Kim. ""If hotels decided to open, they will limit the capacity by removing some tables and chairs and installing partitions for communal tables.""

Hotel restaurants are moving to paper and digital menus, the latter located on walls or via customer's mobile phone, with a renewed reliance on single-use plastic and paper products. Bar stools are being removed to provide space between customers. Payment will happen table-side at sanitized mobile credit card terminals, like that at the InterContinental Los Angeles Downtown. Other hotels are getting creative. Room service menus are being expanded, delivery is moving to ""knock and drop"" at guest doors and ordering is done via customers' mobile phones, such as that offered at over 3,200 Marriott hotels. The Palms Turks & Caicos is introducing family-style in-room dining menus, and the historic Washington School House Hotel in Park City, Utah, has started a new ""Anyplace Dining"" option where guests can eat in quiet parts of the hotel, by the pool and in the private garden.

Communal spaces and entertainment

Many sports and recreational areas are closed or operating at limited capacities with enhanced cleanings. Some hotels are limiting pools to half the normal number of people allowed. ""Similar to guests making a massage appointment, hotels may now require advance-timed reservations for using the tennis court, pool, spa and other amenities,"" said Rob Karp, CEO of luxury travel agency MilesAhead.

It's cleaning the gym before and after each guest and introducing in-room fitness options. Other hotels are allowing guests to use bikes, beach chairs and umbrellas but are cleaning them after every use.

The country's government confirmed in a statement on Friday that its Covid-19 epidemic had ended, after Slovenia's National Institute of Public Health concluded ""all indicators point to a slowdown in the spread of the virus in the population.""

According to data from Slovenia's Ministry of Health, just one new case of the coronavirus was confirmed on Thursday, with no deaths reported. Over the past two weeks, just 35 people had been infected with the coronavirus, according to the health authority, while the reproductive number for the virus — known as the R rating or R0 — was below 1.

An R below 1 means each infected individual will on average transmit the virus to less than one other person.

On Thursday, Prime Minister Janez Jansa told parliament that the Balkan country ""has the best epidemiological picture in Europe.""

World health officials are increasingly hearing about cases of an inflammatory disease similar to Kawasaki disease in a few countries, including the United States and Italy, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, head of WHO's emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, said during a news conference at the agency's headquarters in Geneva.

Doctors and world leaders need ""to be on the alert"" for cases of a rare inflammatory disease in children that may be linked to the coronavirus, the World Health Organization said Friday.

""We need more information collected in a systematic way because with the initial reports, we're getting a description of what this looks like, which is not always the same,"" Kerkhove said. ""And in some children, they tested positive for Covid-19 and other children have not. So we do not know if this is associated with Covid-19.""

Kerkhove said officials raised the alert among the WHO's global clinical network, which is a group of clinicians across the world dealing with Covid-19 patients.

Working with the network, the WHO has developed a preliminary case definition and a case report form for PMIS, according to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

""I call on all clinicians worldwide to work with your national authorities and WHO to be on the alert and better understand this syndrome in children,"" Tedros said.

Early in the outbreak, researchers and infectious disease experts said the virus appeared to be sparing children while hitting the elderly and those with underlying health conditions particularly hard.

Since then, researchers have learned much more about the virus, including that children do get it and can die from it, even without underlying conditions that tend to worsen symptoms. Most kids report mild respiratory symptoms, namely fever, dry cough and fatigue. However, some children can become seriously ill.

In New York, local health officials are investigating 110 cases of the disease they are calling pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome. So far, 16 other states across the U.S. and six European countries are also investigating the disease.

World Health Organization officials said last month that they were investigating whether the coronavirus causes Kawasaki disease in children after several cases cropped up in Europe.

As health officials struggle to find more information about the mysterious illness, Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's emergencies program, urged the need to understand the extent of the inflammatory syndrome's association with Covid-19.

""This is a new disease,"" Ryan said. ""When new diseases cross the species' barrier, they very often don't have what you call a primary target organ.""

There have been reports of respiratory syndromes, cardiovascular syndromes and neurological syndromes as a result of a Covid-19 infection because the virus can attack different types of organs, according to Ryan.

He said researchers don't know whether these syndromes, including PMIS, are directly associated with the coronavirus and their attack on human cells or if they're a result of the body's immune response to the virus.

""In many emerging diseases we see both happen,"" Ryan said. ""The virus itself can cause damage and sometimes the immune response to the virus itself can cause damage.""

There's still a lot to learn and uncover on ""what's causing what,"" in order to develop countermeasures and therapies to reduce the impact of this disease in children, he added.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

The U.K. will most likely fail to strike a new trade agreement with the European Union by the end of the year, analysts said, as the coronavirus crisis threatens to derail official trade talks.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to conclude a post-Brexit trade deal this year. The U.K., which left the bloc on Jan. 31, is in a transition phase until December. During the transition, it is working to establish trade arrangements with the 27-nation EU.

However, this timeline is now at risk after the two lead negotiators had to isolate due to Covid-19 infections.

""The pandemic has completely taken over the agenda in both the EU and in London, and relegated the Brexit talks to a secondary issue,"" Constantine Fraser, European political analyst at research firm TS Lombard, told CNBC on Thursday.

""It was always going to be difficult to reach an agreement in the limited time available this year. The pandemic means it will now be impossible.""

British and European negotiating teams held a call on Wednesday for the first time since both lead negotiators were forced to self-isolate.

The EU's negotiator, Michel Barnier, tested positive for the virus in March but he has now recovered. The U.K.'s Johnson announced he had also tested positive for the virus last month. He was discharged from hospital on April 12 after three nights in intensive care, and continues to recover.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

The U.K. finally left the European Union on Jan. 31, but it remains in a transition period and has a deadline of end 2020 to set a free-trade deal with the EU. Now, whether Britain would be able to meet that deadline is in question.

""In all circumstances it's very difficult to imagine how some sort of large scale trade deal between the U.K. and the EU gets done by the end of the year,"" Amanda Sloat, a senior fellow at Brookings Institution, told CNBC on Tuesday.

""In the last couple weeks, we've seen EU's Brexit negotiator get coronavirus, the British negotiator has also been showing symptoms and now of course this very sad situation with the prime minister,"" she added. On March 19, Europe's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also announced he had been infected, while U.K. negotiator David Frost went into self-isolation around the same time after showing symptoms.

Johnson, 55, was moved to intensive care on Monday as his coronavirus symptoms worsened over the course of several hours, according to a statement from the government. He had announced on March 27 that he tested positive and was experiencing ""mild symptoms.""

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will temporarily take over the prime minister's duties while Johnson is hospitalized, the government said.

""Clearly with this move into intensive care, there is a desire to put extra precautions into place, (Johnson) clearly is not in a position to govern at the moment,"" Sloat said.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization came in at 1.3 billion euros ($1.41 billion) in the first quarter, a 19% increase from the same period last year, with the firm also confirming its earnings forecast for 2020.

""On our side the power generation business has very limited impact from the corona situation,"" Markus Krebber, RWE's chief financial officer, told CNBC on Thursday.

""Of course, we see muted power demand but usually our positions are hedged very well in advance and that is why we have seen, so far, very limited impact.""

Krebber went on to explain that the situation around the coronavirus was ""more challenging on the operational side.""

""We have to ensure security of supply, so the health and safety of our workforce is of top priority and we have taken very early pre-emptive measures to ensure that our people stay safe and that we are able, in all conditions, to provide power,"" he said.

RWE carried out a significant asset swap with E.ON last year in a deal valued at more than 40 billion euros. At the time, RWE explained that, going forward, its focus would primarily be on electricity generation ""based on renewables.""

On Thursday, the company noted it was planning to make net investments of around 5 billion euros to expand its renewables portfolio to more than 13 gigawatts by 2022. Krebber told CNBC that the ""shift in business model"" had made RWE's overall business mix ""much more robust.""

Published on Wednesday, the analysis — released by Environmental Entrepreneurs, the American Council on Renewable Energy, E4TheFuture, and BW Research Partnership — paints a stark picture for the industry and reflects the significant impact that the coronavirus pandemic is having on the overall U.S. economy.

Clean energy job losses in April were far greater than March, when 147,139 claims were made. Total claims for March and April amount to 594,347, or 17.8% of the sector's workforce.

For the purposes of the analysis, the term ""clean energy"" encompasses a range of areas: energy efficiency; renewables; grid and storage; and ""clean"" vehicles and fuels.

Overall, April saw a little over 310,000 people working in energy efficiency file for unemployment, while there were 71,835 job losses in renewables. California was the worst hit state, losing 77,860 clean energy jobs last month.

Looking ahead, the report forecasts more job losses unless the U.S. administration and Congress ""take quick and substantive action to support the clean energy industry and its workers.""

If no action is taken, it's projected that 850,000 people in the sector will have filed for unemployment by June 30.

""The economic data from April shows that the job losses from the COVID-19 pandemic are worse than expected,"" Phil Jordan, vice president and principal at BW Research Partnership, said in a statement.



""Unemployment claims increased dramatically across many key segments of the clean energy sector, such as construction and manufacturing,"" Jordan added. ""And the data does not suggest that we have yet to hit the bottom.""

Around the world, firms working in sectors such as renewable energy are having to adapt to the new challenges posed by Covid-19.

Last week, Nordex became the latest wind turbine manufacturer to withdraw guidance for the 2020 financial year.

For Americans, the economic impact of the virus has led to new categorizations of ""essential"" workers, a large-scale move to remote work and skyrocketing unemployment that is expected to continue increasing. With more than 30 million people filing for unemployment in the past six weeks, the U.S. is predicted to experience a coronavirus-induced recession through 2021. And amid stay-at-home orders across the country, office workers have ditched their daily commutes to work from dining room tables, couches and beds in their own homes. Many may find themselves in this situation for the long haul, as businesses struggle to find a path forward while restrictions slowly lift. But what other changes will we see in the coming months and years? CNBC Make It spoke to futurists, employment experts, CEOs, designers and more to find out how the pandemic could forever transform the way we work.

Working in an office could become a status symbol

Following the pandemic, it's likely that more Americans will split their time between working from home and from a corporate office, says Brent Capron, the design director of interiors at architecture firm Perkins and Will's New York studio. ""People will still gather for work,"" he says. ""But the amount of time you work in proximity with others, and what your work week looks like — I see that to be the biggest cultural shift moving forward."" With more people working remotely, companies may open regional hubs or provide access to co-working spaces wherever their workers are concentrated rather than have the majority of their workforce at one central office. As a result, corporate headquarters may become a status symbol for the companies that still have the budget and a workforce big enough to warrant pricey real estate in a major city. A company's investment in its headquarters could become a way to recruit talent, says Jane Oates, president of WorkingNation, a nonprofit campaign about unemployment, and a former assistant secretary at the Department of Labor. Job seekers may consider it a draw to work for a company with a physical location, which could boost brand awareness and overall influence within the industry.

Most meetings could be replaced by email and IM

Expect your post-pandemic work calendar to contain fewer meetings overall, says Nadjia Yousif, managing director and partner of Boston Consulting Group's London office. The pandemic has been a technological equalizer of sorts, she says, where people previously unaccustomed to using tech tools in the workplace have had no choice but to adapt. And in some cases, workers are becoming more efficient. ""People have been more patient in learning new technologies and engaging with them, simply because they've had to,"" Yousif says. ""I think those best practices will live on. I think we're all developing new muscles to work virtually."" To that end, expect a generally more agile way of working and communicating with colleagues: More meetings will become emails, and more emails will become instant messages. For team members who no longer work together in a central office, phone calls and meetings may move to video. This could help to build trust among workers who can't interact in person, Yousif says. When you're able to pick up on nonverbal cues, or you're invited into a colleague's home via video chat, ""a different type of intimacy is formed in a faster way than would happen in a traditional working environment,"" she says.

It could be the end of business travel as we know it

As travel of all kinds is halted, telecommuting is adopted at scale and companies attempt to cut costs and balance their budgets, many experts believe business trips as we know them will be a thing of the past. ""I don't think [business travel] is ever going to be exactly the same,"" says Gary Leff, a travel industry expert and author of the blog View from the Wing. Changing consumer preferences and greater interest in social distancing will limit large group events such as conferences and conventions for the foreseeable future, says Leff, and permanently decrease the volume of business travel. Additionally, Leff expects that during this time, companies will learn that some business travel is unnecessary and can be done via video meetings. He also points out as organizations attempt to recoup their pandemic-related losses, travel budgets will be cut.

Office buildings could become 'elaborate conference centers'

With the office building recast as the ultimate status symbol, its main purpose could shift. ""Does office space strictly become elaborate conference centers?"" asks Capron. He predicts office buildings of the future may become facilities to gather, while focused work is done remotely. This could mean fewer walled-off offices and more gathering spaces to host meetings, conferences and other company-wide events. Beyond that, the open office floor plan will likely stick around. Despite criticism that they kill productivity, it's likely companies will still use the layout in an effort to lower real estate costs. Open layouts will change, however: Desks could become spaced out, partitions could go up, cleaning stations stocked with hand sanitizer and antibacterial wipes will become the norm, and workers may seek out spaces for focused work, such as privacy booths. Capron stops short of saying cubicles will make a comeback. Agile workspaces with unassigned seating will decline in popularity. Workers will want the security and control of having a personal space they come to every day or every few days and can clean frequently. In shared spaces, expect more touchless fixtures, such as door sensors, automatic sinks and soap dispensers and voice-activated elevator banks. Architects may also design spaces with durable building materials, furniture, flooring and other surfaces that can stand up to frequent deep-cleaning, which is expected to be a lasting necessity of the future workplace for years to come.

Mandatory on-the-job medical screening could become the norm

Health and legal experts predict that on-the-job medical screening, such as temperature checks and antibody tests, will be a reality for those who return to work in the months ahead. And in many cases it's already happening: To combat the spread of coronavirus among essential workers, some of the biggest employers in the country, including Amazon, Walmart, Home Depot and Starbucks have begun taking the temperatures of their employees before they are allowed to work. According to labor and employment attorney David Barron, not only are employers legally permitted to check employees' temperatures, they are also currently being encouraged to do so by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""As long as employers don't discriminate — they can't pick and choose who is tested — it's absolutely legal."" It's also possible U.S. workers may be asked to show some form of ""immunity certificate,"" verifying that they have immunity to Covid-19, before they return to work, Barron says. This approach, in which workers take an antibody test to confirm that they have immunity, is being embraced in countries such as the United Kingdom, which is attempting to roll out an ""immunity passport"" program. However, some scientists have warned that it is yet to be scientifically proven that having antibodies for coronavirus gives a person immunity. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, has indicated that an ""immunity certificate"" program is ""being discussed."" ""It might actually have some merit under certain circumstances,"" he told CNN.

Coworkers could become even closer

If there's one bright spot to how the pandemic will impact the future of work, it's that it could strengthen the personal relationships we form with colleagues. ""For a long time, we've probably taken for granted the ability to see our coworkers every day and maybe didn't realize how valuable that was,"" says Lakshmi Rengarajan, a workplace connection consultant formerly of WeWork and Match.com. ""I think teams will be a lot closer when they're able to move back into the workplace."" Organizational psychologist, Wharton professor and ""Originals"" author Adam Grant agrees. He predicts that, as coworkers return to the office, they'll ditch previous messaging habits and actually get up, walk around and visit with each other in person. ""There will probably be fewer sad desk lunches,"" he says. Workplace friendships could flourish among colleagues who relied on each other during the pandemic and got to know one another on a more personal level. But despite more in-person interaction among colleagues, handshakes are on their way out. Fauci recently advised that handshaking needs to stop even when the pandemic ends, and other health experts agree. Rengarajan says gestures that can convey friendliness and respect from a distance, such as a nod or smile, could become the social norm. ""Maybe it's the rise of eye contact or listening,"" Rengarajan says. Read more: The pandemic has probably made you more vulnerable with coworkers—here's why that could be a good thing

Fashion-ready face masks could become a wardrobe staple

Though business casual will likely remain the norm in offices, two new types of apparel could also spring from the pandemic: The rise of work-from-home office wear, and face masks as a socially mandated accessory. Workers who video conference frequently may retool their wardrobe to be camera-friendly — more bold colors, large-scale patterns and clean lines; fewer neutrals, small prints and frills. ""If we are going to be mediating our professional lives on screens more, I think people will think more about how they appear on screen,"" says Natalie Nudell, a fashion and textiles historian faculty member at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. Wearing a face mask around the office may become commonplace, especially in bigger companies with more workers sharing tight quarters. This could be an opportunity for the textile industry to innovate how to make masks more protective, comfortable and stylish.

Standard 9-to-5 office hours could become a thing of the past

As professionals juggle the demands of work life and home life all in the same place, many employers have relaxed rules about workers starting and ending their days at a set time. ""I think you'll see a new norm around trust and respect"" in the ways employers manage their staff moving forward, says career coach Julie Kratz. With many employees successfully working from home now, it will be a lot harder for employers to deny flexibility around work hours and work settings, she explains. ""For most office-type work, you can absolutely do your work remotely, and with technology, you can build it around your schedule,"" adds Kratz, who says that many of her clients at tech companies such as Salesforce were already working flexible hours before the Covid-19 outbreak. To maintain a sense of structure, Kratz says employers will have to set expectations for when they need everyone in the office or online for staff meetings and other team activities. Additionally, she says, in order to create a balance between work time and personal time, employees and managers will have to work closely together to ensure that no one is feeling pressured to respond to emails and messages at all hours of the day. ""By all means, it's not about throwing out all the rules,"" she emphasizes, ""but it's about letting people co-create them.""

Home office stipends could become a common perk

When Twitter and e-commerce company Shopify issued mandatory work-from-home orders for employees in March, both employers provided staff with additional resources to help smooth the transition to remote work. At Shopify, workers were given a $1,000 stipend to purchase necessary supplies for their home office spaces. Meanwhile at Twitter, all employees, including hourly workers, received reimbursement for home office equipment including desks, chairs and ergonomic cushions. If working remotely becomes the norm, then home office stipends could become a common workplace perk, says bestselling author and futurist Jacob Morgan. In order for remote work to be effective, employers will have to provide employees with the resources needed to be productive, he explains. This includes a small stipend that will allow workers to ""customize their space in a way they think is sufficient."" This remote flexibility will also allow companies to ""save money on the overhead cost of running these massive facilities,"" career coach Julie Kratz adds. On average, employers that allow employees to work from home part-time save about $11,000 per year for each employee working remotely, according to research-based consulting firm Global Workplace Analytics. Using some of this money to invest in remote office setups ""will buy loyalty from your employees because it shows you care about them, you care about the ergonomics of their situation at home and you want them to be happy and productive,"" Kratz says.

The workplace could become more equitable for women

With many workplaces now being forced to operate remotely, long-term flexibility could be here to stay, allowing more women to remain in the workforce while balancing home and work life, says Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. This change in workplace structure could have a huge impact on women, as they are more likely than men to adjust their careers for family. In fact, roughly 31% of women who took a career break after having kids said they didn't want to but had to because of a lack of employer flexibility, according to a 2019 FlexJobs survey of more than 2,000 women with children under 18. This break, according to PayScale, can easily cost women tens of thousands of dollars when lost wages, future wage growth and lost retirement and Social Security contributions are added up. A more flexible work culture could also create more equity at home as both men and women are able to spend quality time with their families. ""You're going to see more men starting to want these [flexible options] too, assuming they enjoyed the time at home with their kids,"" Kratz says. Though a wider variety of work options won't solve all of our equity issues, other countries show it is possible to create a more gender-balanced culture. ""You can see this in Scandinavian countries, for example; they offer this flexibility,"" Kratz says. ""You see gender equality is much higher in those countries as a result."" Read more: Why long-term flexible work options could be a game changer for women

Middle management positions could be cut forever

In the months and years ahead, we could continue to see a hollowing out of middle management. ""One of the big things that happened during the 2008 global financial crisis is that organizations pulled out all sorts of layers of middle management, which actually makes it harder to get promoted,"" says Brian Kropp, vice president at research firm Gartner. That's one reason wage growth was sluggish, he says, even as the economy reached new heights: Workers were not promoted to middle-management roles as frequently, since so many were eliminated during the recession. It's possible we may see a similar dynamic post-pandemic, says John Sculley, who served as Apple's CEO from 1983 to 1993. ""A lot of organizations are going to say, 'Wait a minute, we don't really need all these layers of middle management that we had in the past,'"" Sculley, currently chairman of pharmacy benefit management company RxAdvance, tells CNBC Make It. Others are more optimistic that the demand for top-tier managers will rebound once the pandemic subsides because organizations will want to emphasize productivity. One fear of a flattening management structure is that fewer managers will be required to oversee a higher volume of direct reports, creating room for error, lack of oversight and mismanagement. ""I personally think good managers are always going to be in demand,"" says Oates. ""You can't have a good workforce unless you have good managers.""

Automation could be accelerated

While futurists have long warned of ""job-stealing robots,"" the coronavirus pandemic has heightened fears that automation will replace the jobs of workers. Because of social distancing measures, many organizations — from restaurants to retailers — have been forced to find ways to operate with as few employees physically present as possible. An added bonus: Robots and algorithms can't get sick. Coronavirus ""has caused an acceleration of some labor trends like automation,"" says Karen Fichuk, CEO of Randstad North America, adding that out-of-work Americans may need to develop new skills in order to find new jobs. ""What we're seeing is this significant need for massive up-skilling and retraining, especially for workers who have been laid off."" Jake Schwartz, co-founder and CEO of General Assembly, agrees that coronavirus will accelerate automation. ""It's pulling the future forward,"" he says. For years, companies have been working toward automating repetitive jobs through algorithms that can complete administrative tasks, robots that can streamline manufacturing and drones that can deliver goods. And researchers have found that this kind of automation is more quickly adopted during economic downturns. ""Companies are going to be going digital much faster, they're going to be automating much faster. And in that context, are we looking at mass unemployment? We don't know,"" says Schwartz.

Ron Navarro is a self-described ""late bloomer"" when it comes to money. The now-30-year-old didn't really pay attention to his finances, he says, until he went to nursing school in the Philippines in 2010 at age 20. It took living — and budgeting — on his own in another country for him to get his money into shape. The Philippines shaped his financial viewpoint in other ways, too. Though he moved back to Michigan, six years ago, he still mostly uses cash to pay for things, he says, which is common in the Philippines. He splits his household expenses with his mother, Gertrudes, and his wife, Carmela. Everyone contributes what they can, and there's rarely arguments over who bought what, or who pitched in more or less. ""One thing about the Philippines is that not a lot of people have credit cards,"" he says. ""Even though people there might not have as much money, they really don't have debt. They help each other out as a family.""

That family mentality also shapes how Navarro approaches his work in the U.S. As a registered nurse in the emergency department of DMC Detroit Receiving Hospital, Navarro is on the frontlines of the pandemic in one of the hardest-hit regions in the country. ""People are passing away with loved ones on the phone. They're usually alone,"" Navarro told CNBC Make It in April, just as the city's daily Covid cases and deaths were beginning to fall. ""We're the ones that take place of their loved ones. It's been especially difficult to see patients enter the hospital ""walking and talking,"" he says, only to be intubated – the term used when a person has a tube inserted to help them breathe — and unresponsive a few hours later. But he views it as his duty to care for the community no matter the circumstances, referencing the Florence Nightingale Pledge for nurses, which puts the welfare of the community before individuals.

""I have seen and heard of coworkers, veteran nurses [and] doctors who teared up, something that you don't really see,"" he says. In the E.R. ""people there are pretty tough. And we have to be because we see a lot of things."" It helps, he says, that he is eligible for overtime pay. Navarro earned around $90,000 pre-tax last year with overtime. In the first few weeks of the outbreak, he worked 12-hour shifts, four-to-five days per week. Recently, though, he's scaled back his time to his regular schedule of three, 12-hour days per week at the behest of his mother and wife, who worry about his exposure to the virus. He estimates he'll make around the same amount this year. Navarro's mother came to the United States from the Philippines in the 1970s, and she was a nurse at the same hospital where her son works. She retired in 2014. One of the big differences between their experiences, he says, is that his mother receives a pension from the hospital, which the family puts toward their bills. Navarro will not receive that when he retires, as it's no longer offered to hospital employees.

But that doesn't bother Navarro. It's a blessing to be able to do what he loves while earning decent money. ""I love nursing, taking care of people,"" he says. ""It's an honor to be helping those in need.""

Living and working in Michigan

Navarro lives in the house he grew up in in Troy, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, with Carmela and his mother. He splits many of his monthly expenses with his wife and mother, and the exact breakdown of who pays for what depends on the month. ""It is actually pretty common for Asians, and for Filipinos, to pass down what they have,"" he says.

Though his mother and father had paid off the house before they gave it to their son, Navarro decided to renovate it in 2015. The couple also purchased a condo in the Philippines in 2018, where Carmela grew up and where Navarro lived for four years while he attended nursing school. He feels like rushing the home renovation is not only his biggest financial mistake, but he admits it's the biggest fight he's had about money with Carmela and his mother. He took out a $180,000 mortgage on his house, and used $100,000 for renovations and $80,000 to buy an income property in the Philippines, which he plans to rent out to earn extra money.

""Sometimes that's how I am. When I want something, I do everything at once,"" he says. In hindsight, he wishes he had padded his emergency fund more instead of spending so much renovating the house, but as the family is still living well within their means, he's giving himself grace for the hasty decision making. Navarro completely remodeled the first floor of the house, ripping out carpet and wood paneling from the 1970s, and adding new appliances to the kitchen. They also updated the landscaping and added a new staircase to the basement. Now, he's in a comfortable spot. With his salary, his wife's income (Carmela works in accounts receivable for Beaumont Health Systems in Detroit) and his mother's pension, the family makes well above the $97,000 median household income for his area.

They are also able to send $300 to Carmela's family in the Philippines every month. They have helped send both of her younger siblings to college. Navarro thinks of it as repayment for the help and support the family provided him when he lived in the Philippines for four years. ""I can never pay them back fully,"" he adds. ""Like the saying goes, money doesn't buy happiness, but it sure can help.""

How the Navarro family budgets

So far, the pandemic has done little to change the family's budget. His wife is still working, and Navarro is bringing in more money than usual thanks to overtime.

Even before the pandemic, Navarro and his wife spent most of their time at home: Because of his atypical work schedule, they went out once every other weekend at most. ""My wife and I, we don't really buy a lot of stuff,"" he says, aside from travel — the couple went to Japan last year — and their two cars, which they hope to pay off in full this summer. The couple put their stimulus relief checks in their emergency fund. Here's the family's estimated monthly spending as of May 2020:

CNBC Make It

Savings: $1,600

$1,600 Housing: $1,515

$1,515 Transportation: $1,232 for car and truck payments, gas

$1,232 for car and truck payments, gas Insurance: $902 for car, dental, health, life

$902 for car, dental, health, life Food: $600

$600 Utilities : $480

: $480 Family support: $300

$300 Phone: $150

$150 Subscriptions: $71 for Amazon Prime, his gym, Netflix, etc. While Navarro is the breadwinner, the three family members split monthly expenses between themselves. His mother helps with groceries, for example, and pays for her own medical expenses. ""We all pitch in in our own ways,"" he says. ""We just all help each other out."" Navarro personally saves $1,600 per month: $400 goes to his liquid savings account, $700 is invested in his 401(k) and he invests an additional $500 in a Roth IRA. He has $1,400 in savings and nearly $40,000 saved for retirement.

After that, his family's biggest expense is housing, including a $50 monthly fee for their condo in the Philippines (the rest of the condo is paid off) and the monthly mortgage payment on their home in Troy. They also pay around $480 per month for cable, Wi-Fi, heat, electricity and other utilities. The family of three spends around $600 on food, mostly on groceries to prepare meals at home.

What the experts say

CNBC Make It asked Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz, president of Charles Schwab Foundation and certified financial planner, to comment on what Navarro is doing right with his money and where he could improve.

Schwab-Pomerantz is impressed with where Navarro stands now. ""With zero credit card balance, the investment property paid off, and his vehicles almost paid off, Ron is in a great position to secure his financial future,"" she tells CNBC Make It. Contributing to both a 401(k) and Roth IRA is a great way to have diversified income streams in retirement, she says. He should keep that up as long as he can. And while he's saving a not-insignificant portion of his salary now, she says increasing the ""buffer"" of his savings account should be his priority going forward. This is especially true with an investment property to take care of — where unexpected costs may creep up — and with the family contributions he and Carmela are making.

""When Ron finishes paying off his cars, he should consider increasing his savings rates that much more,"" she says, which means he could save an additional $900 or more a month. Carmela, too, ""can contribute earnings to her own retirement accounts."" Finally, Schwab-Pomerantz says it's crucial for Navarro to put his mental and physical health first, especially in such a demanding field. Overtime pay is great, but he also needs to take time for himself and his family. ""While Ron has opportunities for over-time as a registered nurse, it's important that he takes care of his health and doesn't overdo it,"" she says. ""Taking care of his mental and physical health is the best way for Ron to protect his earnings potential and continue taking care of his family, and patients.""

Victoria Leta, 28, a graphic designer living in Brooklyn, bought a Costco membership one year ago and shares it with her boyfriend. They go to the store every two weeks, and Leta says they haven't been bothered by purchase limits in place on items such as bottled water and toilet paper. ""The purchase limits have not affected us, really, but that's because we are only buying for ourselves,"" she says. ""The Kirkland brand toilet paper can last us months."" At Costco.com, a 30-roll pack of Kirkland toilet paper retails for $20. By calculations from howmuchtoiletpaper.com, a 30-roll pack could last a four-person household 40 days. Vinny Tung, a 25-year-old real estate developer in Washington, D.C., also visits Costco once every two weeks. ""I got my first Costco membership when I was in college and I've had it ever since,"" he says. The purchase limits haven't really affected him, either. If anything, the quarantine has resulted in him having a surplus of food. ""Prequarantine, I used to go with some of my friends, but in my current situation, I definitely do not,"" he says.

If you shop smart, you can cut down on food waste

Although Tung has found himself buying a bit more than he can realistically consume, Leta says the quarantine has prompted her to use everything she purchases from Costco. ""To have abundance in this crisis is pure luck and a privilege, and having a Costco membership right now sure as hell is just that,"" she says. Before the pandemic, Leta and her boyfriend would get ""a few staples and a few novelty snacks and coffee,"" but inevitably certain items would always expire before she could use them. ""You buy some perishables and end up going out to eat,"" she says. ""You could get bored with the resources you already had and buy others. It seems so silly now. There is a lot less food waste now that we are cooking everything and being more resourceful with what we have before going out to replenish.""

Social distancing makes for a smooth shopping experience

After the shelter-in-place order came down in New York City, Leta and her boyfriend stood in a long line for their local Costco. Her anxiety grew, she says, as she heard other shoppers talk about possible product shortages and people they knew who were infected by the coronavirus. But upon entering, she was relieved to see that the store wasn't at all packed with people. ""Getting in and shopping at Costco was quite peaceful,"" she says. ""Since they've limited the amount of customers in the store, you're able to move your cart around with ease and avoid bumping into someone."" As the shelter-in-place orders persist and Americans adjust to the new normal, some shoppers find there aren't long waits, either. ""I just went yesterday and there was no line,"" Tung says. ""A month and a half ago when this all started, I went and was like, 'Oh god, this is kind of crazy,' and I left the scene and came back another time.""

Count hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio among the skeptics. ""We're not going to go back to normal,"" Dalio tells CNBC Make It. But he also has hope. ""Soon we are going to reconsider how we are going to divide the pie and there are reasons that it won't be good for capitalists,"" Dalio says.

The closest parallel is the Great Depression

How bad could it get

While the Great Depression lasted for several years, Dalio has contended that the current downturn could be ""relatively brief"" in comparison, but the recovery period — how long it takes for the economy to return to its previous growth trajectory — could take ""three, four, or five years,"" he says. And there are still reasons to be optimistic that the effects of this downturn on the average individual person will not be as dire as during the Great Depression, economists have noted, when the sight of bread lines full of hungry people was common and homeless encampments, aka ""Hoovervilles,"" popped up throughout the country. For instance, even with unemployment numbers soaring, some companies and industries have pivoted to keep working and sectors like health and e-commerce are still hiring, and staffing agencies expect more companies will begin adding jobs again once manufacturing starts to reopen around the country. Perhaps most importantly, though, there are numerous social safety net programs that exist today, however flawed, like unemployment insurance, food stamps and Social Security, that did not exist yet during the Great Depression, and which should help many Americans stay afloat even during a major downturn. (And, some policy experts have argued that the current crisis offers an opportunity to further bolster some of those existing programs.) Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told The Wall Street Journal that, while the current downturn is likely to be painful, it should be shorter than the Great Depression. ""Many people are suffering now, and the economy won't recover in only a quarter or two,"" Bernanke said. ""But if we're able to get reasonable control of the virus, the economy will substantially recover, and this downturn should be much shorter than the Great Depression.""

As one of those students, my commute has been reduced to the time it takes for me to boot up my laptop, my classrooms have transformed into Zoom calls and many class conversations now take place on discussion boards. Tackling internships has also become a new kind of challenge in this virtual era. For many students, myself included, internships are a vital way to learn and gain experience outside of the classroom in the fields they're studying. This semester, I'm interning at CNBC Make It as an editorial intern. It's a position I started in person, and though I'm typing from home today, the work itself is largely unchanged. I still check my emails daily, research topics and reach out to sources from home. Despite not working in a traditional office environment, I still wanted to make the most of the experience. I also spoke with Barbara Safani, owner of Career Solvers, a career management firm based in New York City, about how students can make the most of any virtual internship experience.

Some tasks are easier to complete from home than others, Safani told me. Work that requires analysis, research, communication or preparation of documents can be well-suited for a remote internship. But ultimately, ""really any internship can work at home, as long as the person doing the internship is receiving some sort of consistent guidance and feedback from somebody on staff,"" she says. I have found this to be true during my experience at CNBC Make It. The work challenges are the same regardless of whether I'm at home or in the office. Two things that have made a huge difference for me while working from home are transparency from my supervisor and helpful feedback on my ideas and work. Even across a significantly longer distance, I haven't struggled with miscommunication. Here's what it's been like to transition to a virtual internship and tips for how to be a great intern, even from a distance.

The perks of a virtual internship

When I think about the time I spent in office, I always go back to the first day of my internship. I'd been surprised to feel my ears pop in the elevator as it climbed up some thirty stories high and still recall the feeling of trepidation that set in as it halted abruptly for me to exit. My new desk was adorned with a welcome sign and offered a view of the surrounding skyscrapers. The day started with an office tour that turned into a blur of warm welcomes and introductions. I did my best to memorize the many names I heard and chart a map of the office layout in my mind. But it wasn't long until I adjusted to office life. I checked in with the coworkers who who sat closest to me and slowly learned about how they each contribute to Make It. When I compare the experience of working in an office versus working remotely, what I miss the most is all the little incidental conversations I had: small talk by the coffee machine and by-the-way questions that don't happen as frequently now. Today, my desk is a dining room table and my cats have become my coworkers. But I've still learned a lot and found advantages to working remotely. I'm able to focus on the digital aspects of my work with fewer distractions, and I've become a more effective communicator during non-visual interactions. I word my questions carefully and really think about how they will be perceived before I ask them.

Safani agrees that there are a number of advantages to virtual internships. For tech-savvy students, this is a great opportunity to showcase your technological skills and provide support for your coworkers, she says. Shy or introverted students might benefit from working remotely because you won't face ""all of the same kind of visual representation of office life and power."" ""It creates a very even playing field,"" Safani says. ""In some ways, it might help somebody who is somewhat introverted or shy because it might be less intimidating. If they're comfortable with the virtual environment, that's going work to their advantage."" Transitioning from working in a traditional office environment to working remotely wasn't easy, but I was able to problem solve and adapt along the way. Soon, this new type of work setting started to feel abundantly more natural to me.

How to succeed in a virtual internship

This summer, many students will be embarking on virtual internship experiences. Here are three tips for making the most of your program, regardless of what field you will be working in. 1. Show that you already know how to work remotely If you are applying to virtual internships right now, a remote interview is the perfect opportunity to showcase how you've adapted to a virtual learning environment at school, since many of the skills you've gained studying remotely will be transferable to a remote professional experience, Safani says.

People applying for internships need to view it from the lens of, 'How do I prove to an employer that I can work remotely and be successful? And what are the examples I have to prove that?' Barbara Safani Career Solvers, Owner

""In any interview, it's all about showing what experience the candidate has in the past that will help benefit them when they go to a new company,"" Safani says. ""The twist on it now is that people applying for internships need to view it from the lens of, How do I prove to an employer that I can work remotely and be successful? What are the examples I have to prove that?"" 2. Focus on communication It might be easy to feel discouraged if you didn't anticipate this type of internship experience when you applied. But it doesn't have to be any less exciting just because it's online, Safani says. Focus on making the most of the learning experiences available and communicate clearly with your new team members, she says. Even though you aren't working together in person, interns can prove themselves as valuable team members by thinking proactively about how they can approach tasks and problems and by showing that they are able to take on additional responsibilities and challenges.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

But surprisingly, many Americans aren't taking this approach during the global coronavirus pandemic. New credit card applications were down 40% from the first week of March to the last week, according to a new report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) Consumer Credit Panel. The report looked at hard inquiry data, or the number of times consumers' credit was pulled for an application. Results revealed that the credit card industry is not the only one seeing a drop; auto loan inquiries have decreased by 52% and mortgage inquiries by 27%. What's a hard inquiry? Each time you apply for credit, the lender will perform a ""hard inquiry"" or ""soft inquiry."" Hard inquiries are the most common and appear on your credit report after you submit an application, which may ding your credit score temporarily. Meanwhile, soft inquiries have no effect on your credit. The CFPB cited that this sharp drop in new inquiries could be due to a lowered demand for credit (people are spending less), or a drop in credit supply that may indirectly or directly raise consumers' expectation of being turned down for credit. In other words — consumers expect it will be harder to qualify for credit or a loan, given the number of banks scaling back on lending during the market's current conditions.

Why people with higher credit scores are applying for fewer cards

Suprisingly, card applications declined significantly more for consumers with super prime scores (above a 780 VantageScore) compared to consumers with deep subprime scores (below 500), at a rate of 59% and 34%, respectively. The CFPB pointed out that while all types of inquiries declined notably, consumers with higher credit scores had the most substantial drop. This could indicate they have more flexibility in substituting new credit applications with other means of financial support, such as emergency savings or passive income. Regardless if you have savings or not, you may still want to apply for a credit card. A new card can provide an extended credit limit, which is something you may need if you've recently been laid off or had your credit limit reduced without notice. It could also reward you with cash back for stocking up on groceries and streaming Netflix. But before you apply for a new credit card, we review some tips below.

Investors have been fleeing European and emerging market funds in favor of U.S.-based exchange-traded funds in recent months, with European ETFs seeing record outflows in March amid the volatility.

Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors, said that while non-U.S. stock-based ETFs lost roughly $19 billion over the last three months, ""U.S.-targeted strategies"" attracted roughly $57 billion.

""It was really driven by the outflows … out of the European-focused ETFs,"" Bartolini told CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" on Monday. ""I think basically what investors are doing here is ostensibly following Warren Buffett's advice and just buying America.""

Buffett has expressed optimism over the U.S. economy's ability to withstand the damage done by the coronavirus pandemic, telling Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in a recent virtual meeting that ""Nothing can basically stop America.""

The billionaire investor has long backed U.S. investments as havens in times of crisis, writing in a 2008 op-ed in The New York Times that he had ""been buying American stocks.""

""There's really no preference from investors to express a risk-on view overseas given that the economic and fundamental foundations are not as strong as they are in the U.S.,"" Bartolini said.

And though he acknowledged that ""weak performance, the constructive relative valuations of non-U.S. equity markets and low levels of positioning ... set up international to be a big contrarian call right now,"" Bartolini found one big issue with that strategy.

""Unfortunately, that was the same call for the last few years and it has yet to pan out,"" he said. ""I think if investors do want to sort of step into that market ... firms with higher-quality balance sheets that do trade at inexpensive valuations may be worth a flier just because they might have some more fundamental rigor to withstand any degradation in earnings and economic growth.
