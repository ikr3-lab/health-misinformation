News,2020-05-20,['Andrew Romano'],"As more states reopen, Georgia defies predictions of coronavirus resurgence. What's the lesson for the rest of the country?",https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Vg3gnOk5krK8rxXXim6GQQ--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xMzQ0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-05/4814d610-9ab3-11ea-abee-40b7dcf1f735,"On April 24, as more than 25,000 Americans continued to test positive for COVID-19 each day, Georgia became the first U.S. state to initiate the fraught process known as “reopening.”

First it allowed hair salons, gyms, barber shops, tattoo parlors and bowling alleys to resume operations. Dine-in restaurants and movie theaters followed a few days later.

Today much of the state is open for business, under guidelines including a 6-foot social distancing rule.

The move was controversial, to say the least. In the New York Times, Keren Landman, an Atlanta-based physician, epidemiologist and journalist, accused Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of potentially “setting us up for a punishing new wave of infections” by volunteering Georgia as “the nation’s canary in this particularly terrifying coal mine.”

Even President Trump said he “disagree[d] strongly with [Kemp’s] decision.”

But now 26 days have passed since the state started to reopen — and that punishing new wave of infections has not materialized. In fact, according to a database maintained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Georgia’s rolling seven-day average of new daily cases — an important metric that helps to balance out daily fluctuations in reporting — has fallen for three weeks in a row.

Those figures are undisputed — despite a clumsy effort by state officials to present the data in a way that made them look even better. And they are a lot better than the experience in two other states that are moving to end lockdowns, Florida and Texas.

For the seven-day period ending on May 4, Georgia’s daily average stood at 746 cases.

By May 11, the average had fallen 12.6 percent to 652 daily cases.

By May 18, it had dropped to 612 cases, a further decline of 6.1 percent.

At the same time, Georgia’s seven-day average of COVID-19 hospitalizations fell from 1,432 on May 4, to 1,239 on May 11, to 1,049 on May 18 — a three-week decline of 26.7 percent.

The numbers reflect a slowing in transmission. According to the AJC database, Rt — an epidemiological statistic that represents transmissibility, or the number of people a sick person infects at a particular point in an epidemic — fell from 1.0 on May 4, to 0.94 on May 11, to 0.88 on May 16. An Rt below 1 indicates that each person infects, on average, less than one other person.

So does Georgia’s experience mean the canary has survived the coal mine? And if so, what would the state’s survival mean for the rest of America?

To one degree or another, all 50 states have now started to reopen. But the process has advanced slowly, in fits and starts — especially in the Northeast and on the West Coast, where Democratic governors have tended to be more cautious than their Republican counterparts in the South, the Midwest and the Mountain West.

Ultimately, the answer to whether other states should follow Georgia’s lead and reopen more fully is that it depends.

According to the latest data, it’s true that Georgia’s seemingly premature reopening hasn’t produced a surge of new cases … yet.

That yet is important. The coronavirus doesn’t just disappear on its own. Wherever and whenever people interact — especially indoors, for an extended period of time, at a distance of less than 6 feet, without wearing a mask — it will have an opportunity to spread. Georgia is not some magical exception. It is entirely possible that the curve there will start bending upward instead of downward in the coming weeks, especially if residents get a false sense of security and really let down their guard.

But 26 days is enough time to draw some tentative conclusions. When positive-looking data started to emerge from Georgia shortly after reopening, experts were quick to note that its declining daily case counts were actually a window into the past. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the virus can incubate for up to 14 days before symptoms begin (though research shows the vast majority develop symptoms in less than 11.5 days). Then a patient has to get tested. Then a lab has to process that test. Then that lab has to send back a positive result. Then that result has to be reported to public health authorities. The upshot is that the first two weeks of post-reopening numbers still reflect the state of the epidemic before reopening. It’s only in Week 3 or so — i.e., now — that they even start to reveal anything about the impact of lifting lockdown.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

Rebekah Jones, the architect behind the Sunshine State’s interactive COVID-19 dashboard once praised by the White House, told several news outlets on Tuesday she was removed from her position as Graphic Information Systems manager on May 5 due to “reasons beyond my division’s control.” On Monday, the state’s Department of Health offered her a settlement with the option to resign instead of being fired, which would go into effect on May 26, she said.

Jones, 30, told CBS12 News that her involuntary removal came one day after she refused to “manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.” The scientist, however, did not elaborate on which data in particular she refused to alter.

States Are Starting to Reopen Amid the Coronavirus Pandemic. Here Are Their Plans.

To date, nearly 2,000 Floridians have died and 46,442 have been diagnosed with the coronavirus. Despite the ongoing public health issue, Gov. Ron Desantis announced last week his plan to open up Florida’s virus-stricken economy.

The news of Jones’ ouster was first revealed in a May 5 farewell email she sent to researchers and members of the public who signed up to receive updates on the data portal. In the email, Jones said her department was no longer responsible for updating information on the site “in any shape or form.”

“As a word of caution, I would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency that I made central to the process during the first two months. After all, my commitment to both is largely (arguably entirely) the reason I am no longer managing it,” Jones wrote. “They are making a lot of changes. I would advise being diligent in your respective uses of this data.”

The COVID-19 Data and Surveillance Dashboard provides daily updates on the numbers of deaths, new cases, and tests for every county in the state. Seen as one of the leading trackers in the state, the portal is heavily relied upon by officials, academics, and residents as Florida moves toward restarting the economy three months after issuing a stay-at-home order.

According to internal emails obtained by the Tampa Bay Times, reporters contacted the department on May 4 about a field of data that showed when residents first began to report their virus symptoms or testing positive. The data, according to the emails, showed that Floridians were experiencing symptoms as early as Jan. 1—three months earlier than when the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in the state.

That field of data vanished from the portal several hours later, the Times reported. Then, at around 5 p.m. on May 5, Department of Health I.T. Director Craig Curry messaged Jones asking her to “disable the ability to export data” from the interactive COVID-19 site.

“Per Dr. Blackmore, disable the ability to export the data to files from the dashboard immediately,” Curry wrote, referring to Dr. Carina Blackmore, the director of the Division of Disease Control and Health Protection in Florida. “We need to ensure that dates (date fields) in all objects match their counterpart on the PDF line list published.”

Minutes later, Jones responded saying “this is the wrong call” before complying with the request. About an hour later, at 6 p.m. on May 5, the I.T. director emailed both Jones and Blackmore asking them to “re-enable” the ability to export data “for now.”

The Florida Department of Health did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment.

“Allegations that Florida’s government may have tried to manipulate or alter data to make reopening appear safer is outrageous. These kinds of actions are dangerous and, frankly, should be criminal,” Terrie Rizzo, chair of the Florida Democratic Party, said in a Tuesday statement to The Daily Beast. “An independent investigation into these allegations is needed immediately. Meanwhile, city and state officials across Florida should closely monitor the situation to protect the public’s health.”",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

The risk is that politicians, business owners and ordinary Americans who are making decisions about lockdowns, reopenings and other day-to-day matters could be left with the impression that the virus is under more control than it actually is.

In Virginia, Texas and Vermont, for example, officials said they have been combining the results of viral tests, which show an active infection, with antibody tests, which show a past infection.

Public health experts say that can make for impressive-looking testing totals but does not give a true picture of how the virus is spreading.

In Florida, the data scientist who developed the state’s coronavirus dashboard, Rebekah Jones, said this week that she was fired for refusing to manipulate data “to drum up support for the plan to reopen”.

Global coronavirus cases and deaths (PA Graphics) More

In Georgia, one of the earliest states to ease up on lockdowns and assure the public it was safe to go out again, the Department of Public Health published a graph about May 11 that showed new Covid-19 cases declining over time in the most severely affected counties.

The daily entries, however, were not arranged in chronological order but in descending order.

For example, the May 7 totals came right before April 26, which was followed by May 3. A quick look at the graph made it appear as if the decline was smoother than it really was.

The graph was taken down within about a day.

Georgia state Democrat Jasmine Clark, who has a doctorate in microbiology, said the graph was a “prime example of malfeasance”.

“Sadly it feels like there’s been an attempt to make the data fit the narrative, and that’s not how data works,” she said.

Republican Governor Brian Kemp’s office denied there was any attempt to deceive the public.

Spokeswoman Candice Broce insisted that the governor’s office is not telling the department what to do and that officials are not trying to dress up the data to make Mr Kemp look better, saying that “could not be further from the truth”.

As for the May 11 graph, Ms Broce said public health officials were trying to highlight which days had seen the highest peaks of infections.

“It was not intended to mislead,” Ms Broce said on Tuesday. “It was always intended to be helpful.”

Federal guidelines say that before states begin reopening, they should see a 14-day downward trend in infections.

However, some states have reopened when infections were still climbing or had plateaued.

States have also been instructed to expand testing and contact tracing.

The US has recorded 1.5 million confirmed infections and over 90,000 deaths.

Vermont and Virginia said they stopped combining the two types of tests in the past few days.

Still, health officials in Virginia, where Democratic Governor Ralph Northam has eased up on restrictions, said that combining the numbers caused “no difference in overall trends”.

In Texas, where health officials said last week that they were including some antibody results in their testing totals and case counts, Republican Governor Greg Abbott said on Monday that the numbers were not being commingled.

Health officials did not respond to requests for clarification.

Georgia’s Department of Public Health also regularly publishes a graph that shows cases over time, except new infections are not listed on the day they came back positive, which is the practice in many other states.

Instead, Georgia lists new cases on the day the patient first reported symptoms.

That practice can shift the timeline of the outbreak and make it appear as if the state is moving past the peak.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

Dan Levy, the co-creator and star of “Schitt’s Creek,” is seeking to defuse tensions surrounding wearing face masks amid the coronavirus pandemic.

In a clip the actor shared online Tuesday, he called on people who are “actively not wearing masks because they perceive it to be an infringement of their freedom” to recontextualize it as “the simplest, easiest act of kindness that you can do in a day.”

Levy acknowledged “the frustration of being told what to do” but said reframing may save the lives of people with autoimmune issues who could suffer “devastating repercussions” if they contracted COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.

“See it not as anyone or anything infringing on your freedom, but rather, if you have the freedom to leave your house, if you have the good health to leave your house, why not put on a mask?” Levy asked. “Make it your good deed for the day and do something nice for yourself and other people.”

Check out Levy’s video here:

MSNBC’s Chris Hayes last week noted how “not wearing a mask has kind of become a sort of weird, culture war virtue-signaling by Trump people.”

President Donald Trump himself has repeatedly refused to wear one, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommending “wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain” and “especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.”

In the UK, 248,818 people have tested positive for the virus, and 545 deaths were recorded on Tuesday, pushing the death toll to 35,341.

Here is your daily briefing of coronavirus news you may have missed overnight.

The 100-year-old Second World War veteran who raised millions for the NHS during lockdown is to be knighted.

NHS porters and cleaners and social care staff do not qualify for a Home Office scheme that grants families of health workers indefinite leave to remain in the UK if they die of coronavirus, it was revealed.

The GMB union said the exclusion of some of the NHS’s lowest paid workers was an “outrageous scandal”.

Around 8 per cent of social care home workers are non-EU migrants, who also make up a large number of those who work as hospital cleaners, porters, security guards and catering staff who are considered key workers but have been left out of the scheme.

Lola McEvoy, NHS organiser for the GMB union, called the policy “heartless” and said it leaves the lowest-paid key workers “out in the cold”.

“We ask them to take the maximum risk – but they get minimal reward. They have been drafted to the front of the fight on Covid-19 and if – as so many have – they lose their lives in doing so, their families are not looked after,” she said.

“It’s only right that they’re offered the same security and peace of mind as directly-employed NHS staff – after all they face the same dangers.”

An extra bank holiday to be put in place in October is reportedly being considered by the government as a way to help the tourism industry recover from the repercussions of coronavirus.

The UK’s tourism agency Visit Britain put forward the proposal for an extra day off near half-term, reported the BBC.

The government told the BBC it will ‘respond in due course” to the agency’s proposal, but warned that having an extra break does “come with economic costs”.

Head of Visit Britain, Patricia Yates, reportedly argued that an extra bank holiday in October would help the industry mitigate the benefits lost from the two bank holidays in May, as people remained in lockdown at the time.

UK Hospitality, a trade group for leisure businesses, also supported the idea of an extra bank holiday, but expressed caution.

Chief executive Kate Nicholls told the BBC: “A bank holiday in October may provide a welcome boost for hospitality businesses, not least at a time when consumer confidence will hopefully be returning to healthy levels.

“However, we are still some way from knowing what the sector will look like. A lot depends on whether businesses are able to open safely and whether the government continue to support businesses who need it.”

The University of Cambridge will hold all “face-to-face lectures” virtually until the next academic year, it has confirmed.

The university becomes the first to set out such measures for the full 2020/21 academic year and it says it is “likely” that social distancing will continue to be required.

However, it may be possible for smaller teaching groups to take place in person if it “conforms to social distancing requirements”.

A spokesman for the university said: “The University is constantly adapting to changing advice as it emerges during this pandemic.

“Given that it is likely that social distancing will continue to be required, the university has decided there will be no face-to-face lectures during the next academic year.

“This decision has been taken now to facilitate planning, but as ever, will be reviewed should there be changes to official advice on coronavirus.”

A leaked Pentagon draft memo says that the US should expect for the coronavirus pandemic to last until the summer of 2021, according to those that have seen it.

The Department of Defence document, obtained by Task & Purpose, advises the that the military prepare for a “globally-persistent” Covid-19 environment with no effective vaccine until “at least the summer of 2021.

Authored by Secretary of Defence Mark Esper, though not finalised or signed by him, the memo warns against any complacency that the virus will now be easily defeated: “We have a long path ahead, with the real possibility of a resurgence of Covid-19.”

It continues: “Therefore we must now refocus our attention on resuming critical missions, increasing levels of activity, and making necessary preparations should a significant resurgence of Covid-19 occur later this year.”

These preparations are likely to include the repositioning of forces and supplies in a faster-paced summer move cycle in which personnel are redeployed domestically and internationally.

Task & Purpose reports that the memo was prepared by Kenneth Rapuano, assistant secretary of defence for homeland defence and global security. It is intended as an update to a 1 April guidance document issued by Mr Esper.

A Pentagon spokesperson said that the new document is outdated. Indeed, since early May it had been circulated among the various branches of the military for feedback, a source told Task & Purpose. It is unclear if Mr Esper has yet seen the document.

Pentagon sources confirmed to The Hill that there are versions of plans with similar language to the leaked memo, but none have been approved. Senior officials are also discussing plans to continue with the summer 2020 move cycle — also not yet finalised.

“All indications suggest we will be operating in a globally-persistent Covid-19 environment in the months ahead,” the memo reads. “This will likely continue until there is wide-scale immunity, through immunisation, and some immunity post-recovery from the virus.”

As well as predicting no viable treatment or vaccine until next summer at the earliest, the scenario laid out by the Pentagon assumes successive waves of infection in clusters tied to seasonal flu outbreaks; continued shortages of personal protective equipment; and testing not being able to completely assure an absence of the virus, and therefore requiring extensive contact tracing and monitoring.

As recently as Friday, Mr Esper said that the Pentagon would “deliver by the end of this year a vaccine at scale to treat the American people and our partners abroad.”

A spokesperson later clarified that the end of the year was “a goal”, and experts believe that even if everything were to go perfectly, a 12 to 18-month timeline for a widespread rollout of a vaccine would be optimistic.

“Breaking: Michigan sends absentee ballots to 7.7 million people ahead of Primaries and the General Election,” Trump tweeted. “This was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State. I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!”

Both Michigan and Nevada are considered potential swing states in the November election.

The president followed up with a tweet tagging Russ Vought, the acting director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget; Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows; and the U.S. Treasury Department.

Trump’s threat to halt funding was issued hours after floods forced the evacuation of about 10,000 people in central Michigan. He didn’t specify what kinds of federal aid he would stop, or cite a legal basis for the action.

The president is scheduled to visit a Ford ventilator-assembly plant in Ypsilanti, Mich., on Thursday.

On Tuesday, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson announced a plan to send applications for absentee ballots to all registered voters in the state ahead of its elections in August and November.

There have been more than 50,000 confirmed coronavirus cases reported in Michigan to date, and more than 5,000 deaths.

“By mailing applications, we have ensured that no Michigander has to choose between their health and their right to vote,” Benson said in a statement. “Voting by mail is easy, convenient, safe and secure, and every voter in Michigan has the right to do it.”

Under normal circumstances, it is up to voters to request an absentee ballot, which are restricted to those voters who are traveling or temporarily residing away from their usual residence. About a third of the states require a specific reason to vote by mail. More than half allow voters to request mail-in ballots without one.

Benson quickly responded to Trump on Twitter.

Hi! 👋🏼 I also have a name, it’s Jocelyn Benson. And we sent applications, not ballots. Just like my GOP colleagues in Iowa, Georgia, Nebraska and West Virginia. https://t.co/kBsu4nHvOy — Jocelyn Benson (@JocelynBenson) May 20, 2020

The president made the same threat against Nevada, again raising without evidence the specter of voter fraud.

“State of Nevada ‘thinks’ that they can send out illegal vote by mail ballots, creating a great Voter Fraud scenario for the State and the U.S.,” Trump tweeted. “They can’t! If they do, ‘I think’ I can hold up funds to the State. Sorry, but you must not cheat in elections.”

Nevada has made its June 9 state primaries an all-mail election, sending absentee ballots to registered voters. According to Reuters, the state official responsible for elections is a Republican.

There is no evidence that voting by absentee ballot leads to more voter fraud. Trump himself voted by absentee ballot in the Florida primary in March. Yet he continues to rail against the practice.

During a coronavirus briefing at the White House last month, Trump said he was opposed to mail-in ballots because “people cheat.”

“No, mail ballots, they cheat,” he said. “OK, people cheat. Mail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country because they are cheaters.”

At a press conference Wednesday afternoon, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was asked about Trump’s tweeted threat against the state’s contingency plans.

“For 10 weeks we have been in the midst of battling COVID-19,” Whitmer said. “The people of this great state have done their part and we have seen our numbers flatten. We're not out of the woods yet. But it's taken a lot of sacrifice and it has not been easy.

“On top of this 100-year event, we have a 500-year event in a flood that has absolutely devastated a lot of families, a lot of communities,” she continued. “To see Twitter this morning, to see rhetoric like that is disheartening because I think it first shows you that there maybe was a lack of understanding of what the secretary of state was doing. She said we're going to mail applications, not ballots.”",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

""They were ecstatic because it was a success story.""

Carroll had more reason to celebrate, not just because he was returning to good health, but because those 12 days were full of some pretty upsetting visions. Per the Chronicle:

While in the coma, Carroll said he had dreams of visiting the afterlife. He saw himself leave his body and plummet down to hell, where Satan—a woman in his case—punished him for the deadly sin of sloth, morphing him into a Jabba the Hutt-like-monster who vomited blood until he had a heart attack. ""I woke up on the hospital bed with tubes coming in and out of me, and there was a nurse right there and my first words were, 'Am I still in hell?'"" Carroll said. ""She ignored me.""

It takes a very professional nurse to take a patient rambling about hell in stride. In Carroll's case though, the experience has him reevaluating some things. ""I’m still going to listen to satanic metal, and I still love Deicide and bands like that,"" he told the Chronicle. ""As far as for my personal life and my experience of what I went through, I don’t think Satan’s quite as cool as I used to.""

News,2020-05-19,['Korin Miller'],CDC: Coronavirus mainly spreads through person-to-person contact and 'does not spread easily' on contaminated surfaces,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5jHw3xaMl47LTHxNYnmtzg--~B/aD0xMzg5O3c9MjE1OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-05/2b5caf80-99e0-11ea-99cf-fc82c394babd,"The CDC has updated guidelines on coronavirus' spread, saying that it's ""not likely"" to spread through surfaces.

Even before COVID-19 officially had a name, public health officials said the virus could be transmitted through infected respiratory droplets and by touching infected surfaces and then touching your nose, mouth, and possibly your eyes. So, people began snatching up face masks, wearing gloves, and ramping up hand hygiene to try to protect themselves.

While touching infected surfaces has always been part of the messaging on how the virus spreads, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently shifted its stance online. The CDC now says that COVID-19 spreads from person to person contact, and then lists touching infected surfaces under a section titled, ""The virus does not spread easily in other ways."" The CDC adds: “This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about this virus.” The language is a subtle change from the organization’s warning in early March, when it wrote simply that it “may be possible” to spread the virus through contaminated surfaces.

The CDC, which did not respond to Yahoo Life’s request for comment, still recommends that you wash your hands often with soap and water, and routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces to protect yourself and others from the virus.

The CDC’s lesser emphasis on infected surfaces as part of the spread of COVID-19 is slightly different from that of the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO states online that “COVID-19 spreads primarily from person to person,” but adds that, “it can also spread if you touch contaminated objects and surfaces.” The WHO even breaks down for readers all of the commonly-touched surfaces to be wary of, like doorknobs, computers, elevator buttons, and pens, noting that “If you touch something contaminated and then touch your face… you might fall ill.”

So what does this mean, exactly?

Dr. Richard Watkins, an infectious disease physician in Akron, Ohio, and a professor of internal medicine at the Northeast Ohio Medical University, tells Yahoo Life that it’s important to keep in mind that COVID-19 is a new virus. “We are still learning about this new coronavirus —including how it spreads — and knowledge is increasing daily,” he says. With that, some guidance and information on the virus may change over time, he says.

There has been no new, major study to suggest that contaminated surfaces are less important in the spread of COVID-19, but epidemiological data (which is the method used to find the causes of health outcomes and diseases in populations) has simply found that person-to-person contact is more important, infectious disease expert Dr. Amesh A. Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, tells Yahoo Life.

“Based on the epidemiology, we know that the main way this virus is infecting people is from direct contact with other infected people,” Adalja says. “Contaminated surfaces play some role, but it’s likely much smaller.” It also makes sense, too, he says: “This is a respiratory virus, and respiratory viruses largely spread through breathing in infected respiratory droplets.”

Concerns about contracting the virus from infected surfaces mostly stemmed from a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in mid-March. That study found that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can last on a variety of surfaces for anywhere from four hours (copper) to three days (plastic and stainless steel). What the study didn’t find was whether people could actually become infected from touching those surfaces. But, since the study’s release, people have been nervous about handling mail, groceries, and other high-touch surfaces like doorknobs.

But the CDC’s shift in guidance doesn’t mean you should stop being cautious with those things, Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, tells Yahoo Life. “If I had to pick the things to pick an emphasis on to reduce the spread of COVID-19, it would still be social distancing, wearing masks, and practicing good hand hygiene,” he says. Schaffner compares the spread of COVID-19 to roadways. “Person-to-person contact is a highway, and the inanimate environment is a byway. Touching infected surfaces are little paths, but they don’t carry the big viral traffic,” he says.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

The model explores various scenarios under which states reopen, include continuing lockdowns, and a partial reopening. The model also forecasts those scenarios if social distancing rules continue to be adhered to or are relaxed.

For the PWBM forecast, the model considers that states reopen on May 18. All totals are cumulative, and include past positive cases and deaths.

If states fully reopen with no social distancing rules in place, as many as 5.4 million people could test positive for coronavirus. And if states reopen while still practicing measures of social distancing, nearly 4.3 million people are projected to be diagnosed with COVID-19 by the third week of July.

Partially reopening the states with social distancing rules in place would result in nearly 3.2 million positive cases.

The forecast represents a large uptick in positive cases in the United States which currently stands at 1.5 million, according to the Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker.

And according to the PWBM, the number of deaths would also start to rise as states reopen.

While previous forecasts from the University of Pennsylvania model had projected a death toll as high as 350,000, the new numbers are lower, though still higher than other models.

Even with states under a full lockdown, the model has projected a death toll at just over 156,000, a slight increase from its previous forecasts of 117,000.

The current death toll in the United States stands at nearly 91,000, according to Johns Hopkins.

But while this scenario is grim, it only serves as the baseline as more and more states reopen and others mull when and how to let business and other normal activities resume.

With a partial reopening, the model forecasts, the death toll will rise to 173,000 people. A full reopening would result in 231,000 deaths. If all the states reopened without adhering to social distancing guidance, that number leaps to 293,000.

While these numbers are large, they represent a revision downward from Wharton’s previous forecast of 350,000. They are also much larger than other models.

According to the University of Washington Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) model, the current projected death toll stands at roughly 144,000 by Aug. 4.

While the forecasts seem to warn against a full reopening of states, the model does project positive data economically if states reopen.

Keeping states in lockdown with full social distancing in place will cause U.S. GDP to shrink by 10.8% year over year by July 24, but reopening states would save the U.S. from the severe economic losses.

Towards the end of July the model forecasts, if states reopen GDP would decline by 7.7% compared to the year prior. And if social distancing is reduced, GDP would decline by 6.6%.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

By Julie Steenhuysen

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Two studies in monkeys published on Wednesday offer some of the first scientific evidence that surviving COVID-19 may result in immunity from reinfection, a positive sign that vaccines under development may succeed, U.S. researchers said on Wednesday.

Although scientists have assumed that antibodies produced in response to the new coronavirus virus are protective, there has been scant scientifically rigorous evidence to back that up.

In one of the new studies, researchers infected nine monkeys with COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus. After they recovered, the team exposed them to the virus again and the animals did not get sick.

The findings suggest that they ""do develop natural immunity that protects against re-exposure,"" said Dr. Dan Barouch, a researcher at the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Harvard's Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center in Boston, whose studies were published in the journal Science.

""It's very good news,"" Barouch said.

Several research teams have released papers - many of them not reviewed by other scientists - suggesting that a vaccine against the virus would be effective in animals.

In the second study, Barouch and colleagues tested 25 monkeys with six prototype vaccines to see if antibodies produced in response were protective.

They then exposed these monkeys and 10 control animals to SARS-CoV-2, the official name of the novel coronavirus.

All of the control animals showed high degrees of virus in their noses and lungs, but in the vaccinated animals, ""we saw a substantial degree of protection,"" Barouch said. Eight of the vaccinated animals were completely protected.

These studies, which have been peer reviewed, do not prove that humans develop immunity or how long it might last, but they are reassuring.

""These data will be seen as a welcome scientific advance,"" Barouch said.

At least 40,000 people could die with coronavirus in South Africa by the end of the year, scientists have warned.

The projections were made by a group of academics and health experts advising the government.

They assume tough lockdown restrictions will be eased from June, as President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced.

The curbs - which were introduced in March and include a ban on tobacco and alcohol sales - have been credited with slowing the spread of the virus.

The country of 57 million people has recorded just 17,200 cases of Covid-19 and 312 deaths linked to the disease so far. Spain, by comparison, has reported about 278,000 cases and almost 28,000 deaths for a population of only 47 million.

But the projections by the South African Covid-19 Modelling Consortium - set up to help government planning over the outbreak - says the country could experience a sharp rise in cases and deaths over the coming months.

The report was released during a meeting with Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize following criticism of the government's perceived lack of transparency.

The predictions are subject to change as more data becomes available, and assume the current restrictions will be relaxed from 1 June.

Under an ""optimistic scenario"", by late August the number of active cases could reach almost 100,000, before declining. The cumulative number of deaths by November would be 40,000.

Under a ""pessimistic scenario"" the number of active cases could peak around at 120,000 in August, and a total of 45,000 would die by November.

The report also suggests there could be 1.2 million Covid-19 cases in total, and intensive care units could be overwhelmed within weeks.

South Africa's balancing act

By Nomsa Maseko, BBC News, Johannesburg

The politics of Covid-19 and scientific rivalry have intensified in South Africa. The opposition Democratic Alliance is taking the government to court, arguing that the stringent lockdown regulations are unwarranted and the ban on alcohol and tobacco sales should be lifted.

The government itself is not speaking with one voice. This month President Cyril Ramaphosa said lockdown regulations would be eased from ""level 4"" to ""level 3"" to allow schools to reopen and more people to return to work from early June.

But Health Minister Zweli Mkhize seems reluctant, and has said that according to the World Health Organization, South Africa is not yet ready for level 3 because infections continue to rise every day.

It's a balancing act for the government, which has to take the issues of food security, job losses and the economy into consideration. Some scientists have called on the government to fast-track lockdown restrictions to level 2, claiming the current ones have little or no effect on the spread of coronavirus.

In March, President Ramaphosa imposed some of the strictest lockdown measures of any country.

Most workers were ordered to stay at home. In addition to the tobacco and alcohol bans, jogging, cycling and dog-walking were also prohibited.

On 1 May, the curbs were eased from ""level 5"" to ""level 4"", allowing people to exercise between 06:00 and 09:00.

People are still urged to wear face masks in public and observe social distancing rules.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

Over 4.9 million people across the globe have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new respiratory virus, according to data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. The actual numbers are believed to be much higher due to testing shortages, many unreported cases and suspicions that some governments are hiding the scope of their nations' outbreaks.

Since the first cases were detected in China in December, the United States has become the worst-affected country, with more than 1.5 million diagnosed cases and at least 92,645 deaths.

Last week, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announced a citywide campaign to test the entire population of 11 million residents for COVID-19 in an effort to search for asymptomatic carriers of the virus, after a cluster of new cases emerged for the first time since the city had lifted its strict lockdown on April 8. The number of nucleic acid tests conducted in the city daily has rapidly increased since then.

Although recommended, participation in the testing campaign is voluntary. Residents who were previously tested do not need to take part. It is not recommended to test children under the age of 6, according to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission's website.

7:43 a.m.: Dutch officials say mink may have infected human with COVID-19

Dutch investigators believe a human may have contracted the novel coronavirus from a mink at a farm in the Netherlands.

New research findings in the ongoing investigation into the country's mink farms also show that the animals can have COVID-19 without showing any symptoms, according to a press release from the Dutch government.

Investigators also believe cats may have a role in the spread of the virus on the mink farms. Coronavirus antibodies were detected in three out of 11 cats at one of the mink farms under investigation. Pending further research, the Dutch government is advising mink farm owners to ensure that cats cannot enter or exit the site.

The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic threatens Africa's progress, although the vast continent seems to be relatively spared from the scourge of the virus so far.

There have been less than 3,000 deaths from COVID-19 out of some 88,000 cases of the disease reported throughout Africa. That could be, in part, due to the fact that many countries across the continent took swift action in imposing preventative measures to stem the spread of the virus.

""As of now, reported cases are lower than feared,"" Guterres said in a video message Wednesday, while warning that ""much hangs in the balance"" and the pandemic ""will aggravate long-standing inequalities and heighten hunger, malnutrition and vulnerability to disease.""

The U.N. chief called for ""international action to strengthen Africa's health systems, maintain food supplies, avoid a financial crisis, support education, protect jobs, keep households and businesses afloat, and cushion the continent against lost income and export earnings."" He said the continent needs more than $200 billion and ""an across-the-board debt standstill for African countries"" to help address the devastating economic and social fallout of the crisis.

""Already, demand for Africa's commodities, tourism and remittances are declining,"" Guterres said, adding that ""the opening of the trade zone has been pushed back.""

5:41 a.m.: University of Cambridge to keep all lectures online until summer 2021

The prestigious University of Cambridge plans to keep all lectures online over the course of the next academic year due to the coronavirus pandemic.

""The University is constantly adapting to changing advice as it emerges during this pandemic,"" a spokesperson told ABC News in a statement Wednesday. ""Given that it is likely that social distancing will continue to be required, the University has decided there will be no face-to-face lectures during the next academic year.""

It's the first globally-known university to announce such plans beyond the upcoming fall term.

""Lectures will continue to be made available online and it may be possible to host smaller teaching groups in person, as long as this conforms to social distancing requirements,"" the spokesperson added. ""This decision has been taken now to facilitate planning, but as ever, will be reviewed should there be changes to official advice on coronavirus.""

The University of Cambridge, one of the oldest universities in the world, closed its campuses in the United Kingdom in March due to the pandemic. All teaching has been moved online and exams are conducted virtually.

4:19 a.m.: All 50 US states have now eased coronavirus restrictions

All 50 U.S. states have now taken steps to ease restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Connecticut was among the last to begin reopening its society and economy, with residents allowed to go to retail shops and dine outdoors at restaurants starting Wednesday. Hair salons and barbershops, however, won't be allowed to reopen until June 1, while guidance on gyms, nail salons, massage therapy businesses and tattoo parlors will come at a later date.

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont called it a ""slow and methodical reopening.""

""There is a balance and there's nothing that is risk-free,"" Lamont said at a virtual press conference Tuesday. ""I think we can proceed on a very thoughtful basis with those businesses that are least likely to be dangerous and most likely to have a real economic value for the state. And I'm looking forward, I think this is a good day for the state and I hope everybody maintains their discipline because that's going to make it successful.""

The process hasn't been without controversy. Earlier this month, protesters gathered outside the Connecticut state capital and the governor's mansion in Hartford demanding that businesses be allowed to resume activities, as a growing number of other states across the country began reopening.

Connecticut, home to some 3.5 million people, has so far tested more than 185,000 people for COVID-19 and at least 38,430 have returned positive results.

At least 3,472 people in the state have died from the disease, while another 914 remained hospitalized Tuesday.

""These are trend lines that I think give us some confidence,"" Lamont said. ""The timing is right, and we hit the key metrics that we thought we would.""

A top data researcher in Florida who developed the state's COVID-19 dashboard was fired on May 5.

The researcher, Rebekah Jones, told a local CBS affiliate that she had refused to ""manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.""

White House officials have praised the dashboard's accessibility, Florida Today reported.

Rebekah Jones, a top data researcher in Florida who developed the state's coronavirus dashboard, says she was fired because she refused to meddle with data related to COVID-19 cases in the state.

Jones, who was fired on May 5 from the state's health department, said in an email to WPEC, a local CBS affiliate, on Monday that her removal was ""not voluntary"" and happened because she refused to ""manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.""

In early May, Florida counties began reopening from the state's monthlong lockdown. On Monday, the state entered its first phase of reopening, as gyms, stores, grooming services, and restaurants were allowed to operate at 50% capacity.

White House officials have praised the dashboard's accessibility, according to Florida Today. Researchers and other news outlets have also used the site.

Rebekah Jones, who headed the team that created Florida's COVID-19 dashboard, was fired earlier this month. More

Florida Department of Health

For the past few weeks, though, the site has crashed and been periodically unavailable, Florida Today reported on Monday. Some data has gone missing, and access to underlying data has become a challenge, it added.

In an email to other researchers announcing her departure and seen by Florida Today, Jones said her office was no longer involved in publishing the data, fixing errors, or answering questions.

""As a word of caution, I would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency that I made central to the process during the first two months,"" she wrote in the email. ""After all, my commitment to both is largely (arguably entirely) the reason I am no longer managing it.""

The Florida Department of Health didn't immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

In a statement to The Miami Herald, though, DeSantis' communications director, Helen Aguirre Ferré, said, that it was a ""repeated course of insubordination"" that lead to her firing.

The office claimed she made unilateral decisions to modify the Department's COVID-19 dashboard without input or approval from the epidemiological team or her supervisors.

""The blatant disrespect for the professionals who were working around the clock to provide the important information for the COVID-19 website was harmful to the team,"" the statement said. ""Accuracy and transparency are always indispensable, especially during an unprecedented public health emergency such as COVID-19. Having someone disruptive cannot be tolerated during this public pandemic, which led the department to determine that it was best to terminate her employment.""

WASHINGTON — The 2020 election is setting up a legal battle of historic proportions over voting rights, said the top Democratic attorney in the thick of the fight.

“There’s been more voting rights litigation this election cycle already than there was in all of 2016, by a lot,” said Marc Elias, a D.C.-based lawyer with a long history in the political trenches.

“There may be more voting rights litigation in 2020 already than there was in 2016 and 2012 combined. It is on an order of magnitude,” Elias said in an interview on “The Long Game,” a Yahoo News podcast. And the situation is being exacerbated by the coronavirus outbreak, which could require an unprecedented increase in mail-in voting this November.

Elias, who was the top campaign lawyer for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, said he currently has 32 active lawsuits in 16 states, with about three-quarters of those suits having been filed since last November.

Republicans are not sitting idly by either. The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee have budgeted $20 million for court fights over voting rights.

“Marc Elias isn’t some knight fighting for voting rights. He’s trying to maximize Democrat votes, and that means opening up our elections to opportunities for fraud,” Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for President Trump’s reelection campaign, told Yahoo News.

Trump talks often about voter fraud, despite the lack of documented evidence of significant voter fraud in modern elections.

“Fraud by voters at the polls is vanishingly rare and does not happen on a scale even close to that necessary to ‘rig’ an election,” according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan voting rights group at New York University.

Elias said a massive legal brawl in 2020 has been brewing for several years thanks to three factors.

First, the 2013 Supreme Court decision in Shelby vs. Holder found that states no longer needed to seek Justice Department approval for major changes to voting procedures. The 1965 Voting Rights Act had instituted “pre-clearance” for a number of Southern states with a history of race-based voting discrimination.

But Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the 5-4 majority opinion in Shelby that pre-clearance was based on outdated criteria, and that if Congress wanted to reinstitute it, lawmakers “must identify those jurisdictions to be singled out on a basis that makes sense in light of current conditions.”

The Shelby decision, Elias said, “sent a broader cultural signal to Republican legislatures to pass more restrictive voting rules.” That development was a big reason why 2020 was already full of legal battles over voting laws before the coronavirus emerged.

After Democrats took control of the House in the 2018 election, they spent much of 2019 holding hearings in a special committee to establish a record of “current conditions” that they said constituted modern-day voter suppression, usually in states controlled by Republicans, and against minority voters who tend to overwhelmingly support Democrats.

Second, in 2018, restrictions were lifted that had for 35 years prevented the RNC from implementing “ballot security” measures. Questionable tactics by the RNC toward minority voters sustained the limitations for many years, but a federal judge allowed them to expire. Now the RNC has said it plans to recruit up to 50,000 volunteers to look for voters they deem to be suspicious at polling places in the fall elections, and to challenge ballots if need be.

Third, Elias said that Trump’s rhetoric has made Republicans “much more comfortable being in a position of opposing voting rights.”

Coronavirus, Elias said, is “adding gasoline on top of a fire.”",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

Rebekah Jones, who designed and managed the state’s COVID-19 dashboard, told CBS News 12 in West Palm Beach that her departure earlier this month was “not voluntary” and that she was removed from her position because she was ordered to censor some data. She said she refused to “manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.”

In an email to her colleagues alerting them to her departure two weeks ago, Jones wrote, “As a word of caution, I would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency that I made central to the process during the first two months. After all, my commitment to both is largely (arguably entirely) the reason I am no longer managing it.”

Jones served as the geographic information system manager for the Florida Department of Health’s Division of Disease Control and Health Protection. The dashboard had been previously praised by White House coronavirus adviser Dr. Deborah Birx. The state’s governor, Ron DeSantis, is a Republican and close ally of President Trump who initially hesitated to fully shut down the state and has pushed for reopening.

“The Florida COVID-19 Dashboard was created by the Geographic Information System (GIS) team in the Division of Disease Control and Health Protection at the Florida Department of Health,” DeSantis spokesperson Helen Aguirre Ferré told the Miami Herald in a statement. “Although Rebekah Jones is no longer involved, the GIS team continues to manage and update the Dashboard providing accurate and important information that is publicly accessible.”

In an email to the news site Florida Today on Tuesday, Jones said, “I worked on it alone, sixteen hours a day for two months, most of which I was never paid for, and now that this has happened I’ll probably never get paid for,” confirming that she had not just been reassigned on May 5, but fired.

Last week the state of Georgia fixed a graph showing COVID-19 cases after intense online mockery and criticism. The original graph was not arranged chronologically along the X axis, but instead to order the data in a way that made it look like it was declining.

Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican and close ally of Trump, has been on the forefront of pushing to reopen. His office apologized for the bungled data representation. It was the latest mishap by the state, which has struggled to accurately relay data about the disease.

Among the most promising, yet also controversial: new smartphone applications that perform contact tracing, currently under construction by private companies and government agencies.

The idea of sharing information about our lives with strangers or the government has, understandably, raised significant fears about surveillance and privacy. (The editorial board at the journal Nature recently called for “a cast-iron commitment from governments that the information being harvested is secure and will only ever be used for the reasons it is being requested.”)

Martin-dm/Getty Images More

Knowing how smartphone-based contact tracing apps work, however, and how they can exchange information without revealing our identities, will enable us to embrace this potentially life-saving technology— and make sure we hold app providers accountable for our right to privacy.

Contact tracing is exactly what it sounds like: After someone is diagnosed with a contagious disease, a trained public health worker interviews that person, then takes steps to identify and reach out to all those who came in contact with the infected individual. This approach is time-consuming and error prone; identifying all possible contacts depends on records and memory, and individuals may be likely to overlook unmemorable encounters (such as standing in line at the grocery store, passing someone on the sidewalk, etc.).

Today’s smartphones however, can supplement manual contact tracing with applications that notify you if you’ve been near someone with a positive diagnosis.

GPS-based tracking: Most smartphones already have highly accurate location-tracking capabilities in the form of GPS, or Global Positioning System. Digital contact-tracing apps that rely on GPS (like those being used in places like Norway, Hong Kong and even South Dakota) can create second-by-second records of our precise location, to within 16 feet. Your GPS record is compared to those of infected individuals to see if you, quite literally, crossed paths during an infected individual’s contagious period. While these location-based apps may prove effective in identifying physical contacts, this detailed and specific physical location data is not something anyone ought to feel comfortable releasing to others.

Bluetooth systems: For this reason, various companies and government agencies around the world are racing to build new contact-tracing apps that rely instead on your smartphone’s Bluetooth radio, with several already available in Australia and the U.K., and more emerging every day.

Bluetooth technology, which is also readily available on most smartphones, has two distinct technical functions: advertising and listening. When Bluetooth is “advertising,” your phone emits short, digital “chirps” (called beacons) that can be received by other Bluetooth devices that are “listening” nearby. In everyday uses, these inaudible chirps allow personal devices to discover each other. Your earbuds and smartwatch get connected this way, and your phone becomes a hands-free device after it hears the chirps emitted by your car. Most often, your phone is a listener: It receives chirps from other devices and, after connecting, can receive information (like a podcast or a record of your workout).",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

Or, if not now, then “prior to the end of the year,” as he said at the White House on Friday, which Moncef Slaoui, the drug company executive the president tapped to head the effort, called a “very credible” timetable. By historical standards, it is an extraordinarily ambitious goal. Some vaccines have taken a decade or longer to develop, test and manufacture. The most optimistic time by which a coronavirus vaccine might be ready, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the leading infectious disease specialist on the president’s coronavirus task force, is 12 to 18 months.

Underscoring his sense of urgency, Trump has compared the vaccine effort to the Manhattan Project to develop an atom bomb during World War II, and dubbed it “Operation Warp Speed.”

Warp speed is an invented term for travel faster than light, which is possible only in the fictional universe of “Star Trek.” Whether it will work for the creating a vaccine for a lethal disease remains to be seen. But there are a few hundred, possibly thousands, of people now in their 60s who are living reminders of the unintended consequences of putting a drug into people’s bodies without adequate testing.

Genetic engineering greatly speeds the process of developing a vaccine. But public health experts are still sorting through how to test it for safety and efficacy. The primary measure of safety, of course, is that a new vaccine doesn’t make people sick, which is easy enough to verify, although it would need to be tried in a large and diverse population to catch possibly rare side effects.

Efficacy is more complicated: Researchers can detect if people inoculated with the vaccine produce antibodies to the coronavirus, but how do they know if they are actually immune from future infection. One way, obviously, is to just watch them and see if they get sick (technically, if they get sick less often, or less severely, than an unvaccinated control group). But that’s a slow process. The other way, which is gaining support among researchers, is a “challenge trial,” in which volunteers receive an inoculation and then are exposed to an infectious dose of the virus — which clearly poses risks of its own. Challenge trials are usually done for diseases that are not as lethal as the coronavirus, or for which other therapies exist.

Quoted in The Hill, Jeffrey Kahn, director of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics, said he did not see how an institutional review board that oversees research would approve a human challenge trial for the coronavirus.

But Operation Warp Speed is proceeding along numerous tracks simultaneously: the genetic engineering of potential vaccines, testing in animals, trials in humans, and ramping up the production of the syringes, vials and other equipment necessary for mass inoculation. On Friday, Trump said “we’re gearing up” to begin manufacturing vaccines even before one (or more) is approved, so that there will be a stock on hand in advance. “That means they’d better come up with a good vaccine,” he said. “It’s risky, it’s expensive,” but it could cut a year off the time that might otherwise be required to put a vaccine into distribution.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

A 20-year veteran of the company described to Yahoo News her experience of returning to work on May 11 after taking a COVID-19 test four days prior. She hadn’t received the results by the time she arrived for her first day. Her temperature was taken on the way in, but she only gave verbal confirmation that she was not infected.

The worker, who asked not to be identified because employees at the plant were told to refrain from speaking to the media, was given two moveable plastic sheets on poles to provide a barrier between her and the workers next to her, and new protective equipment, including a face shield and a mask, which made the already grueling work even harder.

“The face shield is s***,” she told Yahoo News. “It fogs up and drips down my face.”

The Smithfield plant, one of 14 meat-processing facilities to reopen after outbreaks spread among the workforces, is under intense oversight from the CDC.

As COVID-19 ravages meatpacking plants throughout the country, beef and pork options are dwindling in grocery stores. Consumers are beginning to realize just how much of their meat consumption depends on a flawlessly executed assembly line of some 2,000 workers and a supply chain vulnerable to disruptions. Now, new internal reports from the government warn that some parts of the country may see meat shortages by the end of the month.

“Analysts suggest that meat supply chain disruptions could see 20 percent higher prices than last year and potential spot shortages of meat in certain markets by the end of May,” says an internal government senior leadership briefing slide dated May 12, and reviewed by Yahoo News.

The briefing, marked for official use only, was produced by the Departments of Homeland Security, Health and Human Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

A separate DHS document, dated May 13, says that while there won’t be general food shortages in the U.S., the country is likely to face shortfalls in some areas. “COVID-19 probably will reduce the variety of food available in the United States as certain food processing facilities close for days or weeks to mitigate COVID-19 spread,” the document says. “The food and agriculture workforce is especially vulnerable to contracting COVID-19 due to close working quarters and a lack of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).”

While some consumers are already being caught by surprise as the site of empty meat shelves at the grocery store, the government has had multiple warnings. For over a month, DHS, HHS and FEMA reports warned of breakdowns in the supply chain, ranging from outbreaks of infection among meat-processing workers, to shortages of chemicals and equipment needed at those facilities, according to more than a dozen daily updates reviewed by Yahoo News.

DHS, HSS and FEMA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Those warnings came after an internal government briefing from the beginning of April, previously reported by Yahoo News, predicted possible food shortages, including for meat.

Since that time, at least a dozen meat plants owned by meat giants Tyson Foods, Smithfield Foods, Cargill, USA Holdings and JBS have paused operations, though only two are still closed as of May 14.

The document, a May 13 daily interagency update on the nation’s coronavirus response circulated by the Department of Homeland Security, notes new areas of concern for coronavirus. It was provided to Yahoo News by one of its recipients under the condition that that recipient not be identified.

“As most states have begun phased re-opening, several COVID-19 hot spots continue to emerge,” the notice says. Three counties are then listed: Palm Beach; San Bernardino County, Calif.; and Marshall County, Ala.

“Palm Beach County, FL reported a 71% increase in new cases the last 7 days compared to the previous 7 days,” the document explains. “The state authorized Palm Beach County to begin Phase 1 of reopening on 11 May, which includes the reopening of barbershops, salons, restaurants, and other businesses.”

President Trump recently changed his primary residence from Manhattan to his Mar-a-Lago golf resort, which is located in Palm Beach County.

The information in the document is attributed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and was collected on May 12, which means cases were rising even before the county began to reopen on May 11. Other parts of the state had begun to reopen earlier, on May 4.

Neither FEMA nor the DHS responded immediately to a request for comment.

The DHS document says that San Bernardino County in California “reported an increase of 782 cases in the last 7 days, nearly doubling new cases reported in the previous 7 days. County officials recently began Phase II of the county’s reopening plan, lifting requirements for mask use on 8 May.”

Marshall County, Ala., the document says, “reported 217 cases in the last 7 days, a 517% increase over the previous 7 days. Marshall County is home to several poultry plants and the meat packing industry accounts for 8% of the county’s employment. On 11 May, additional businesses were reopened.”

Public health officials have warned that lifting stay-at-home orders would lead to more infections and, inevitably, more deaths. Some governors have either discounted or dismissed such warnings, as has President Trump.

Encompassing the beachfront and inland communities north of Miami, Palm Beach County has a population density about four times that of Marshall County, which is in the northeastern corner of Alabama, and seven times that of San Bernardino County, which encompasses the desert region east of Los Angeles. Population density is thought to contribute to the spread of the coronavirus, which causes the lung disease known as COVID-19. That disease has killed more than 87,000 Americans, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

The coronavirus also tends to strike older people. The average age of a Palm Beach County resident is 45 years old, whereas the average Marshall County resident is 39 years old and the San Bernardino County resident is only 33 years old.

Palm Beach is home to many retirement communities, a fact that worries health officials. The county has recorded 263 coronavirus deaths, three more than the entirety of South Korea, which recorded its first coronavirus case on the same late January day as the United States.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

Of course, the virus has not yet run its course, and while many governments are hoping that the worst is over, lifting restrictions too soon poses risks. With global economic losses expected to top $5.8 trillion, however, it’s no secret why world leaders are eager for their citizens to get back to work.

Here’s a sampling of how different nations are attempting to reboot.

Thanks to a feud with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro over whether to promote the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat the fast-growing number of COVID-19 cases there, Brazil’s top health official, Nelson Teich, resigned Friday. Bolsonaro, who, like President Trump, is a booster of the antimalarial drug that has shown poor results treating COVID-19 in clinical trials, had fired Teich’s predecessor less than a month ago amid a debate over whether Brazil should institute social distancing practices.

While Bolsonaro, like Trump, is urging citizens to return to normal life, Brazil is now recording more than 800 deaths per day, the New York Times reported. Only the United States has a higher daily number. Overall, more than 200,000 people have tested positive for COVID-19 in Brazil, and more than 14,000 have died from it.

On Thursday, Prime Minister Janez Jansa declared that Slovenia “has tamed the epidemic” and has the “best epidemiologic picture in Europe.” In the last 14 days, Slovenia reported just 35 new cases of COVID-19. Overall, 1,460 people have tested positive for the virus and just 103 have died from it.

On Monday, some schools will reopen. International travel, as well as public transit, will resume. But the government will also continue to follow a routine of testing, contact tracing and isolation in order to make sure the virus doesn’t mount a resurgence.

Unlike its European neighbors, Sweden never issued mandatory shelter-in-place orders for its citizens to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Social distancing was voluntary for its 10.2 million residents, and businesses and elementary and middle schools have largely remained open as the pandemic worked its way north from Italy and Spain.

While the government did ban public gatherings of more than 50 people, restricted bar service and forced high schools and universities to switch to online learning, the goal was to achieve herd immunity from the virus, which would necessitate at least 60 percent of the population catching it.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

Such a vaccine would inoculate people against the coronavirus, making a return to ordinary life possible. But given the clinical trials and logistical challenges of inoculating more than 300 million people, not to mention the rest of the world, most experts do not believe a mass vaccination program will take place for another 18 months.

There are numerous vaccines in various stages of development and testing, but approval for any of them will likely take several months at least.

But the drug industry executive Trump tapped as a co-director of the effort, while acknowledging that deploying a vaccine by the end of the year was an aggressive schedule, called it a “credible objective.”

Standing behind Trump was Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus task force. Testifying before the Senate earlier in the week, Fauci said that even once a vaccine has been developed, there was “no guarantee that the vaccine is actually going to be effective” when deployed in the general population.

Trump said the project would be “big” and “fast,” and likened it to the Manhattan Project, which led to the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. He suggested that a vaccine could begin to be available to the public by the end of this year.

Fauci has previously said that it was “doable” to have a vaccine by January. But others are skeptical of Trump’s timeline. “I don’t see a path by which any vaccine is licensed — whether it’s emergency use or otherwise — until the third quarter of 2021,” Dr. Peter Hotez, a Baylor College of Medicine epidemiologist who is working on a vaccine of his own, told CNN shortly after Trump made his remarks. “I just don’t see how you collect enough safety and efficacy data to say that we can have a vaccine for general use by the end of the year.”

Trump provided few details about the new initiative, though he did announce that it would be headed by Moncef Slaoui, a pharmaceutical executive, and Gustave Perna, commanding general of United States Army Materiel Command. (Slaoui will oversee the medical research, and Perna will supervise the logistics of manufacturing and distribution.) Details of the project had emerged in recent days, suggesting the kind of public-private partnership that Trump has endorsed in other aspects of the coronavirus response. Some two dozen private U.S. companies are now working on a coronavirus vaccine, as is the U.S. military.

Trump was at pains to say that regardless of when a vaccine was developed, the nation was already returning to normal. “I want to make one thing clear: Vaccine or no vaccine, we’re back,” the president said. He has previously described himself as the nation’s premier cheerleader, arguing that optimism was necessary at a time of crisis.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

Set to enter her junior year at the University of California, Davis, where she is earning a double major in community and regional development and Spanish, Larman returned to her parents’ home in nearby Albany, Calif., in mid-March, when Gavin Newsom became the nation’s first governor to issue shelter-in-place restrictions that put an end to in-person instruction.

Larman and nearly 40,000 of her classmates continued their education on Zoom, an online platform few had ever heard of before and that teachers and students alike have found to be a disorienting, two-dimensional substitute.

“I feel like I’m definitely not learning as much in my classes and I’m not having a very good time,” Larman told Yahoo News. “I really thrive off of being on campus. Seeing all of my friends in my classes really keeps me engaged. I like going to the coffee shop on campus and walking around. I like that routine.”

While Larman says that “the school did a really good job considering the crazy circumstances,” Zoom instruction isn’t what she bargained for, and she’s considering taking a leave of absence rather than return for another quarter of online offerings.

“I’m not sure if it’s worth around $5,000 a quarter [the cost of tuition only, excluding room and board] to attend a Zoom university,” Larman said.

She’s not alone. Dozens of students and their parents have filed lawsuits against colleges and universities this spring seeking tuition reimbursement. But the question of value is even more pressing looking ahead. Last week, California State University announced it would hold most of its classes next year online thanks to the coronavirus. That means 500,000 students will have to decide, in Larman’s words, whether “to attend a Zoom university.” If polling on this question is accurate, that could prove ruinous for higher education. A recent survey conducted by the American Council on Education found that nearly 20 percent of students currently enrolled in college are either unsure they will continue in the fall or say they will definitely not do so.

And the academic disruption caused by the pandemic has sparked a debate about the future of higher education in America.

“Nobody knows what the retention rates are going to be in the fall,” Roblin Meeks, associate dean of graduate studies at Manhattan’s John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told Yahoo News. “I think everybody is in a holding pattern. If Congress appropriates money for the states, then it won’t be as bad. It’s hard to know how much money the campuses are going to have to work with.”

John Jay, with 13,000 undergraduate and 2,000 graduate students, is part of the City University of New York, which receives approximately 60 percent of its funding from the state.

“There’s no school in the CUNY system that has a large endowment,” Meeks said. “Everyone is tuition-driven, so if a bunch of your students don’t show up, that’s really bad.”

It’s unclear when restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the coronavirus, which hit New York harder than any other city in the world, will be lifted. While the president of the well-endowed Ivy League Brown University, Christina Paxson, foresees implementing rigorous coronavirus testing, contact-tracing cellphone apps and new social distancing policies in order to lure students back to campus, for colleges in the CUNY system like John Jay, making that transition is harder to envision.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

The sailors who ""previously tested COVID positive and met rigorous recovery criteria have retested positive,"" a U.S. Pacific Fleet spokesperson said in a statement. The sailors are now off the ship and are required to isolate for at least 14 days.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Experts said the perplexing test results don't necessarily establish that a person can become infected twice — the positive results following negative tests may be a quirk related to the type of test that was used.

Nearly all of the diagnostic tests for COVID-19 in the U.S. look for snippets of the virus' RNA, or genetic code. (Another type of diagnostic test, called an antigen test, looks for proteins from the virus.)

But according to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""detection of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present."" In other words, the test may be picking up a piece of the viral RNA that's been left behind, rather than a fully intact, infectious virus particle.

A second positive test after a negative result may mean the virus is simply taking its time leaving the body, doctors said, and is no longer able to infect others.

""It's possible that people could shed remnants of the virus for some period of time. That doesn't mean anything is wrong with them or that they are contagious,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.

A study from South Korea bolsters that idea. Researchers at the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed data on 285 COVID-19 patients who also tested positive after having appeared to recover.

Scientists were unable to find evidence that the patients remained infectious. And viral samples taken from the patients couldn't be prompted to grow and thrive in lab studies, suggesting that the samples were duds.

""What we're finding more and more is that the fragments of virus that are being picked up on these swabs weeks later are not able to replicate,"" said Dr. Ania Wajnberg, associate director of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. ""They're not live virus.""

Still, the world has known about COVID-19 only for mere months, giving scientists no indication yet of how the virus acts long term.

""We just don't have enough details yet to make confident statements about immunology,"" said Dr. John Sanders, chief of infectious diseases at Wake Forest Baptist Health in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

Sanders said the different diagnostic results might also be explained by false negatives. ""I think that there is a lot to be learned about the testing and about the protective impact of having been infected or having developed an antibody,"" he said.

Sanders and a team of researchers at Wake Forest have embarked on an ambitious study to get a feel for how the virus acts in people, how long symptoms last and how COVID-19 might lead to immunity from secondary infections, at least for a certain period of time.

The group has enrolled 15,000 volunteers, some of whom have had COVID-19 and others who haven't. Each day, the volunteers are asked to record any possible symptoms they're experiencing. If a person reports any kind of symptom, such as fever or a cough, researchers ask for more information.

""We will send them a home test collection kit to send back to us. We'll test them to see if they have the virus and then continue to track them for antibodies after that,"" Sanders said.

The research team will upload the results into a database, tracking symptoms in real time. Ideally, public health officials could then compare the information with electronic health records. Sanders said the project aims to tease out whether an uptick in cough, for example, correlates with a true rise in COVID-19 or simply with allergy season.

The research group plans to conduct antibody testing on 10,000 of the volunteers six times over the next year. So far, all of the volunteers are from health systems in North Carolina, but researchers are working to expand the study along the East Coast.

""We have dozens of unanswered research questions about whether or not an antibody protects you against future infection, about whether or not you get complications after a COVID infection,"" Sanders said.

""This also allows us to collect the information necessary to start answering those more detailed questions.""

It seems these months of quarantine-life and a growing list of COVID-19 symptoms are leading many to think back to that stubborn cold from back in February or that sudden stomach bug that hit in March and wonder if it really was the coronavirus.

Call it “I-think-I-had-it-itis.""

But a hospital study in New York City has found that out of hundreds of New Yorkers who thought they potentially had COVID-19 in the last three months but never received a confirmed clinical diagnosis, only 37% tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, a sign the body was previously likely infected and fought the virus.

“That does imply that likely many of the people who suspect that they had this probably didn't have it,” said Dr. Ania Wajnberg, one of the authors of the Mount Sinai study and an associate professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine. “You can't assume that you had it just because you didn't feel well a few months ago.”

In comparison, 99% of New Yorkers tested by Mount Sinai who had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis did have antibodies, the cornerstone of the body’s immune response to a virus, the researchers reported.

Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor, said he, too, had a bit of ""I-think-I-had-it-itis.""

""As someone who actually was convinced that they had been infected and then tested negative, it’s clear that many of us have been in the same boat,"" he said. ""What we need to remember is that COVID-19 was circulating at the same time as a number of respiratory viruses likely creating confusion on the origin of infection.""

Brownstein said the new data suggests that the U.S. could be ""a ways off [from] herd immunity and further demonstrates the need of testing capacity.""

The findings were among the first to come out of Mount Sinai’s monumental antibody testing program, which is now performing over 3,000 tests a day, tallying over 25,000 people so far. The study, which was published earlier this month and has not been peer-reviewed, looked at the initial 1,343 people tested in the program, including those who had previously confirmed coronavirus infections and those who suspected, or were told by their doctors, that they likely did but were not tested.

The broader aim of the antibody program is to identify donors for convalescent plasma, an experimental treatment sometimes used for seriously ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

“We've given convalescent plasma to hundreds of patients at the Mount Sinai health system, and that's been a good thing to be part of,” Wajnberg said. “And it's also helping us learn about potential immunity.”

MORE: What can a COVID-19 antibody test tell us?

Researchers at Mount Sinai were among the first in the U.S. to develop an antibody test and received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration in April. There are currently 13 such tests with EUA in the U.S.

This week, Mount Sinai announced it is beginning to commercially produce its antibody test with a goal of testing more than 10 million patients per month by July.

Antibody tests are distinct from what are called diagnostic coronavirus tests, which look for live virus currently infecting the body. The Mount Sinai study said the results suggest ""the optimal time frame for widespread antibody testing is at least three to four weeks after symptom onset and at least two weeks after symptom resolution.""

In order to understand the long-term effects of severe Covid-19 infection, U.S. researchers have reviewed symptoms in people affected by other forms of coronavirus, notably SARS and MERS.

The meta-analysis of 65 peer reviewed studies and seven pre-prints on the observed psychiatric consequences of more than 3,550 severe infections with SARS (2002), MERS (2012) and Covid-19. The study was limited to cases treated in hospital and therefore does not apply to patients who experienced milder symptoms or were asymptomatic.

The results of the analysis, published in The Lancet Psychiatry suggest that whereas most patients will not suffer immediate mental health effects, certain complications like depression, anxiety, fatigue, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) could emerge in the months and years that follow hospitalization.

Two studies that systematically assessed common symptoms in a panel of 129 patients hospitalized with SARS and MERS noted various mental disorders such as confusion (28%), low mood (32%), anxiety (35%), impaired memory (34%) and insomnia (42%).

Twelve studies of patients with Covid-19 painted a similar picture with evidence of delirium in 26 out of 40 intensive-care patients, agitation in 40 out of 58 intensive-care patients, and altered consciousness in 17 out of 82 patients who subsequently died.

Six other studies of patients with SARS and MERS also found frequent reports of low mood (11%), insomnia (12%), anxiety (12%), irritability (13%), memory impairment (19%), fatigue (19%), and frequent recall of traumatic memories (30%) over a follow-up period ranging from 6 weeks to 39 months.

""While there is little evidence to suggest that common mental illnesses beyond short-term delirium are a feature of COVID-19 infection, clinicians should monitor for the possibility that common mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, fatigue, and PTSD could arise in the weeks and months following recovery from severe infection, as has been seen with SARS and MERS"", points out Dr. Jonathan Rogers, a researcher from University College London, UK, and a co-author of the study.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

Scientists, journalists and politicians were quick to criticize the president, pointing out the drug's ineffectiveness against the coronavirus in a few recent studies and long list of potentially dangerous side effects.

Multiple government agencies have warned against the improper use of hydroxychloroquine outside a hospital or clinical trial setting, yet the president has been touting the drug since early April often relying on anecdotal evidence for his arguments.

""You'd be surprised about how many people are taking it, especially the frontline workers, before you catch it,"" Trump said.

So what have we learned about hydroxychloroquine since it was first mentioned during the pandemic weeks ago? Here's everything you need to know.

What is hydroxychloroquine? What is it used for?

Hydroxychloroquine is an arthritis medicine that can also be used as a prevention or treatment of malaria, a red blood cell infection transmitted by a mosquito bite, according to the Mayo Clinic. It’s available in the U.S. under prescription only.

In addition to malaria, the drug can also be used to treat acute and chronic rheumatoid arthritis, discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus.

The Johns Hopkins Lupus Center said it can help control lupus by decreasing the immune system’s activity without predisposing it to infection. It can also protect against UV light and sometimes even improve skin lesions that don't respond to ointments.

Hydroxychloroquine can be administered either as a pill or by intravenous drip and is marketed under the brand name Plaquenil.

What are the side effects of taking it?

Another reason why experts are cautious about using hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 is because of its numerous side effects.

""It may also be worth noting that there are over 40 side effects associated with hydroxychloroquine dosage. These include dry cough, hoarseness, fever, difficulty breathing and increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmia,"" said John Scott, chair of the department of pharmacology at the University of Washington School of Medicine.

The long list of common side effects of Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) include nausea, vomiting, stomach pain or cramps, loss of appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, dizziness, spinning sensation, headache, ringing in your ears, nervousness, irritability, skin rash, itching or hair loss.

The Mayo Clinic urges patients to contact their doctor if they experience any serious side effects, such as muscle weakness, twitching, uncontrolled movement, loss of balance or coordination, blurred vision, light sensitivity, seeing halos around lights, pale skin, easy bruising or bleeding, confusion, unusual thoughts or behavior, or seizures.

Can hydroxychloroquine prevent or treat the coronavirus?

Two recent observational studies of COVID-19 patients suggested the drug has little impact in treating the disease. The studies, while not the same as a clinical trial, suggested that the drug did not significantly reduce complications from the virus or death.

A study posted on April 23 involving 368 patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 treated at Veterans Health Administration medical centers found there were more deaths among those given hydroxychloroquine than those receiving standard care. In addition, the drug made no difference in the need for ventilators.

The U.S. National Institutes of Health launched a large clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine given in conjunction with the antibiotic azithromycin last week. It is among multiple studies underway to see if the drug can help decrease hospitalization and death from coronavirus.

In a statement on the N.I.H. website about the study, Dr. Anthony Fauci noted that while where was anecdotal evidence that the drugs might benefit some people, ""we need solid data from a large randomized, controlled clinical trial to determine whether this experimental treatment is safe and can improve clinical outcomes.""",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

When will it be safe for children to return to the classroom?

That is the question being debated from the Oval Office to the dining room table, and the implications of doing so successfully will mark a significant turning point as societies look to emerge from the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Over the weekend, a senior public health official declared that emerging case studies of various open schools abroad suggest children seem “less capable of spreading” the virus -- a welcome sign for parents eager to regain some sense of normalcy.

“What we have seen in countries where schools have remained open is that there have not been big outbreaks in schools,” Soumya Swaminathan, the World Health Organization’s chief scientist, told the BBC on Sunday. “And where there have been it has been associated with events where a lot of people gather, not in regular classrooms. And it has often been associated with an adult who has had the infection and who spread it.""

But experts caution that while the emerging data is reassuring, it is simply too early to make any conclusive statements on whether or not children are less able to spread the virus relative to adults. The schools referenced by Swaminathan have all instituted social distancing and enhanced hygiene protocols that make virus spreading less likely.

A dearth of information about how the disease manifests in children makes reopening schools a potentially risky endeavor. Children may be just as likely to bring home the virus and should be taught to follow the same preventive measures to prevent the spread to others -- a particularly challenging feat since younger children are typically not as conscious of proper hygiene habits.

“It’s hard to make a definitive answer at this moment about children’s’ role in the transmission dynamic,” said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children’s Hospital and an ABC News contributor.

Experts agree that the virus affects children differently than it does adults. When children contract the virus, for example, they often show mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.

“The data suggests right now that children don’t get as sick as adults do,” Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor of pediatrics and infectious disease at Stanford University, told ABC News. “We aren’t seeing a lot of hospitalizations [with children], and the ones we are seeing seem to be distinct from what the adults are experiencing.”

In response to an inquiry about Swaminathan’s comments, the Center for Disease Control issued a brief statement to ABC News.

""Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 the same way as adults, and they can infect others if they have it,” the statement reads. “Like adults, children may be infected but not have symptoms, and there is increasing evidence that people without symptoms may also spread the disease.""

So where does that leave us on the question of transmissibility?

While children may be at lower risk of feeling symptoms of the disease, they still play a key role in mitigating its spread. As Brownstein said, “every kid is a bridge to a vulnerable person,” and traditionally, with respiratory viruses, children’s behavior lends itself to disease proliferation.

“Generally, children are important vectors in respiratory virus epidemics because of congregation, hygiene,” Brownstein said. “They’re in schools.”",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

Coronavirus school closures in all 50 states sent educators and parents scrambling to find online learning resources to keep kids busy and productive at home. Website traffic to the homepage for IXL, a popular tool that lets students practice skills across five subjects through online quizzes, spiked in March. Same for Matific, which gives students math practice tailored to their skill level, and Edgenuity, which develops online courses.

All three of these companies try to hook prospective users with claims on their websites about their products’ effectiveness. Matific boasts that its game-based activities are “proven to help increase results by 34 percent.” IXL says its program is “proven effective” and research “has shown over and over that IXL produces real results.” Edgenuity boasts that the first case study in its long list of “success stories” shows how 10th grade students using its program “demonstrated more than an eightfold increase in pass rates on state math tests.”

These descriptions of education technology research may comfort educators and parents looking for ways to mitigate the effects of lost learning time because of the coronavirus. But they are all misleading.

None of the studies behind IXL’s or Matific’s research claims was designed well enough to offer reliable evidence of their products’ effectiveness, according to a team of researchers at Johns Hopkins University who catalog effective educational programs. Edgenuity’s boast takes credit for substantial test score gains that preceded the use of its online classes.

Companies that provide online learning technology try to hook prospective users with claims about their products’ effectiveness. But, as in the case of IXL, which claims its program is “proven effective,” the studies behind the claims weren’t designed well enough to offer reliable evidence, university researchers said.

Misleading research claims are increasingly common in the world of ed tech. In 2002, federal education law began requiring schools to spend federal money only on research-based products. As more schools went online and demand for education software grew, more companies began designing and commissioning their own studies about their products. There is little accountability to make sure companies conduct quality research and describe it accurately, so they’ve been free to push the limits as they try to hook principals and administrators.

This problem has been exacerbated by the coronavirus as widespread school closures forced districts to turn to online learning. Many educators have been making quick decisions about what products to lean on as they try to provide remote learning options for students.

Coronavirus learning: Is online school program backed by Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg the answer?

A Hechinger Report review found dozens of companies promote their products’ effectiveness on their websites, in email pitches and in vendor brochures with little evidence or shoddy backing to support their claims. Some companies are trying to gain a foothold in a crowded market. Others sell some of the most widely used education software in schools.

Many companies claim that their products have “dramatic” and “proven” results. In some cases, they tout student growth that their own studies admit is not statistically significant. Others claim their studies found effects that independent evaluators say didn’t exist. Sometimes companies make hyperbolic claims of effectiveness based on a kernel of truth from one study, even though the results haven’t been reproduced consistently.

The Matific study that found a 34% increase in student achievement, for instance, includes a major caveat: “It is not possible to claim whether or how much the use of Matific influenced this outcome as students would be expected to show some growth when exposed to teaching, regardless of what resources are used.”

IXL’s research simply compares state test scores in schools where more than 70% of students use its program with state test scores in other schools. This analysis ignores other initiatives happening in those schools and the characteristics of the teachers and students that might influence performance.

About those teachers... They wanted respect. It only took a coronavirus pandemic and worldwide economic collapse

Edgenuity boasts of contributing to an eightfold increase in the rate of 10th graders' passing state math tests at Altamont High School in Utah. The claim is based on measuring growth starting two years before the school introduced Edgenuity, rather than just one year before. Over two years of actually using Edgenuity, 11th grade pass rates dropped in the featured school, ninth grade pass rates fell, then recovered, and 10th grade pass rates doubled – a significantly less impressive achievement than the one the company highlights.

Matific did not respond to repeated requests for comment. IXL declined to comment on critiques that its studies weren’t adequately designed to make conclusions about the impact of its program on student test scores. Edgenuity agreed it shouldn’t have calculated student growth the way it did and said it would edit its case study, though at the time of publication, the misleading data still topped its list of “success stories.”

More than $12 billion spent on education programs

When shoddy ed tech research leads educators to believe programs might really help their students, there are consequences for schools as well as taxpayers. Districts spent more than $12 billion on ed tech in 2019.

In some places, principals and administrators consider themselves well-equipped to assess research claims, ignore the bunk and choose promising products. But many people making the decisions are not trained in statistics or rigorous study design. They don’t have the skills to assess whether promising findings in one group of students may realistically translate to their own buildings. And, perhaps most importantly, they often don’t have the time or resources to conduct follow-up studies in their own classrooms to assess whether the products paid for with public money actually worked.

“We’re spending a ton of money,” said Kathryn Stack, who spent 27 years at the White House Office of Management and Budget and helped design grant programs that award money based on evidence of effectiveness. “There is a private-sector motive to market and falsely advertise benefits of technology, and it’s really critical that we have better information to make decisions on what our technology investments are.”

In 2006, Jefferson County Public Schools, a large Kentucky district that includes the city of Louisville, began using SuccessMaker. The Pearson product is designed to supplement reading and math instruction in kindergarten through eighth grade. From 2009 to 2014, records provided by the district show it spent about $4.7 million on new licenses and maintenance for SuccessMaker. (It was unable to provide records about its earlier purchases.)

Typically within the district, school principals get to pick the curriculum materials used in their buildings, but sometimes purchases happen at the district level if administrators find a promising product for the entire system.

SuccessMaker, which boasted on its webpage that it was “proven to work” and designed on “strong bases of both underlying and effectiveness research,” never lived up to that promise. In 2014, the district’s program evaluation department published a study on the reading program’s impact on student learning, as measured by standardized tests. The results were stark.

“When examining the data, there is a clear indication that SuccessMaker Reading is not improving student growth scores for students,” the evaluation said. “In fact, in most cases, there is a statistically significant negative impact when SuccessMaker Reading students are compared to the control group.”

The district stopped buying new licenses for the education software – but only after it had spent millions on a product that didn’t help student learning.

Students are ghosting teachers: Without in-person classes, many students have essentially gone missing, teachers say

Companies can grade their own software

That same school year, Pearson paid for a study of SuccessMaker Reading in kindergarten and first grade. The company said the study found positive effects that were statistically significant, a claim it continues to make on its website, along with this summary of the program: “SuccessMaker has over 50 years of measurable, statistically significant results. No other digital intervention program compares.”

An independent evaluator disagrees.

Robert Slavin, a Johns Hopkins professor, wanted to watchdog companies selling schools software to be purchased with federal money. The 2015 federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act, sets guidelines for three levels of evidence that qualify as purchases: strong, moderate and promising. Companies get to decide for themselves which label best describes their studies. A year after the law passed, Slavin started Evidence for ESSA.

“Obviously, companies are very eager to have their products be recognized as meeting ‘ESSA Strong,’ ” Slavin said, adding that his group is trying to fill a role he hopes the government will take on. “We’re doing this because if we weren’t, nobody would be doing it.”

Slavin’s organization tries to fill the gap by offering schools an independent assessment of the research that companies offer for their products.

When Slavin’s team reviewed SuccessMaker research, it found that well-designed studies of the education software found no significant positive outcomes.

Slavin said Pearson contested the Evidence for ESSA determination, but a follow-up review by his team returned the same result. “We’ve been back and forth and back and forth with this, but there really was no question,” Slavin said.

Pearson stands behind its findings. “Our conclusion that these intervention programs meet the strong evidence criteria … is based on gold-standard research studies – conducted by an independent third-party evaluator – that found both SuccessMaker Reading and Math produced statistically significant and positive effects on student outcomes,” the company said in a statement.

Though the law requires schools to spend federal money only on research-based products, there’s little accountability to ensure that companies such as Matific conduct quality research and describe it accurately in their marketing materials. More

SuccessMaker didn’t fare well when judged by another evaluator, the federally funded and operated What Works Clearinghouse.

Launched in 2002, the What Works Clearinghouse assesses the quality of research about education products and programs. It did a review of SuccessMaker Reading in 2009 and updated it in 2015. The conclusion: The only Pearson study of the program that met What Works’ threshold for research design showed the program has “no discernible effects” on fifth and seventh graders’ reading comprehension or fluency. (The Pearson study included positive findings for third graders that What Works did not evaluate.)

The Hechinger review of dozens of companies identified seven instances of companies giving themselves a better ESSA rating than Slavin’s site and four examples of companies claiming to have research-based evidence of their effectiveness when What Works said they did not. Two other companies tied their products to What Works’ high standards without noting that the organization had not endorsed their research.

Online school is hard enough: Now imagine you're still learning to speak English

'There isn't a ton of great evidence'

Despite almost 20 years of government attempts to focus on education research, “we’re still in a place where there isn’t a ton of great evidence about what works in education technology,"" said Stack, the former Office of Management and Budget employee. ""There’s more evidence of what doesn’t work.”

In fact, out of 10,654 studies included in the What Works Clearinghouse in mid-April, only 188 – less than 2% – concluded that a product had strong or moderate evidence of effectiveness.

Part of the problem is that good ed tech research is difficult to do and takes a lot of time in a quickly moving landscape. Companies need to convince districts to participate. Then they have to provide them with enough support to make sure a product is used correctly, but not so much that they unduly influence the final results. They must also find (and often pay) good researchers to conduct a study.

When results make a company’s product look good, there’s little incentive to question them, said Ryan Baker, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania. “A lot of these companies, it’s a matter of life or death if they get some evidence up on their page,” he said. “No one is trying to be deceitful. (They’re) all kind of out of their depth and all trying to do it cheaply and quickly.”

Many educators have begun to consider it their responsibility to dig deeper than the research claims companies make. In Kentucky's Jefferson County, administrators changed their approach to picking education software, in part because of pressure from state and federal agencies.

Felicia Cumings Smith, the assistant superintendent for academic services in Jefferson, joined the district two years ago after working in the state Department of Education and at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. (The Gates Foundation is one of the many funders of The Hechinger Report and is a partial funder of USA TODAY's education team.) Throughout her career, she has pushed school and district officials to be smart consumers in the market for education software and technologies. At Jefferson, she said things have changed since the district stopped using SuccessMaker. The current practice is to find products that have a proven track record of success in similar student populations.

“People were just selecting programs that didn’t match the children that were sitting in front of them or have any evidence that it would work for the children sitting in front of them,” Cumings Smith said.

Jefferson County, one of the 35 largest districts in the country, has an internal evaluation department to monitor the effectiveness of products it adopts. Many districts can’t afford that. Even in Jefferson, the programs that individual principals choose to bring into their schools get little follow-up evaluation.

A handful of organizations have begun to help schools conduct their own research. Project Evident, Results for America and the Proving Ground all support efforts by schools and districts to study the impact of a given product on their own students’ performance. The ASSISTments E-TRIALS project lets teachers perform independent studies in their classrooms. This practice helps educators better understand if products that seem to work elsewhere are working in their own schools. These efforts reach relatively few schools nationwide.

Sudden school closures have complicated the problem as educators rushed to find online options for students at home. “This is such a crisis that people are, quite understandably, throwing into the gap whatever they have available and feel comfortable using,” Slavin said.

Online testing has problems, too: Online AP exam issues prompt College Board to offer email option. It's too late for thousands of students who will have to test again.

Slavin sees an opportunity in the chaos. Educators can use the next several months to examine ed tech research and be ready to use proven strategies – whether they’re education software or not – when schools do reopen, making them savvier consumers.

“Students will catch up, and schools will have a taste of what proven programs can do for them,” he said. “At least, that is my hope.”

Apple and Google are rolling out their exposure notification API so that public health agencies can start including the technology in their apps.

22 countries have been given access to the API along with three US states, the companies said.

It's the first major phase of the technology. Apple and Google have spent weeks finessing the privacy elements of the app, as well as improving the level of control for public health agencies.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Apple and Google have started rolling out their COVID-19 contact tracing tech in a publicly available software update, meaning public health agencies can start building it into apps.

The arrival of the application programming interface (API) – which Apple and Google now officially call the exposure notifications system – means public health agencies can begin to roll out their own contact tracing apps to users.

The software will use Bluetooth to detect other smartphones in close proximity and alert the user – assuming they have a relevant health app installed – if they come into contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.

The companies said that 22 countries on five continents have received access to the API, along with three US states: Alabama, South Carolina, and North Dakota. More locations will get access in the coming weeks, Apple and Google said.

Spokespeople for Google and Apple said that in most cases the API will only be available to one app per country, but said exceptions could be made. However, this does not appear to be the case for the US, where individual states are creating their own apps.

Apple and Google consulted with several public health groups to finesse the API, including the CDC Foundation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Association of Public Health Laboratories.

Off the back of those talks, the API has been tweaked with several improvements for health agencies, including letting agencies themselves decide what constitutes ""an exposure event"" between people, and determine the level of risk from instances of someone coming into contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19.

The companies said they will continue to update and improve the API as they get feedback from public health authorities.

Earlier this month, Apple and Google gave us a preview of what the interface might look like on iPhones and Android smartphones. It also recently announced it had tightened some of the privacy controls around the tech, including encrypting the data that gets shared via Bluetooth.

But the bigger challenge will be for public health agencies to get people to download their apps. One study has suggested that 60% of the population would need to adopt these apps for the technology to be effective, but according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll, nearly three in five Americans said they would be unwilling or unable to use Google and Apple's contact tracing technology.

The UK is currently trialing its own NHS contract tracking app, which has been criticized by cybersecurity researchers who discovered several security risks.

However, it was recently reported that the NHS could be working on a separate app that uses Google and Apple's API.

Two weeks into the reopening of Texas, coronavirus cases continue to climb — along with tensions.

Shops, restaurants, nail salons, cinemas, barbershops, beaches, gyms, offices, childcare facilities, and personal care services are among the businesses that have reopened to the public.

Bars, wine tasting rooms, bowling alleys, skating rinks, and rodeo events will reopen on Friday so long as they stay under 25% of their maximum occupancy rate. Zoos can follow suit next Monday.

Professional sports leagues, including basketball, baseball, football, and tennis, can hold events from May 31, but fans are not allowed.

Regardless of the type of establishment, people are encouraged to maintain social distance, keep their faces covered, and wash or sanitize their hands frequently.

Two weeks after its stay-at-home order expired, Texas reported its highest single-day increase in coronavirus cases over the weekend.

But that's not stopping Gov. Greg Abbott from easing restrictions.

The Texas Department of State Health Services announced on Saturday that 1,801 new people had been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours. That surge was partially caused by an outbreak in the Panhandle, where more than 700 cases attributed to local meatpacking facilities were recorded in the city of Amarillo, the Houston Chronicle reported.

As of Wednesday, the statewide tally has risen to 50,564 patients and 1,388 deaths, based on data from Johns Hopkins University.

Texas is one of several states that are relaxing containment measures that states put in place in March. Shops, nail salons, movie theaters, barbershops, tanning salons, churches, and beaches are open to the public.

Restaurants have also been allowed to reopen and can, from Friday, go from 25% to 50% of their maximum capacity. People are encouraged to maintain social distance, wear face masks, and wash their hands frequently.

But two people were hospitalized and around 180 were arrested after a wild ""Go Topless Jeep Weekend"" on Crystal Beach in Bolivar Peninsula between May 15 and May 17. Footage from the scene show people drinking and partying but not much social distancing.

""We been in quarantine, and I need to get out and party,"" Chelsey Coyer told KBMT.

Cases in Texas are surging after the state started reopening

Abbott has defended the fast clip at which the state is resuming business, saying its death and hospitalization rates are lower than in other states of similar size, such as Florida and California, the Associated Press reported.

So far, Texas has conducted 723,013 coronavirus tests, which is about on par with Florida's total testing but much lower than California's 1.23 million tests, according to the COVID Tracking Project. That means only about 2.5% of Texas' 29 million residents have been tested.

Abbott said in a statement that he anticipates the number of new infections in Texas to rise as the state doubles down on testing ""most high-risk areas: nursing homes, meatpacking plants and jails.""

""That is exactly why I established Surge Response Teams,"" he added. ""By immediately deploying resources and supplies to these high risk areas, we will identify the positive cases, isolate the individuals and ensure any outbreak is quickly contained, which is the strategy being deployed in Amarillo.""

Abbott's goal is to open Texas fully.

Gyms, offices, and nonessential manufacturing facilities reopened on Monday, but social distancing is still required, and none of them can exceed 25% of their maximum capacity. At gyms, showers and locker areas will remain off-limits, equipment must be sanitized after each use, and gloves are mandatory.

The governor announced on Monday that childcare centers can resume operations effective immediately, alongside massage parlors, beauty salons, and other personal care services. Youth clubs, including the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, are allowed to hold meetings with no more than 10 members at a time, all of whom must remain 6 feet away from each other.

Abbott also gave bars, wine tasting rooms, bowling alleys, skating rinks, bingo halls, aquariums, and equestrian events the green light to reopen on Friday so long as they stay under 25% of their maximum occupancy rate. Zoos can follow suit on Monday.

In a 74-page decision, U.S. District Judge Fred Biery wrote that the coronavirus pandemic had left the world “without immunity and fearfully disabled.”

The decision came after the Texas Democratic Party and individual voters filed a suit last month arguing that the state’s denial of mail-in ballots during a pandemic was a violation of their constitutional rights.

Only people over the age of 65 and those with a disability that prevents them from voting in person are allowed to cast mail-in ballots in the state.

Echoing a false claim made by President Donald Trump last month, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, also a Republican, has argued that expanding mail voting would only “serve to facilitate fraud.”

“Mail ballots based on disability are specifically reserved for those who are legitimately ill and cannot vote in person without needing assistance or jeopardizing their health,” Paxton said after a district court ruling last month. “Fear of contracting COVID-19 does not amount to a sickness or physical condition as required by state law.”

But Biery rejected Paxton’s arguments, writing that the state raised the “specter” of widespread voter fraud but offered little evidence that such crimes are happening in states that allow more mail-in voting.

“The court finds the Grim Reaper’s scepter of pandemic of disease and death is far more serious than an unsupported fear of voter fraud,” he wrote.

Any eligible voter who wants to vote by mail to avoid contracting coronavirus can apply for a ballot in upcoming elections, Biery wrote.

Paxton said in a statement Tuesday that Biery’s decision “ignores the evidence and disregards well-established law.” His office plans to seek immediate review by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.

The decision comes amid a political battle over vote-by-mail during the pandemic. Democrats have largely supported expanding access to mail-in voting, with lawmakers urging party leaders to make it a priority. House Democrats included a provision in the latest coronavirus relief bill that would offer every American that option to vote by mail in the 2020 presidential contest.

Trump, who has voted by mail himself, said the bill was “DOA.”

“If you look at the bill that Nancy Pelosi is putting in, it has a lot to do with elections. We're not going to lose elections because of that,"" he said.",95,High,Left-center,USA,1

(Center for Pharmaceutical Research via The New York Times)

In a medical research project nearly unrivaled in its ambition and scope, volunteers worldwide are rolling up their sleeves to receive experimental vaccines against the coronavirus — only months after the virus was identified.

Companies like Inovio and Pfizer have begun early tests of candidates in people to determine whether their vaccines are safe. Researchers at the University of Oxford in England are testing vaccines in human subjects, too, and say they could have one ready for emergency use as soon as September.

Moderna on Monday announced encouraging results of a safety trial of its vaccine in eight volunteers. There were no published data, but the news alone sent hopes soaring.

Animal studies have raised expectations, too. Researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center on Wednesday published research showing that a prototype vaccine effectively protected monkeys from infection with the virus.

The findings will pave the way to the development of a human vaccine, said the investigators. They have already partnered with Janssen, a division of Johnson & Johnson.

In labs around the world, there is now cautious optimism that a coronavirus vaccine, and perhaps more than one, will be ready sometime next year.

Scientists are exploring not just one approach to creating the vaccine but at least four. So great is the urgency that they are combining trial phases and shortening a process that usually takes years, sometimes more than a decade.

The coronavirus itself has turned out to be clumsy prey, a stable pathogen unlikely to mutate significantly and dodge a vaccine.

“It’s an easier target, which is terrific news,” said Michael Farzan, a virologist at Scripps Research in Jupiter, Florida.

An effective vaccine will be crucial to ending the pandemic, which has sickened at least 4.7 million worldwide and killed at least 318,000. Widespread immunity would reopen the door to lives without social distancing and face masks.

“What people don’t realize is that normally vaccine development takes many years, sometimes decades,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, a virologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston who led the monkey trials. “And so trying to compress the whole vaccine process into 12 to 18 months is really unheard-of. If that happens, it will be the fastest vaccine development program ever in history.”

More than 100 research teams around the world are taking aim at the virus from multiple angles.

Moderna’s vaccine is based on a relatively new mRNA technology that delivers bits of the virus’s genes into human cells. The goal is for cells to begin making a viral protein that the immune system recognizes as foreign. The body builds defenses against that protein, priming itself to attack if the actual coronavirus invades.

Some vaccine-makers, including Inovio, are developing vaccines based on DNA variations of this approach.

But the technology used by both companies has never produced a vaccine approved for clinical use, let alone one that can be made in industrial quantities. Moderna was criticized for making rosy predictions, based on a handful of patients, without providing any scientific data.

Other research teams have turned to more traditional strategies.

Some scientists are using harmless viruses to deliver coronavirus genes into cells, forcing them to produce proteins that may teach the immune system to watch out for the coronavirus. CanSino Biologics, a company in China, has begun human testing of a coronavirus vaccine that relies on this approach, as has the University of Oxford team.

Other traditional approaches rely on fragments of a coronavirus protein to make a vaccine, while some use killed, or inactivated, versions of the whole coronavirus. In China, such vaccines have already entered human trials.

Florian Krammer, a virologist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, predicted that at least 20 additional vaccine candidates will make their way into clinical trials in the weeks to come.

“I’m not worried at all about it,” he said of the prospects for a new vaccine.

Many of these vaccines will stumble as the trials progress. As more people are inoculated, some candidates will fail to protect against the virus, and side effects will become more apparent.
