Krieger'],Coronavirus: Trump predicts vaccine delivery by end of 2020. Experts say that’s not likely,https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/browning2.jpeg?w=1024&h=683,"The Trump administration on Friday formally announced a hyper-ambitious plan to develop and manufacture hundreds of millions of doses of a COVID-19 vaccine that would be widely available by the end of this year.

The reason behind the plan’s optimism was unveiled on Monday morning: The leading candidate vaccine, developed by the drug maker Moderna in conjunction with the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center, appeared to generate an immune response in eight healthy volunteers.

Additionally, the product appeared to protect mice who were exposed to the virus.

The company plans to launch a large clinical trial in July aimed at showing whether the vaccine works. It is ramping up its capacity to manufacture the vaccine, it said Monday.

But it represents just the beginning of a long process to bring a vaccine to market. Vaccine studies require broad testing in thousands of patients followed over many months, and hope can fizzle out if there are new issues with safety or efficacy. And once proven, distribution must wait for factory construction, mass production of millions of doses and final federal approval.

What do other experts say about the timetable of a “game-changing” vaccine or drug that will let us return to normal life, enjoying parties, restaurants, music festivals, football games and graduations?

Many scientists say they doubt we’ll meet Trump’s goal of hundreds of millions of coronavirus vaccine doses by January. While we may have data showing that a candidate vaccine is effective by then, it will take longer to build the capacity for manufacturing and distribution of so many doses, experts say.

It’s possible, say some, that we’ll first have an effective drug or therapeutic antibodies to treat patients who are already infected with the COVID-19 virus. While such a treatment would not end the pandemic, it would blunt the impact.

Here is a collection of expert opinions we’ve gathered from the federal hearings, press briefings and university academic webinars:

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director, National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID):

“If we are successful” with the NIAID-Moderna vaccine, “we hope to know that in the late fall and early winter (of 2020).

“Even at the top speed we’re going, we don’t see a vaccine playing in the ability of individuals to get back to school this term.”

“Will we know it’s effective? I think extremely unlikely for the span of a year to 18 months. And given other technical problems in producing vaccines, that may even take a lot longer.

“We’ll have hints of all the things that it should do probably by the end of the year (2020) for the front runners, and middle of next year (2021) for some of the followers.”

Over the weekend, and without an official announcement, the state began to partially reopen lots at 27 state parks and beaches in Santa Cruz, San Benito, Sonoma, Riverside and Orange counties, along with the Lake Tahoe Area, and several other mostly rural parts of the state.

In most of the re-opened parking lots, 50% or fewer of the parking spaces will be available.

California has 280 state parks. As of Monday, 36 were closed and 244 were open. State parks officials have closed the parking lots in the parks that are open as a way to encourage only local visitors and reduce crowd size.

Gloria Sandoval, deputy director of California’s state parks department, said Monday that the state was able to reopen some lots starting Friday after consultation with local and state health officials. She said that the department expects visitors not to travel across county lines, and to go only to their local parks, as a way to reduce overcrowding until conditions continue to improve and more rules can be relaxed.

“We are still telling people to stay close to home,” she said. “It’s important for everybody to do their part to help mitigate the spread of the virus.”

Sandoval recommended that anyone planning to visit a state park first look up the website for that individual park to see the latest rules at www.parks.ca.gov. All beaches in Santa Cruz County, for example, are closed daily between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m., by local order, with violators subject to $1,000 fines — although swimming and surfing are permitted.

Guided tours, campgrounds, museums and visitor centers remain closed at all state parks, although trails are open at many.

On Monday, as he relaxed some rules around California, Gov. Gavin Newsom was asked when he would be opening state parks parking lots, following reports that it was difficult for the elderly and disabled visitors to visit the ones that are open.

Alameda County added 65 new cases on Monday. That number was only four fewer than the number of new cases added in San Mateo County (69), which issued its first update since Saturday.

Overall, Alameda County has confirmed 2,457 cases of the coronavirus during the pandemic, and it has averaged 51 new cases a day over the past week. It was the fourth time in May that health officials there have confirmed at least 60 new cases in a day.

Oakland, which has confirmed 819 cases and is averaging 187 cases per 100,000 people, is the county’s biggest trouble spot. Hayward is another one, with 495 cases and 307 cases per 100,000 people.

On Monday, Santa Clara County added 19 new cases, bringing its total to 2,470, still the most in the 10-county region. San Francisco’s tally is up to 2,131 after officials there confirmed 40 more cases, and San Mateo County has a total of 1,671. Contra Costa County has tallied 1,155 cases after reporting an additional nine.

Those counties reported their new totals before 6 p.m. Monday and they are reflected through Sunday night.

None of those jurisdictions reported any new deaths, news that is particularly welcome in Alameda County. Health officials there have not reported any deaths for two straight days following a five-day stretch in which they reported at least one death a day and totaled 12.

Santa Clara County has recorded 135 deaths, Alameda County 83, San Mateo County 66, San Francisco 36 and Contra Costa County 33. Solano (16), Marin (14), Sonoma (4), Napa (3) and Santa Cruz (2) counties have combined to record another 39 deaths.

Santa Clara County San Mateo County and San Francisco have not added to their death totals for three straight days, and Contra Costa County hasn’t added a new death since Wednesday. There have been two deaths in the past week in San Francisco and 10 in San Mateo County, compared to six and five, respectively, the week prior.

Contra Costa County has added fewer than 10 cases in a day three times over the past week.

Health officials in Contra Costa County also reported that only 16 people were in the hospital with the coronavirus, equaling the fewest that have been there since only 15 were hospitalized on March 24. Over the past seven days, an average of 18 people per day have been in the hospital in Contra Costa County; on April 14, the seven-day average was 39.

Although more results are expected to be added, the initial 294 tests to come back Sunday in San Francisco showed the highest positive percentage in the city (9%) since April 22.

Hospitalizations in the city dropped even further entering the weekend. The number fell to a new low Friday, down 17% from the day before, which was already the lowest it had been since March 31. There was one more patient hospitalized Saturday, for 53 at last count, but two fewer in intensive care units. ICU patients are now at their lowest levels since the city began tracking the data at the end of March.

Of the 69 newly reported cases in San Mateo County, 47 came Saturday and nine Sunday, with the remainder attributed to tests taken before the weekend, according to the county’s dashboard.

Hospitalizations in San Mateo County had fallen to a new low late last week before rising back up slightly over the weekend. The 54 patients hospitalized there Saturday were 10 more than Thursday, but still lower than at anytime before the past week since the virus took hold.

Statewide, the number of cases topped 80,000 on Sunday, with just over 10,000 in the Bay Area. With all Bay Area jurisdictions modifying their local orders, only Los Angeles and Sacramento counties remain in Phase 1 of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s reopening plan.

After sticking with some of the strictest stay-at-home orders in California to curb the spread of coronavirus, the entire Bay Area is advancing in lockstep through the second phase of reopening the state by allowing curbside retail pickup to start on Friday.

The new directive, signed Monday by six public health officials in Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco and Santa Clara counties and the city of Berkeley, replaces one issued just two weeks ago that permitted construction and other outdoor businesses and activities to resume.

“COVID-19 and the measures we’ve taken to prevent the spread have profoundly disrupted the lives of every single member of our community,” Santa Clara County Health Officer Sara Cody said during a news conference on Monday. “However, our collective effort has significantly reduced the spread in our county, and we now have a little bit of headroom to cautiously take another step forward.”

The new local order, which marks the second loosening of the region’s mandate imposed in mid-March, falls largely in line with Gov. Gavin Newsom’s guidelines for reopening the state. It places the region’s 8 million residents firmly in the second of four phases in Newsom’s plan, and all Bay Area counties on the same page, after San Mateo and San Francisco counties issued similar guidance last week.

The Bay Area’s decision came within hours of Newsom’s refining the criteria for counties to plunge deeper into phase 2 of reopening, such as no more than a 5% weekly increase in hospitalizations and a positive COVID-19 test rate of less than 8% countywide.

Given the current indicators, the governor said 53 of the state’s 58 counties could start allowing a slew of business sectors to reopen, including in-store retail and hair salons, in several weeks.

“This is an important period of time,” Newsom said. “We’re moving into an important few weeks ahead of us, and we’re going to see a lot more activity. Let’s just make sure we do it thoughtfully and strategically.”

Spectator-free sporting events could even resume by the first week of June, with some caveats. And, Newsom said, the state is “within a few weeks of meaningful modifications” involving places of religious worship.

“We are working overtime with leaders in the community to come up with guidelines and restore that capacity,” he said.

[ FAQ: What does it mean to enter ‘Phase 2’? Which parts of the state qualify? ]

In the Bay Area, storefront and curbside retail pickup will be allowed to resume on Friday, along with the activities of associated manufacturing, logistics and warehousing businesses that support retail.

Under the regionwide order, stores are prohibited from moving their products outside for display or sale, and customers must order and pay for products online or over the phone. Businesses are permitted to operate only with one employee per 300 square feet unless the individuals are from the same household.

The new regulations only apply to retail stores with direct access to an adjacent sidewalk or outdoor pedestrian walkway, street or parking lot. Stores in an enclosed indoor shopping center or mall must remain closed.

Outdoor museums, historical sites and publicly accessible gardens also are permitted to open their doors to visitors. And drive-through celebrations, parades and graduations are permitted across the region, as long as people ride solely in cars with members of their household and do not leave their vehicles. That new guidance comes less than two weeks after Santa Clara County explicitly banned car parades.

Despite the governor’s announcement Monday, different areas in the state are permitted to move at their own pace. In the Bay Area, where stricter regulations have been in place since the very beginning of the pandemic, in-person dining and shopping will have to wait, as well as other higher-risk businesses, such as gyms and bars, and any gatherings outside a person’s immediate household.

Santa Clara County, which once accounted for the most cases in the state, now has just 3% of the cases and 4% of the deaths statewide, according to Cody, and with more than double the number of tests conducted in the county since the middle of March, the rate of positive tests has declined from 9% to 1.5%.

“We have flattened the curve here in Santa Clara County like nowhere else in the country, and its because of what everyone has done,” Cody said.

“We’re sort of picking off the menu that the state has offered as well as adding some additional local guardrails to keep our community safe,” Cody said. “We understand the urgency, but we don’t want to have to go backward.”

But even as the Bay Area takes another modest step toward reopening its devastated economy, some business owners aren’t celebrating just yet.

Outdoor gear store Stevens Creek Surplus has remained open during the stay-at-home order for curbside pickup because of the construction- and restaurant-related products available in the store. But without allowing customers to come into the store, assistant manager Mustafa Makati said it has been difficult to adapt to the logistical challenges of restricting the foot traffic the store typically relies on.

“A lot of customers are not happy because they want to come in and browse,” Makati said. “It’s not easy. It’s a lot of burden for two or three employees going back and forth, back and forth.”

As of Monday, Santa Clara County had confirmed 2,470 cases of COVID-19, Alameda County 2,457, San Francisco 2,131, San Mateo County 1,671 and Contra Costa County 1,155.

A photograph of a Humboldt County resident holding a sign that compares California’s ongoing stay-at-home order to the slave trade has exploded online to widespread reactions calling the sign racist and deeply offensive.

Gretha Stenger held the sign at a protest last week in front of the Humboldt County courthouse, where she was photographed for a post in Redheaded Blackbelt, the community news blog in Southern Humboldt.

In a statement on Monday, Stenger apologized for the image, which was shared thousands of times on Twitter and garnered hundreds of reactions on Facebook from people criticizing the sign’s message. Stenger said the sign was not hers but handed to her by another protester at the demonstration.

The image appears to depict Escrava Anastacia, an African slave venerated in Brazilian folklore.

Stenger, wearing a red scarf, is photographed holding a sign that depicts a black-and-white image of a young woman wearing a muzzle, with the accompanying message: “Muzzles are for dogs and slaves. I am a free human being.”

In past years, Stenger has directed plays for North Coast Preparatory Academy in Bayside, but the Humboldt County Office of Education said Monday she is not currently employed at the charter school.

Below is Stenger’s full statement, provided to the Times-Standard on Monday afternoon:

“Holding that sign up at the lockdown protest was a grave mistake and I ask forgiveness from all those who I have caused pain. As I had no sign of my own, it was handed to me by another protester and a photographer took the picture before I considered the racist implications. My intent was to take a stand for the freedom of all human persons and I mistakenly held a sign that conveyed the opposite. Please know that I respect the dignity of all people and I sincerely regret any suffering it has caused.”

Stenger did not directly address several of the Times-Standard’s questions about the ongoing stay-at-home order or the equivalencies drawn between that and slavery.

The protest, one of many regular demonstrations in front of the courthouse, featured sign-wielding residents demanding an end to California’s policies surrounding the coronavirus pandemic.

Among local policies is that residents should wear masks when they can’t stay six feet apart from each other, in order to slow the spread of the respiratory illness COVID-19.

Many of the tweets sharing and criticizing the image include Stenger’s name, which is identified in the photograph of her in Redheaded Blackbelt. Another woman photographed holding the sign has also been widely identified. The Times-Standard has not been able to reach the other woman for comment.

Sharrone Blanck, president of the local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People chapter, said Monday that Stenger should back up her apology with actions, instead of just words.

“The first issue is the fact that this person is equating dogs to enslaved people, specifically enslaved Africans,” Blanck said. “Then she identifies herself as a free human being — somehow above and better than people of African descent and people of color in general who were made to wear muzzles.”

Blanck criticized local news outlets consistently covering recent protests of the stay-at-home order and neglecting other local demonstrations, including a recent May Day rally, in which protesters adhered to social-distancing guidelines.

“The media really needs to look at why they cover some things and not other things, and do an analysis of whether or not they cover events with people of color instead of events that are predominantly white,” Blanck said.

Gavin Newsom rolled out his new coronavirus-decimated budget proposal this week, some affordable housing advocates expressed relief the damage wasn’t worse.

Staring down a $54 billion budget shortfall, Newsom on Thursday rolled back several ambitious plans he’d laid out just four months before to tackle the state’s homelessness and affordable housing crisis. But he didn’t gut everything — and what he did cut, he attempted to fill in using federal money.

“It was not as dire as was predicted by a lot of groups,” said David Garcia, policy director of the UC Berkeley Terner Center for Housing Innovation. “But there’s still a lot of changes to process.”

The brunt of the cuts will be shouldered by K12 schools, colleges and state employees, with state parks and prisons feeling the squeeze as well. But Newsom’s newly revised budget also eliminates the ambitious $750 million state fund for homeless housing and services he had proposed in January.

Instead, the governor intends to use $750 million in federal funds — which already have been allocated to the state — to buy the hotels and motels counties across California that are being used as temporary homeless housing during the pandemic. So far the state, in partnership with county governments, has leased more than 15,000 rooms as part of its Project Roomkey initiative — 7,200 of which are occupied. Buying those hotels and motels could allow counties to turn them into permanent housing, answering a question that has plagued homeless service providers for months: What happens to those residents once the pandemic ends?

“It’s terrific that the governor is signaling that the state is going to use a portion of its federal resources to make sure people stay housed,” said Matt Schwartz, president and CEO of the California Housing Partnership. “Is $750 million enough? No, it won’t be enough. We’re going to need more federal funding, and we’re going to need the state to double down on this amount if it wants to keep all 15,000 people housed.”

The governor also abandoned his earlier proposal to beef up Medi-Cal by $695 million, which would have provided for better treatment of mental illness among those experiencing homelessness. But if additional federal funds Newsom has asked for come through, that cut will be reversed.

Newsom said within the next few years, he hopes to be in a position again where he can jump-start the programs he was forced to cut this year.

“We’re not going to walk away from them,” he said.

In a bright spot for housing activists, Newsom’s revised budget retains key funds to finance affordable housing construction: $500 million in low-income housing tax credits. That will help make sure affordable housing continues to be built during what’s likely to be an upcoming recession, Garcia said.

“A lot of groups were concerned that that would not survive the revise,” he said. “So the fact that that is in there is a big relief for affordable housing builders.”

Assemblyman David Chiu, D-San Francisco, was pleased the revised budget kept the $500 million in low-income housing tax credits, but expressed frustration at the loss of funding to help cities combat homelessness.

“I am deeply concerned that we are shifting away from addressing our housing and homelessness crises, which affects all other aspects of life for everyday Californians,” he wrote in a statement. “Our housing crisis has made people poorer, sicker, and more vulnerable to COVID-19.

The gift drive was born in a community Whatsapp group; neighbors Anju Prakash and Sushil Shukla spread the idea after the Bay Area’s shelter-in-place order was extended from April through the end of May. The organizers had few limits for participating: No minimum amount was set for donations, nor were there any rules about the items that could be contributed.

Prakash said she first came up with the idea after seeing a waste collector’s audition on an episode of “American Idol.” The contestant then offered a tedious description of how he cleaned up after finishing his shift.

“This was pre-COVID time. It struck me that: Can you imagine what our garbage-truck and recycle and yard-debris workers are doing, taking all our garbage — probably with stuff that’s being infected by bacteria — and they have to take it away. Even if they use gloves and masks and they don’t have to touch it personally, they still go home to their families. I thought of them. I thought of the mailman,” Prakash said.

The neighbors then reached out to the waste collection company’s customer service department with their idea. Steve Viamari, general manager for Alameda County for Republic Services, suggested handing out gift certificates to local businesses that are struggling amid the shelter-in-place order.

“I’m absolutely floored by their generosity,” Viamari said, adding that the gifts are a morale booster in a tough time. “It’s a challenging job right now. Our employees are working hard every day to service our customers and the communities — and people are realizing we’re a vital part of that, and we appreciate the recognition for it.”

Workers have received gift cards to local eateries, including Ambrose Butchery, Aniki Sushi, Bill’s Café, Country Way, Din Ding Dumpling House, Dino Family Restaurant, El Patio, Falafel, Etc., La Casita, Massimo’s, Mi Lindo Sinaloa, Mission Pizza, Sala Thai, Satomi Sushi, Shakers Pizza, Skillets, Smoking Pig, Super Taco, The Port of Peri Peri and Zorba’s.

On Monday, the gift cards that Reyansh Awasthi handed one worker in an envelope totaled $25. Shukla, a software architect at Oracle, also presented the three collectors who met with the community donors with gifts from local Kohl’s, Ross and Uniqlo retail outlets.

“They come every day and they have to be out all the time. They have to deal with (trash) all the time. We wanted to appreciate all they are doing for us. That is why all of us are giving them some stuff,” Shukla said. “I think we are the ones doing it for the first time. Other communities will know about it, then these people will get more help.”

Republic Services has launched a $20 million “Committed to Serve” initiative during the COVID-19 pandemic. The effort is aimed at helping to “support our small-business customers that are the economic engines of local communities” while the company’s roughly 36,000 employees remain in the field and on-the-clock.

Guadalupe Davila, who has been picking up trash in the Heritage Heights neighborhood for more than 20 years, didn’t know who was behind the gifts and food the workers were receiving on Wednesdays and Fridays when the community drive started last month.

“I really respect this. I really appreciate what they are doing,” Davila said, adding that the increased kindness reflects the difficult times. “On holidays we get a lot of gifts, but with this pandemic, we really got a lot of things within the last few months.”",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

Former A’s manager Art Howe, who tested positive for COVID-19 on May 5 is out of the ICU and back home, according to Yahoo Sports.

Howe, 73, second to Tony La Russa with 600 wins in Oakland A’s history, will remain in isolation at home for a few weeks, The Washington Post reported.

“Relief, back in my own bedroom, it’s just sweet,” Howe said to reporters. “I’m finally feeling a little bit better. Still not able to eat real good, taste buds are giving me a hard time.

Howe said he has lost taste and smell.

“I know I should eat but nothing at all makes you want to eat,” he said to a Houston-area TV station.

During his hospitalization he received several get well wishes from players and reporters who still appreciate his genial nature.

Pitcher Tom Candiotti spent his only season with the A’s in 1998. Howe was his manager. Asked then about what kind of a guy Howe was, Candiotti said:

”He was my manager in 1985 winter ball, in Ponce, Puerto Rico. I went up to him and said, ‘Do you mind if I throw some knuckleballs?’ I hadn’t thrown it that much, and I wanted to work on it.”

”He said, ‘Have at it.’ The one thing you can take to the bank is Art’s patience,” Candiotti said, noting that managers flock to winter ball for the same reason players do — to get noticed. Allowing a pitcher to work on his knuckleball could have repercussions on a prospective manager. Howe didn’t blink.

“We want employees to be able to work where they feel most creative and productive,” Square said in an emailed statement. “Squares will be able to work from home permanently, even once offices begin to reopen.”

The move follows a similar policy announced last week by Twitter, the other San Francisco firm led by CEO Jack Dorsey. The social media company told workers they could do their jobs remotely “forever” if they wished and their positions allowed for it.

Shelter-in-place orders from the pandemic have led many Bay Area companies to consider extending work-from-home policies beyond the pandemic, and several have told this news organization they plan to continue allowing remote work after it’s safe to return to offices. Google earlier this month said it was extending its work-from-home policy to the end of the year from June. Facebook has said it plans to re-open offices July 6 but will let employees work from outside offices through the end of 2020.

Square said it didn’t have a timeline for opening offices, but that the bulk of its full-time employees would be able to work remotely after offices open. News of Square’s policy was first reported by tech website The Verge.

For Harris, 58, this is only the latest attempt for a release. For decades, he has been incarcerated in federal and state prison for various convictions related to a massive international cocaine trafficking he built in the 1980s, which at its peak generated an estimated $2 million per day. But unlike many in his situation, Harris has the backing not just of justice reform advocates, but law enforcement members and elected officials, who have lobbied for his freedom in recent years.

Harris is currently incarcerated in Federal Correctional Institution Lompoc, where his federal sentence is set to end in October 2028. It is a prison complex that has gained national notoriety for its failure to contain COVID-19; with more than 1,700 cases and 10 fatalities, the prison was recently sued by the ACLU over its handling of the pandemic.

According to court filings by Harris’ legal team, Harris is afflicted with Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a disease where the body’s immune system attacks the nerves, which can lead to full-blown paralysis. This, combined with the coronavirus outbreak, adds up to an “imminent threat” to Harris’ health if he is not released, his attorneys argued.

“If Mr. Harris were to become critically ill or die while in custody, it would be not only devastating from a human standpoint for Mr. Harris and his family, but would eliminate a person who, following his release, would in all probability serve as a great source of healing and mentoring in the disadvantaged community of South Central Los Angeles in which he was raised,” Harris’ attorneys, Matthew Lombard and Bruce Zucker, wrote in a motion for compassionate release.

On top of that, Harris’ motion argues that the U.S. Marshal service miscalculated Harris’ federal sentence when he was sentenced to federal and state terms in the early 90s, and that Harris would be a free man today if not for their mistake.

In its response, the U.S. Attorney’s office argues on technical legal terms that Harris should be ineligible for a judge-ordered compassionate release because he still has a pending administrative appeal for release. They also argue that staff at Lompoc have taken “aggressive” measures to reduce the further spread of COVID-19 in the facility, including testing the entire inmate population.

“None of (Harris’) arguments, including those related to COVID-19, justify a permanent, irrevocable reduction in his sentence,” assistant U.S. Attorneys with the Central District of California wrote in a response motion. They later added that, ” Many of the defendant’s allegations are based on his mischaracterization of the record and downplaying his material involvement in drug trafficking activities.”

It was unclear when a judge will rule on the motion. On Friday, U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter Jr. ordered Harris’ attorneys to file a 20-page reply to the federal government’s response by May 22, according to court records.

The coronavirus outbreak in the Lompoc prison complex — which comprises two federal prisons — is widely considered the worst of any federal jail or prison, nationwide. Its number of confirmed cases has grown exponentially, nearly doubling from May 11 to May 17, according to published reports.

At FCI Lompoc, where Harris stays, roughly 80 percent of the 1,162 inmates have tested positive for the virus. There have been 10 fatalities.

Late last week, the ACLU filed a class-action suit on behalf of Lompoc inmates, accusing the prison of “deliberate indifference” to stopping the spread of the virus. The Bureau of Prisons has not publicly responded to the suit.

Harris’ career and public persona

Harris is famous for financing the start of Death Row Records in the early 1990s, investing $1.5 million in a partnership with the label’s co-founder Marion “Suge” Knight. The two formed a parent company for Death Row Records known as Godfather Entertainment, but business disputes between Knight and Harris ultimately curbed the partnership. In the 1990s, Death Row Records produced numerous classic rap albums, including Snoop Doggy’s Doggystyle and 2pac’s best-selling record during his life, All Eyez on Me.

Harris also co-founded the Houston-based Rap-a-Lot Records, and funded the Broadway play Checkmates, starring Denzel Washington.

In the late 1980s, Harris was convicted of attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder in state court. He was also convicted in federal court of conspiring with members of the notorious Columbian-based Cali Cartel to distribute cocaine throughout the United States, earning a reputation as the king of Los Angeles’ cocaine rackets.

Over his decades in prison, though, Harris gained a different kind of notability; he formed the nonprofit Richmond Project, aimed at diverting youth in West Contra Costa away from crime. He became editor-in-chief of the San Quentin News and is credited with bringing the award-winning newspaper back from the brink.

“Being a drug dealer is what Michael Harris did, not who he is,” his attorneys wrote in the compassionate release motion, later adding: “During his time as a drug dealer, he has said, he had grown physically as a male, but he acted in immature boyish ways, to the detriment of himself, his family, and countless others. After more than three decades in prison, when he leaves, he will be a senior citizen, but also he will leave as a morally mature man.”

Harris has publicly apologized for the cocaine dealing of his past numerous times, and maintained his innocence in his state charges. His attorneys wrote that the purported victim of Harris’ conspiracy to commit murder conviction has since admitted his testimony was “perjured” and that Harris was innocent of his state charges. He was paroled from state prison in 2011, and immediately picked up by the U.S. Marshals and taken to Lompoc.

Harris has also gained the support of numerous public officials — including former Obama advisor Van Jones — as well as politicians like State Sen. Nancy Skinner, D-Berkeley, and Contra Costa Supervisor John Gioia. Former Richmond police Chief Chris Magnus even wrote a letter advocating for Harris to be released from prison, in which Magnus described Harris as a “rare and valuable” person whose influence was “badly needed” in the Richmond community.

Last August, a federal judge denied Harris’ appeal for an early release under early release under Amendment 782, an Obama-era law that changed sentencing guidelines for federal drug convictions. It was widely — and inaccurately — reported at the time that Harris had been granted his freedom.",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday the state is eyeing the first week of June for live pro sports events to be held. Two conditions: the current “trend lines” in the Covid-19 recovery must continue, and games will be played without spectators in attendance.

These plans were echoed by governors in New York and Texas.

“If our professional sports teams can make it work (& be safe) on their end, we’re supportive,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wrote on Twitter.

California could continue to implement a local approach to sports, as it has done in reopening other sectors. Newsom said the state was working with county health directors, state officials and representatives from all major sports leagues, as well as consulting with California’s pact of western-state governors.

“We’re just talking about the opportunity … to begin the process of organizing around what that may or may not look like,” Newsom said.

The three pro sports teams in Santa Clara County — the 49ers, the San Jose Sharks, and the San Jose Earthquakes — remain in limbo. The county with the strictest guideline in the state is expected to shelter-in-place for at least another two weeks.

The Bay Area’s major league baseball teams — the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics — would open their seasons around July 4 under a proposal that first must gain approval from the players’ union. Spring training, which was suspended about a week before Opening Day, would resume in mid-June, likely in Arizona.

Of course, nothing is certain.

“We’re holding off (comment) until we have a little more info on what this means for baseball,” a San Francisco Giants spokesperson said of Newsom’s green light for pro sports.

While the NBA has been exploring ways to complete its season — it came to an immediate halt March 11 when a Utah Jazz player tested positive for COVID-19 — several teams have begun conducting limited workouts at their facilities. The Warriors have not yet done that; they have 17 games remaining in a lost season, According to multiple reports, the league is considering resuming the season in a single site — such as Orlando, Florida or Las Vegas — to limit travel.

The 49ers hope to hold training camp at their Santa Clara facility in two months, a notion that suddenly isn’t nearly the longshot it was a week ago. Richard Sherman, the 49ers’ outspoken and Stanford-educated cornerback, took to Twitter to explain the state’s change in stance.

“Money changes everything,” Sherman wrote. “Teams started exploring options outside the state and all of a sudden the timeline changed.”

Money changes everything. Teams started exploring options outside the state and all of a sudden the timeline changed https://t.co/eeAIl8B4bg — Richard Sherman (@RSherman_25) May 18, 2020

The 49ers closed their stadium offices and training center in mid-March. The NFL is allowing clubs to reopen their facilities as early as Tuesday for up to 75 employees, while still prohibiting coaches and non-rehabilitating players. State and local governments must permit such openings and teams must meet the NFL’s revised health protocols.

The Sharks’ season remains on hold with the rest of the NHL. A restart would not necessarily assure the last-place Sharks (29-36-5) of playing out their remaining 12 games, including five at home, or joining any reconfigured playoff format.

“Any longer term return-to-play scenarios in our local facilities, whether for this season or next, will be based on the direction and guidance of local health officials,” said Scott Emmert, Sharks vice president of communications.

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, in a virtual town hall hosted last week by the Sharks, dismissed any notion the league will not be able to resume its season and award the Stanley Cup in the coming months. “States are re-opening, cities are re-opening,” Bettman said. “And if we do the right things, I think we’ll be able to finish the season.”",100,High,Left-center,USA,1

Kristof'],"Kristof: America’s true COVID-19 death toll already exceeds 100,000",https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/trump.jpg?w=1000&h=667,"Many supporters of President Donald Trump believe that the figures for coronavirus fatalities are inflated, and Trump himself shared a tweet doubting the accuracy of some virus figures.

He’s right that the death toll seems off — but not in the direction he would suggest. We’ve crunched the numbers, state by state, and it appears that somewhere around 100,000 to 110,000 Americans have already died as a result of the pandemic, rather than the 83,000 whose deaths have been attributed to the disease, COVID-19.

That’s my estimate reached with the help of a Harvard statistician, Rafael Irizarry, based on a comparison of death rates this spring with those in previous years. Some states have been largely unaffected — death rates in some even appear to have dropped, perhaps because of less driving and fewer car accidents — but others have seen huge surges in deaths.

Overall, in a bit more than two months, the United States lost more Americans to the coronavirus than died over seven decades in the Korean, Vietnam, Persian Gulf, Afghanistan and Iraq Wars.

Here’s how we reached our estimates; they are not definitive, for they are based on preliminary data, and I invite discussion.

The starting point is that the cause of death is often uncertain. Most people who die don’t get an autopsy, and many never had a coronavirus test. The precise number who died from COVID-19 is in some sense unknowable.

Still, one standard approach to measure the impact of a pandemic like this is to look at “excess deaths,” meaning mortality greater than the average for a particular time period.

For example, for the seven weeks ending April 25 in the United States, about 70,000 more Americans died than is normal for those weeks (death is seasonal and normally declines over the course of spring and summer). That 70,000 figure for excess deaths does not include Connecticut, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, which were excluded because of missing or dubious data.

The official number of COVID-19 deaths in that period for the rest of the country was 49,100. That suggests an undercount of more than 20,000 coronavirus-related deaths as of April 25.

Add those 20,000 missed deaths to today’s total of 83,000, and you already get more than 100,000 pandemic-related deaths. But the undercount probably continued after April 25, albeit at a lower rate.

We don’t have good enough mortality data to assess excess deaths in late April and early May, a period in which more than 30,000 Americans are reported to have died of COVID-19. Testing increased significantly, and over time, doctors seemed more willing to list COVID-19 as the cause of death.

“There’s probably less underreporting as time goes on,” notes Robert N. Anderson, the chief of mortality statistics at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. In New York City, a study likewise found enormous underreporting in the first half of April, then gradually diminishing by the beginning of May.

In the period we looked at, the undercount also diminished. Initially, there were more than twice as many excess deaths as reported coronavirus deaths, but by April 25 there were only 40% more. If the undercount thereafter were 10%, that would add a few thousand to the total, possibly bringing it closer to 110,000.

These numbers are uncertain, but the implication is that somewhere around 25,000 more Americans died as a result of the pandemic than are recorded in the death tallies.

This kind of analysis can’t determine if they died directly from the virus or indirectly. Some presumably perished from heart attacks or strokes because they feared going to hospitals and delayed calling 911, or because ambulance services were stretched thin. In other words, a modest number presumably died because of the virus without being infected by it.

One reason to think that a great majority of the excess deaths are directly caused by the virus is that in some states that seem to have meticulous reporting, such as Massachusetts, the number of excess deaths and the number of COVID-19 deaths are not so far apart.

Irizarry, who is also chairman of the department of data science at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, notes that our new estimates are built on several layers of uncertainty. It typically takes two months for deaths to be reported in a reasonably complete way, so one critical issue is how to adjust for lags in reporting. The CDC tries to estimate what the death total will eventually be based on incomplete reporting, and our estimates depend on its algorithms.

The mortality figures show enormous variation by state. Texas and California appear to have suffered more deaths from the 2018 flu epidemic than from the coronavirus so far. And according to the CDC numbers, some states, including Arkansas, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota and Rhode Island, actually experienced fewer deaths than normal in the seven weeks ending April 25. The reason might be a decline in driving and a drop in accidental deaths.

Irizarry calculates that about 70% of excess deaths nationally derive from just five states: New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts and Illinois.

The idea that official figures are undercounts is widely acknowledged. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci told a Senate health committee Tuesday that he didn’t know if the real death toll was 50% higher than the official figures, but that “almost certainly it’s higher.”

“Most frontline doctors will tell you that the numbers are grossly underreported,” said Michael P. Jones, an emergency medicine physician who works at hospitals in the Bronx that were particularly hard hit. Especially in the early days, he said, many COVID-19 deaths were simply listed as some variant of “respiratory failure” or “multisystem organ failure.”

Dr. Alicia Skarimbas, who practices in New Jersey, said, “We signed so many death certificates, we would get behind and take turns doing them.”

Skarimbas said that she would list COVID-19 as the cause of death when that seemed obvious, but her partners might simply list “respiratory failure” unless there had been a positive test for the virus. Thus it was often random whether COVID-19 was listed as the cause of death.

The undercounting is a global problem, not just one in the United States. Dr. Christopher Murray of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington estimates that globally, excess deaths are about double the official COVID-19 death counts.

Excess deaths are often used to gauge mortality from an event or an epidemic. When Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in 2017, the official death toll stood for a year at 64. But Irizarry and other scholars used a variety of techniques to calculate that excess deaths in the aftermath exceeded 1,000, perhaps by a wide margin. As a result of the statistical work, the official death toll is now 2,975.

COVID-19 will inevitably continue to kill people in the weeks ahead. Those who die over the next week or two have already been infected, perhaps several weeks ago. Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the CDC, notes that even if one could end all new infections, thousands would still die from infections already contracted.

Given the uncertainty and the lags in data, why go through this exercise of estimating deaths? Because flawed numbers based on an undercount are already a central part of the discussion, informing policy decisions, and Trump has made them so.

“We have saved thousands and thousands of lives,” he said on May 1. “Hopefully, we are going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost.” In that context, it seems worthwhile to note that this milestone has already been exceeded.

The physical exam is both a ritual and a privilege of the doctor-patient relationship, forged out of the assumption that it can guide treatment to improve the patient’s health.

But social distancing of the COVID-19 pandemic has radically altered the way we connect with each other physically – and the way doctors interact with their patients.

When the Bay Area in March implemented a shelter-in-place policy to contain the spread of COVID-19, Alameda County’s Highland Hospital scrambled to comply. Literally overnight, our whole model of providing primary care transformed: We had to find ways to treat patients from a distance. Within a few days, we pivoted from providing exclusively office visits to conducting 90% of appointments by phone.

Such a rapid transformation would have been previously unimaginable. Despite technology that allows us to phone or video conference from almost anywhere across the globe, healthcare delivery systems have been slow to embrace telemedicine platforms. In December 2018, the American Medical Association reported that only 15% of physicians work in organizations that use telemedicine to care for patients.

Financial barriers were partly to blame for the poor adoption of telehealth among many safety-net institutions. A 2019 report by the RAND Corporation showed that most safety-net systems lost money on telemedicine because reimbursement was much lower than for office visits.

Humboldt County coronavirus protester’s ‘slaves’ sign goes viral Such barriers, however, have faded into the background in the setting of a global pandemic. COVID-19 has been a catalyst revolutionizing healthcare delivery over a matter of days rather than years.

Just as healthcare organizations have had to adapt to COVID-19, I find patients are equally flexible and resilient. When I call patients for a telephone visit, they are grateful. Many of my patients have mobility problems or take multiple buses to get to clinic; they appreciate the convenience of remaining home while also having their health needs addressed.

During this pandemic, patients are safer in their own houses. One of my patients recently commented: “Thank you for calling, doctor. I am glad we could talk over the phone so I don’t risk exposing myself.”

The positive experience reported by our patients is consistent with published data on the subject. Massachusetts General Hospital, which has provided telehealth services since 2012, boasts remarkable patient and provider satisfaction with its program.

To be sure, certain conditions require a physical exam to truly understand what is going on. And regular face-to-face contact will continue to be the foundation of any therapeutic relationship. Office visits are not obsolete, but it is my hope that COVID-19 will permanently transform the way we provide care, even after the pandemic has passed. The flexibility to choose between an in-person assessment and a telehealth visit is good for patients.

Financial incentives will be essential to maintaining telehealth services over the long term for public hospital systems such as Highland. On March 18, the California Department of Managed Care issued an unprecedented directive to its health plans to “reimburse providers at the same rate, whether a service is provided in-person or through telehealth.”

Reimbursing remote visits on a par with office visits will help safety-net organizations stay afloat financially during this crisis. It is unclear, however, whether reimbursement on this scale will continue after COVID-19 has died down. Continuing to robustly reimburse telehealth post-COVID-19 will sustain the tremendous innovation and improvement that has proved to be the bright side of this pandemic.

And it will help us stay close to patients, even at a distance.
