Some landlords have expressed a sense of aggrieved betrayal at tenants who have not paid their rents; on Facebook groups such as “ACTION: New York City Rent Strike,” which has more than four thousand members, tenants have posted screenshots of increasingly infuriated e-mails and text messages. One tenant posted about a landlord who threatened retaliation on the family car, another reported that a landlord claims the building is “not eligible” for the eviction freeze. Other landlords have encouraged tenants to sign rent-deferral agreements, in which the tenant agrees to add the unpaid rent onto future rent payments. Some landlords have reminded tenants of their own bills; they have suggested that tenants could get jobs at Amazon or at grocery stores. They have encouraged tenants to charge their rent to a credit card, or to set up automatic debits.

If some landlords seem to be in denial about the inevitable effects of mass unemployment, Eric Kober, who was the director of housing, economic, and infrastructure planning at the New York Department of City Planning from 1991 to 2017, suggests they look to the seventies, when population loss and lack of financing resulted in large swathes of dilapidated and abandoned housing stock. “Ultimately, the system is capitalized,” Kober explained. “There needs to be cash flow in the system to keep it going.” If renters cannot pay and landlords get into financial trouble, buildings end up deteriorating. If the landlords default, banks, which have historically been bad at property management, end up owning buildings, and housing conditions worsen further. Property-tax revenue falls. Kober described it as a “downward spiral” that, in the past, has only halted when the government has provided low-cost loans or appointed emergency managers. When the government itself experiences a financial shortfall, as New York will, such financing becomes difficult to come by.

After losing eight hundred thousand residents in the nineteen-seventies, the city’s population grew in the nineties, swelling by approximately a million people, without an equivalent increase in housing construction. But Kober corrected the idea I had seen circulating that people leaving New York as a result of the pandemic might make the city more comfortable for the middle class. “The only way the population goes down is if the city ceases to be a beacon of opportunity, which would be a terrible loss for New York and for the entire country,” he said. He recalled moving to the city in 1980, when it was “dirty, rundown, and just generally unappealing” because of poorly funded services and infrastructure. If the city faces a similar fiscal crisis, he said, “it will be cheaper for the middle class to find housing in the city, but they won’t want to be here.”

Durante (Danny) Galeotafiore is perhaps a typical example of a New York landlord who has enjoyed the city’s several-decade run of prosperity. He moved to New York City from Naples, Italy, in 1976, opened Danny’s Pizza, off the Montrose L stop, in 1983, and bought his first building in Williamsburg in 1992. After a few years of high crime rates, the neighborhood boomed. He now owns five buildings in Williamsburg and in Ridgewood, Queens, with fourteen residential and commercial units. His last rent-controlled tenant, an eighty-five-year-old woman, pays seven hundred and fifty dollars a month in a building where everyone else pays twenty-five hundred. Since the lockdown, most of his tenants have paid their rents as usual, but some—a hair stylist, a bartender—have come calling. He has given them discounts, but chastises them for not having savings.

The thought that the city might not continue its inexorable rise toward higher prices seemed unthinkable to him. “They’re building left and right,” he said to me. “Everywhere, there’s no more parking spaces! Everywhere, nothing is for sale, everything is taken. ” He envisions that the impact of the coronavirus will be more like that of 9/11, when the market took a brief dip and then bounced back, than the kind of exodus that New York City saw in the seventies. “Where are they going to go, back home?” he asked me of his tenants. “Nobody wants to go back home. Do you want to go back to Minneapolis?”

I didn’t think so, but I first moved here in 2003—I only know the gentrified New York of low crime and delicious coffee. Until last month, the reasons I thought about leaving were all related to real estate: the instability of renting, the dream of buying an affordable house, “nature.” Before the pandemic, I was contemplating giving up my rental apartment, on the border of Bushwick and Bed-Stuy, to look for something cheaper in 2021. I love my apartment, a spacious fourth-floor walkup in a prewar building, and have no desire to move, but the rent keeps going up. In the seventies, the area had lost thirty per cent of its populations and, in fires after the 1977 blackout, dozens of buildings. All of that was hard to imagine now, as successive waves of gentrification, of people like me moving in, seemed only to accelerate. The dry cleaner shut, then the coffee shop—profitable businesses killed by landlords who thought that they could do better. Both storefronts are empty now. A Starbucks opened down the street. I watched as expensive restaurants and bars opened, and then failed. I lived in Miami during the real-estate bubble of the mid-two-thousands, and I saw some of the same signs in the hastily built condos that popped up like mushrooms, the profit motive evident in their low ceilings and cramped bedrooms, the reigning architectural theory seemingly that, if a window is big enough, you won’t notice that you’re living in a place inimical to the resident’s well-being. The Google reviews of these new developments had tenants complaining about sound carrying through thin walls, weed smoke wafting through the entire building, the promised bike room that never materialized. The landlords seemed to imagine an apparently endless supply of rootless young professionals; you rarely saw ads targeted toward the families such buildings displaced.

The truth is, I do maintain a little Zillow file of houses in Minneapolis, where I grew up, where you can buy a cute two-bedroom house in a city with progressive politics for hundreds of thousands of dollars less than a one-bedroom apartment in Bushwick. I have no plans to leave, and I don’t need my own washing machine or my own lawn, but I like to fantasize about having a home with relatively fixed long-term costs that I could plan a life around. For decades, the reigning philosophy of New York politics has been that the state and city governments should encourage real-estate development but not rent regulation. Politicians, including Mayor Bill de Blasio, were just starting to murmur about introducing some kind of universal rent control when the pandemic hit. After years in which small-business owners and the middle class accepted insecurity as the price of living in the paradise of New York City, are landlords about to get a reckoning?

It’s too early to tell the long-term effect of the pandemic on the rental market. Rents in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn were at record highs as March began, according to StreetEasy, but the number of new listings dropped by fifty-two per cent in the second half of March. The exception was short-term rentals, listings for which rose by seventy per cent compared to the same time last year, as uncertain renters showed a preference for more flexibility. Since the pandemic began, my social-media feeds have been full of the politics of staying or leaving. The well-to-do have retreated to their hill stations, and recriminations about public health from those without the means to leave themselves come with a side of envy. I lurk on a Facebook sublet group primarily used by people who identify as “digital nomads,” who, now “stuck” in Tulum, Hawaii, or Bali, are trying to off-load their New York apartments with an urgency that recalls the evacuation of the Pieds-Noirs on the verge of Algerian independence—seeking recommendations for movers who can pack up their places in absentia, looking for someone to take over their leases and buy all their Restoration Hardware furniture. It’s unclear whether these people ever really lived in New York, or just sustained a circular Airbnb economy; it’s equally unclear if what would be devastating for the fortunes of SoulCycle and Sweetgreen would be so bad for New York City. But, speaking purely anecdotally, a lot of people seem to be leaving town, especially young people who can ride out the quarantine with their parents, and the wealthy, who, according to news reports, are rushing to rent houses in the suburbs and upstate. The June crop of college grads will not arrive this year. Trump has halted immigration. If the city is going to lose people, it will need to help the ones who stay.",100,High,Left,USA,1

People were trying to outdo each other.” Meanwhile, the Facebook page for the Klickitat County sheriff’s office was quiet. Merrit Monnat, the farmer in Goldendale, told me that, after Songer’s initial messages, people took the virus more seriously in the area, though maybe not seriously enough. “You still go to the grocery store and most people aren’t wearing masks,” she said. Keethler worried that the work that the state had done in March was at risk of coming undone. “We’re entering into a period where some of our efforts are now being undermined,” she said.

The day after Inslee’s press briefing, I went to see Songer, in Goldendale. As you drive east up the Columbia River gorge, the green of the lower Cascades gives way to yellow, then to brown. Trees disappear. The central and eastern side of Klickitat County has been farming and ranching land for a hundred and fifty years. White turbines loom in the hills above the valley: the county now produces more wind power than any other county in Washington. For a long time, there was a lumber mill in Goldendale, and more recently there was an aluminum plant. Both those industries are gone. The city’s largest employer is a waste-removal company: one of the biggest landfills in the country sits on the eastern edge of Klickitat, near the town of Roosevelt.

Songer’s citizen deputies include Ray Willis, a seventy-nine-year-old cattle and hay rancher, whom I spoke to outside his home. He was standing, unmasked, next to his pickup truck, which bore a decal signalling his membership in the Klickitat County Sheriff Posse Patrol. “I listen to Songer before I listen to the governor,” Willis told me. “That’s for dang sure.” He added, “Bob Songer’s got a pretty good head on his shoulders. He thinks about stuff. I’m not sure about our governor.”

That opinion was echoed by Keith Kreps, a fifth-generation cattle rancher, who spoke to me inside one of his family’s large, old barns north of White Salmon. “It’s like with the guns last year,” Kreps said. “Our sheriff is usually right.” For ranchers like Willis and Kreps, who can go days or weeks without venturing into town, a virus that is often transmitted in large gatherings does not seem all that personally threatening. Kreps operates on forty-four thousand acres. He was worried about the price of beef, which had plummeted, he said, when meat-packing plants began closing, and then rebounded a bit when some came back online. Kreps was afraid that, with the country entering a recession, and the market for beef falling, thieves would come to shoot his cattle, then sell it cheaply in neighboring communities. He said it had happened before, in the seventies.

“It’s good that we live where we do,” Kreps told me, “because we are away from where you have to do all that social distancing.” Just then, a rare visitor pulled up: his daughter-in-law, who had come to say hello. Like Kreps, she was not wearing a mask. After they spoke, Kreps returned to his worries about the commodity business. “They shut down all these packing plants, and that’s where it’s hurting us big time, all across the country,” he said, adding, “We need to get these guys back to work. Because if you have fat cattle to be your best prime rib, and they keep backing up, well, then they get fatter. Bigger costs more. We got to get those packing plants up, even if we got to go run around the clock.” Kreps wasn’t oblivious to the danger of meat-packing plants right now, he said. Along with nursing homes and prisons, meat-packing plants have emerged as one of the major sites of coronavirus outbreaks in the U.S. “We’ve got to get safe in the workplace,” Kreps told me. “I’ve heard all the horror stories about bosses saying you’ve got to come to work during the pandemic or you’re fired or whatever.” He added, “There’s only one way to get this to stop. We’ve got to develop a vaccine. That’s No. 1. But it’s going to take a long time. I’m not a scientist, but I know that.” On my way out, he offered his hand.

By the time I spoke to Kreps, Klickitat had had three confirmed coronavirus deaths, and just nineteen confirmed cases—though only “about four hundred” people in the county had been tested, Kristi Ridgeway, a clinical-division manager with the Klickitat County Health Department, told me. Most of the county’s cases have come in the central zone, which includes Goldendale. “Several of them, we were able to connect the dots—they gave it to each other,” Ridgeway said. “There was a gathering of folks—I can’t tell you more than that. Can’t tell you the town. But it was in mid-March, around when the governor was discussing that we need to limit socializing in groups.” Although Washington’s stay-at-home order was statewide, reopening is happening on a county-by-county basis—larger counties will reopen when they see a declining number of cases, and smaller counties will reopen after they’ve gone three weeks with no new cases. All of this, of course, depends on widespread testing. Ridgeway said that Klickitat had the capacity for such testing—“up to eight or nine thousand, if we had to, in our hospitals,” she said. The county has two hospitals—a community hospital, in Goldendale, and a private hospital, in White Salmon—both of which are conducting tests; hospital groups and clinics have volunteered to send mobile testing groups to the county’s harder-to-reach populations, but this has not happened yet. “Ultimately,” Ridgeway said, “it’s up to people to decide if they want to be” tested, “along with medical providers. Sometimes people with symptoms don’t want to be tested.”",100,High,Left,USA,1

Experts have identified a few indicators that must be met to begin opening nonessential businesses safely: rates of new cases should be low and falling for at least two weeks; hospitals should be able to treat all coronavirus patients in need; and there should be a capacity to test everyone with symptoms. But then what? What are the rules for reëntry? Is there any place that has figured out a way to open and have employees work safely, with one another and with their customers?

Well, yes: in health care. The Boston area has been a COVID-19 hotspot. Yet the staff members of my hospital system here, Mass General Brigham, have been at work throughout the pandemic. We have seventy-five thousand employees—more people than in seventy-five per cent of U.S. counties. In April, two-thirds of us were working on site. Yet we’ve had few workplace transmissions. Not zero: we’ve been on a learning curve, to be sure, and we have no way to stop our health-care workers from getting infected in the community. But, in the face of enormous risks, American hospitals have learned how to avoid becoming sites of spread. When the time is right to lighten up on the lockdown and bring people back to work, there are wider lessons to be learned from places that never locked down in the first place.

These lessons point toward an approach that we might think of as a combination therapy—like a drug cocktail. Its elements are all familiar: hygiene measures, screening, distancing, and masks. Each has flaws. Skip one, and the treatment won’t work. But, when taken together, and taken seriously, they shut down the virus. We need to understand these elements properly—what their strengths and limitations are—if we’re going to make them work outside health care.

Start with hygiene. People have learned that cleaning your hands is essential to stopping the transfer of infectious droplets from surfaces to your nose, mouth, and eyes. But frequency makes a bigger difference than many realize. A study conducted at a military boot camp found that a top-down program of hand washing five times a day cut medical visits for respiratory infections by forty-five per cent. Research on the 2002 SARS coronavirus outbreak found that washing hands more than ten times a day reduced people’s infection rate by even more. Disinfecting surfaces helps, too, and frequency probably matters, although I haven’t found good research on this. The key, it seems, is washing or sanitizing your hands every time you go into and out of a group environment, and every couple of hours while you’re in it, plus disinfecting high-touch surfaces at least daily.

That is not enough, however, because environmental transmission may account for as little as six per cent of COVID-19 infections. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, spreads primarily through respiratory droplets emitted by infected people when they cough, sneeze, talk, or simply exhale; the droplets are then breathed in by others. (Loud talking has even been shown to generate measurably more droplets than quieter talking.) This is why physical distancing is so important. We have all now learned the six-foot rule for preventing transmission of contagion-containing droplets. In my hospital system, observers gently remind us to stand the prescribed distance apart on escalators and in the elevator line; we allow no more than four people on elevators that used to carry more than twenty (a nightmare at shift changes). We’ve turned as many internal meetings, patient visits, and team huddles as possible into video meetings, even if someone is right across the hall. When we can’t avoid face-to-face encounters, we’ve put up Plexiglas barriers and spaced our chairs and work stations farther apart.

The six-foot rule isn’t some kind of infectious-disease law, however. There’s no stop sign at six feet that respiratory droplets obey. Public-health guidelines, in fact, originally set the at-risk distance at three feet or less, based on theoretical models going back to the nineteen-thirties, simulation studies, and experience in previous outbreaks, such as a 1981 outbreak of infectious meningitis in a Texas elementary-school classroom. That outbreak began in a cluster of five girls seated together on one side of the room. One infected the other four. Investigators later took measurements: the distance from one girl’s seat to another was about two and a half feet. Close contact at lunchtime spread the Meningococcus bacteria to other children, who transmitted the disease in their classrooms. In all, thirty-one children became ill or were carriers, and the spread was mainly in two classrooms where the chair-to-chair distance was three feet or less.

Even then, it was already apparent that respiratory illnesses frequently travel farther. Past guidelines from the C.D.C. also cited a 1948 military study in which almost fifty young men with confirmed Streptococcus infection—strep throat—were asked to cough, sneeze (with the help of a sneezing powder), and talk. Petri dishes and air samplers were placed at various distances to capture bacteria. All three activities dispersed contagion. Sneezing was the worst.

A study conducted at a naval base in the nineteen-forties found that germs were most commonly collected within a foot and a half of the sneezing subject, but in some cases they could travel much farther.

In the most common pattern, bacteria grew only on petri dishes placed on the floor a foot and a half from the sneezer. In ten per cent of cases, bacteria were captured only by the air samplers. In twenty per cent, no streptococci were recovered anywhere. But one recruit spewed large quantities of bacteria into petri dishes and air samplers almost ten feet away. “This subject,” the report noted, “was really an unusually good atomizer.” They’d caught him at a time of particular infectivity. A few days later, he wasn’t nearly as infectious anymore.

It has now become well recognized that, under the right conditions of temperature, humidity, and air circulation, forceful coughing or sneezing can propel a cloudburst of respiratory droplets more than twenty feet. Yet it wasn’t until the SARS epidemic in 2002, after several cases documenting more distant spread, that authorities doubled the at-risk distance from three to six feet. In one case, a man with SARS on a three-hour flight from Hong Kong to Beijing infected twenty-two people, five of whom died. The twenty-three passengers in the same row or the three rows in front of the index patient bore the highest risk: eight fell ill. So did the flight attendant for the patient’s section. Extending the recommended distance made sense. But six feet was simply a choice guided by practicality. People seven rows away—around eighteen feet—developed SARS, too.",100,High,Left,USA,1

During their fourth and final year, students commit to a busy courting ritual, called the Match, which dictates where, and in what specialty, they’ll spend the next phase of their training, as medical residents. They’ve ranked their favorite programs, and the programs, in turn, have ranked them; an algorithm at the National Resident Matching Program’s headquarters has worked out the pairings. The climax of this ordeal is Match Day, when fourth years assemble at formal celebrations to learn who will go where. At some schools, students open their white envelopes one by one on an auditorium stage, in front of a crowd of their peers. New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine gathers the class in a restaurant near Bellevue Hospital, where faculty advisers fan out batches of letters, like playing cards, for the students to draw in small groups. Those who get left with programs on the low end of their rank lists can slip away to sulk, while their luckier peers pop bottles of champagne. (Students who match nowhere at all learn their fates earlier in the week and scramble to clinch a slot wherever they can find one.)

Early this March, as social-distancing measures to control the spread of the novel coronavirus took effect in New York City, members of Grossman’s graduating class began to sense that their Match ceremony might not proceed as usual. Two weeks before Match Day, administrators notified them that the event would be limited to the graduating class, faculty, and staff—no guests allowed. Sam Dubin, a twenty-six-year-old fourth year, called his parents, in Cincinnati, who had planned to fly in for the occasion. At first, it still seemed possible that they could travel to New York anyway; Dubin and his boyfriend, an editor named Jeremy, had planned to have their parents meet on Match Day, at a Shabbat dinner after the ceremony. Then the flights stopped, and the restaurants closed. The Sunday before Match Day, N.Y.U. called off the gathering altogether. On Friday the 20th, in the Greenwich Village apartment that the couple shares, Dubin received his Match results over e-mail, patching in his family on FaceTime to share the news: he’d be remaining at N.Y.U., to complete a residency in primary-care internal medicine. Dubin is tall and talkative, with a crewcut and a silver ring in the cartilage of one ear. Whether out of bashfulness or Match Day etiquette, he was hesitant to admit that the N.Y.U. program had been his top choice. “I’ve always joked that I didn’t want to open that envelope around other people,” he told me, adding, “I guess I got what I asked for.”

Sam Dubin, who is twenty-six, graduated early from N.Y.U. to start working at Bellevue Hospital, where he had completed clinical rotations during school.

By then, the vast majority of medical schools had already cancelled classes and dismissed students from their clinical rotations. Dubin’s final course, a health-policy elective, had migrated online, but the pandemic soon pulled many guest speakers away, into more urgent tasks. “It was like, ‘Oh, the C.M.O. of Bellevue can’t come lecture us, because he’s busy restructuring the hospital,’ ” Dubin said. He and his classmates looked for ways to join the fight against the virus: he signed up for New York City’s Medical Reserve Corps; other students volunteered through N.Y.U., organizing P.P.E. collection. To combat a shortage of health-care workers, hospitals in the city were redeploying specialists from fields like dermatology and orthopedics to work in emergency rooms and intensive-care units. Governor Andrew Cuomo had called on retired physicians and nurses to return to work; buses were delivering health-care workers from out of town. On March 24th, Dubin e-mailed Linda Tewksbury, an associate dean at the Grossman School of Medicine, to ask whether he should schedule volunteer slots with the Medical Reserve Corps or stay tuned for opportunities at N.Y.U. Tewksbury wrote back an hour later: “There will be an email going out about this before the end of the day. . . . ”

That evening, N.Y.U. became the first medical school to mobilize its fourth-year students. “We ask for your help,” the dean wrote, in bold letters, in a message sent to Grossman’s graduating class. If enough students expressed interest, the note explained, the school would move to graduate fourth years early and send them to work as new physicians in the city’s overloaded hospitals. In a normal year, the months after matching serve as a future doctor’s “senior spring,” a respite between the slog of coursework behind and the extreme demands of residency ahead. Dubin had planned to visit the Grand Canyon with his parents, then fly to San Francisco for a wedding that Jeremy had agreed to officiate. One of his peers, who was looking forward to an overseas trip, recalled thinking, when he first saw Tewksbury’s e-mail, I don’t want to fucking do this. But with travel restricted and lockdowns taking effect across the globe, any vacation plans now seemed impossible. Rather than “bake sourdough and play computer games,” Dubin told me, he wanted to contribute. In the first twelve hours after N.Y.U.’s request went out, more than forty of his classmates expressed interest.

Before the pandemic caused N.Y.U. to cancel its Match Day ceremony, Dubin (right) and his boyfriend, Jeremy, had planned to introduce their parents after the event.

In the end, fifty-two fourth years—almost half of the class—decided to graduate early. On April 3rd, they positioned themselves in front of their screens for an ad-hoc commencement ceremony conducted over a video-conferencing site. Dubin logged in, with Jeremy seated beside him, from a small second bedroom that they use as an office. Several graduates wore caps and gowns; one had fashioned a makeshift diploma from a manila envelope. One by one, in a prerecorded montage, their teachers and advisers appeared onscreen to offer words of encouragement; some addressed them from the hospital, wearing P.P.E. Steven Abramson, the chair of the Department of Medicine, welcomed them as “members of what we now call the COVID army.” To conclude, Tewksbury asked the new doctors to unmute their microphones and recite the Hippocratic oath. A few hours later, an emergency push alert lit up the phones of New Yorkers, calling on licensed health-care workers to volunteer. When Dubin saw the message, he thought to himself, I’m on my way.

A bit of conventional wisdom within medicine holds that the most dangerous time to be a patient in the hospital is July, when a new class of interns enters the workforce and the previous year’s class assumes new responsibilities. In America, this is known as the July effect; in the United Kingdom, where new doctors start in August, it’s called the Killing Season. It’s unclear how much of an actual risk the turnover poses to patients—various studies have attempted to compare outcomes, with conflicting results—in part because the hospital hierarchy is designed to limit the responsibilities of new doctors. Under normal circumstances, medical training involves a formal system of apprenticeship, in which interns work under the supervision of junior residents—who, in turn, work under more senior ones—and whole teams of trainees report to attending physicians. Interns “present” patients to their teams, relying on experienced doctors to review their notes and treatment plans.

The pandemic, and the strain that it has put on the health-care system, has reconfigured both the physical layouts of hospitals and the teams that staff them. During Dubin’s first week as a new doctor, in a unit on the sixteenth floor of Bellevue, his team included an older resident in psychiatry, a rheumatology fellow, and a gerontologist who normally works in one of the hospital’s outpatient clinics. Having completed rotations at Bellevue during school, Dubin knew the setting better than some of the doctors and many of the travelling nurses who heeded Cuomo’s call. But, even to him, the I.C.U. appeared unrecognizable: I.V. stands had been stationed outside closed doors, he said, creating the look of a “ghostly arcade,” so that nurses could treat patients without exposing themselves to the virus. One of Dubin’s classmates, Lizbeth Hu, graduated early and now works in an oncology unit at Tisch Hospital. Though her team doesn’t treat COVID-19 patients, Hu said, they still suffer from personnel shortages brought on by the pandemic. “Putting a patient on narcotics, or ordering a blood transfusion, or tailoring antibiotic regimens—these are things that last week I would never have imagined doing on my own, or being able to do correctly,” Hu told me at the end of her third shift. “And I’ve done all of those things this week. Really everybody you’re working with is doing something they’re not used to.”

Lizbeth Hu, a twenty-six-year-old graduate of N.Y.U., is working in an oncology ward on the fourteenth floor of Tisch Hospital.

Adjusting to less oversight is a standard part of the learning curve for new physicians: submitting medication orders no longer requires a co-signature, so there had better not be an extra zero on the dosage; signing off on a patient’s D.N.R. status may suddenly fall to them. The pandemic has made the decisions faced by new doctors more complicated, and more perilous. Janna Minehart, another N.Y.U. graduate, started work in a COVID-19 ward at Tisch, two floors above Hu. A native of San Jose, California, Minehart is calm and forthright, with long red hair that she wears in a loose bun during work. On her first day, she was assigned a middle-aged patient with both COVID-19 and metastatic cancer. Less than an hour into her shift, Minehart received a page from a nurse: the patient had developed a gaze deviation and weakness on one side of her body. “Oh, shit,” Minehart recalled thinking when she reached the room. “She’s having a stroke.” Because of the limits on patient contact, Minehart hadn’t conducted a full neurological exam; because the patient was new, she couldn’t tell how much her current condition deviated from her baseline, either. “Do I do a little bit more history-taking?” Minehart now wondered. “Do I do a little bit more of a physical exam, before I call the stroke code?” There’s a saying that students learn about the treatment of stroke patients: time lost is brain lost. When Minehart’s resident advised her to call the code, she realized that she didn’t yet know how to activate the page system to summon the on-call neurologist.",100,High,Left,USA,1

Some days, I organize my rounds not by where patients are located but by what language they speak: Spanish, Chinese, English, Creole. That way, I can keep the same interpreter on the phone as I make my way from room to room. One in five Americans speaks a language other than English at home; half of New Yorkers do.

One morning, I gown up and step inside a patient’s room, the interpreter on speakerphone in my scrubs pocket. The patient is a deliveryman I admitted earlier that week; his breathing has worsened each day, requiring escalating doses of oxygen via nasal cannula, and now a face mask. I must tell him that, should his breathing worsen further, the next step will be intubation.

I speak carefully, in short paragraphs, pausing to allow the interpreter to translate. The man stares at me from behind his mask, waiting to learn what his future holds. Thirty seconds after I stop talking, as the interpreter completes her translation, his dark eyes widen, and slow recognition spreads across his face.

He asks what intubation entails, and I explain. Again a delay; again the unwelcome news starts to register. He asks how long he’ll remain on the ventilator. We can’t know for sure, I say, but I hope it’s not long. Tears escape his eyes and his breathing quickens. I worry that the conversation itself will tip him into extremis. During the coronavirus pandemic, I’ve avoided entering rooms more than once a day, but today I vow to return.

Outside, I rub foam sanitizer into my hands and remove my face shield. I forget that the interpreter is still on the line.

“Will that be all, doctor?” she says, a minute later, from my pocket.

“Yeah, thank you,” I reply. “That was pretty rough, right?”

“Yes,” she says. “There have been a lot of those conversations lately.”

In New York City, social distancing is working. The virus has claimed at least twelve thousand lives, but single-day deaths have declined steadily since April 7th, when nearly five hundred and sixty people died of COVID-19. New cases and hospitalizations have also fallen in recent weeks, even though many hospitals remain nearly full.

But, as this wave of the coronavirus starts to slow, I can’t help but notice that many of the people still getting infected are those who don’t have the luxury of distance—those who, by necessity or by trade, expose themselves and their families to the virus every day. We’re now debating whether it’s safe to reopen the economy, but for essential workers it never closed. Each morning, during the apex of the deadliest pandemic in a century, these men and women have been venturing out into the epicenter of disease, to cook and clean, deliver food and carry mail, drive buses and stock shelves, patrol the streets and tend to the ill. Many have paid with their health—some with their lives.

It’s becoming clear that essential workers experience a disproportionate share of death and disease owing to COVID-19. During one week not long ago, I cared for a police officer, a grocery-store clerk, and a bus driver. During another, my clinical service of fifteen patients included three food deliverymen. (The last time I can recall caring for a delivery worker was more than two years ago: his leg was broken after he was hit by an S.U.V. at a busy Manhattan intersection.)

The burden falls unevenly among racial and ethnic groups: in New York City, people of color comprise three-quarters of the city’s essential workers. Three-fifths of cleaning workers are Latino; more than forty per cent of public-transit workers are black. Latinos comprise twenty-nine per cent of the city’s population, but thirty-four per cent of all cases; black people are twenty-two per cent of the population but represent twenty-eight per cent of COVID-19 deaths. Many factors contribute. Communities of color have higher rates of poverty, housing instability, and chronic disease. They’re more likely to consist of dense or multigenerational households, in which the virus spreads more easily. These communities have experienced frequent, sometimes egregious, bias from the health-care system, which has engendered lasting mistrust and leads some people to forgo needed care.

In a pandemic, just going to work is risky. “All one has to do is stand on a platform and you’ll see that the trains are filled with black and brown and low-income people going into communities to service those who are able to telecommute,” Eric Adams, Brooklyn’s borough president, recently said. (About a hundred of the city’s public-transit workers have died of COVID-19 since the first M.T.A. worker death was reported, on March 26th.) And yet many essential workers have little choice but to stay on the job during the pandemic—either because they can’t afford to take time off or because they’re told that they aren’t allowed to. One study found that fifty-five per cent of retail and food-service workers, many of whom have been declared essential, have no paid sick leave, and fewer than ten per cent of them can take two weeks off—the recommended COVID-19 quarantine period.

The basic process by which doctors collect a medical history has not changed in a century. You start with a patient’s “chief complaint”—the primary reason for seeking medical care. You make your way through the “history of present illness,” exploring the onset, pace, character, and severity of symptoms. (When exactly did that cough start? What color is your phlegm? Does your chest hurt more when breathing deeply or walking quickly?) Then you move to preëxisting conditions, medications, and allergies.

Tucked somewhere down below is the social history. At its best, the social history is how we explore who patients are as individuals—how their jobs and hobbies and lives intersect with their current predicaments. It’s meant to illuminate how nonmedical factors may have contributed to illness, but also to give us a more complete understanding of what’s important to the person we’re caring for. For busy doctors, though, it’s often reduced to a few mechanical questions: Do you smoke? Drink alcohol? Do drugs? The entire social history in a doctor’s note might read, “No toxic habits.”

It’s turning out that, in this pandemic, social history is profoundly important. As we learn more about the epidemiology of the virus, I find myself exploring these details with great interest. Where do you live? How many rooms? How many people are in those rooms? Does your work require you to come in close contact with others? The answers reveal how much risk specific households and families are shouldering.

One of the many new faces in my hospital belongs to Khalid Haynes, a softspoken African-American man in his mid-twenties. COVID-19 has created administrative demands in addition to clinical ones; Haynes is one of many new patient coördinators who have arrived to keep the hospital running. (Other new hires have been helping to build new I.C.U.s, or transfer patients between facilities.) He began his career as a personal trainer, before starting work as a patient coördinator at an integrative-health clinic. There, he answered phones, greeted patients, and verified insurance; as the coronavirus began to spread across the city, his clinic turned to telemedicine, and he began working remotely. In late March, he received a call from his manager saying that he was being dispatched to the hospital as an essential worker. In his new role, he’d help troubleshoot and distribute iPads to doctors, so that their patients could see their families.

Haynes has kind eyes, horn-rimmed glasses, and an easygoing charm. During our first encounter, I rushed past in a pre-caffeine daze, and he stopped me to ask about my day, insisting on a genuine answer. Two weeks after he started at the hospital, his grandmother died of COVID-19. “That gave me a really painful perspective on how important this role is,” he told me. “I couldn’t see my grandmother before she died. I don’t want that to happen to anyone else.”",100,High,Left,USA,1

We think of COVID-19 as a disease of the respiratory tract. When future generations look back on this pandemic, its iconic symbol will probably be the ventilator. But, although respiratory problems are at the core of the disease, COVID-19 has revealed itself to be more than a straightforward viral pneumonia. Doctors around the world—including in the emergency department where we work, at Mount Sinai Hospital, in Manhattan—have learned the hard way that the coronavirus doesn’t confine its ravages to the lungs. COVID-19 can push kidneys into failure, send the body’s immune system into catastrophic overdrive, and cause blood clots that impede circulation to the lungs, heart, or brain. It’s a disease of remarkable complexity, which even the most experienced doctors are struggling to understand.

On blogs, podcasts, and #medtwitter, members of the medical community have been trading stories and theories about COVID-19’s intricacies. Often, their conversation has followed the methodology of critical-care doctors. Physicians who work in I.C.U.s tend to talk not about symptoms or diseases—chest pain, diabetes—but about organ systems, which can malfunction and interact in complex ways. System by system, a picture of COVID-19 is emerging. Clarifying it may mean the difference between life and death for thousands of people in the months to come.

The shortness of breath that’s most characteristic of COVID-19 is reasonably well understood. It originates in the gossamer air sacs of the lungs, called alveoli, where blood and air are separated by such thin membranes that oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass into and out of the bloodstream, respectively. Between them, the lungs have somewhere in the neighborhood of six hundred million alveoli. Severe COVID-19 causes many of them to either collapse or fill with fluid. The virus attacks the cells lining the alveoli; our overactive immune systems, in trying to fight the virus, may be damaging them as well. The result is that not enough oxygen gets into the blood.

Doctors trying to solve this problem have two basic tools at their disposal: oxygen and pressure. They can give patients concentrated oxygen beyond the usual twenty-one per cent that is found in normal air. Alternatively, using a CPAP machine or ventilator, they can create a kind of sustained air pressure within the lungs—“positive end-expiratory pressure,” or PEEP—which keeps the alveoli open, and thus more receptive to oxygen, at moments when the lungs would ordinarily be emptier of air. (Imagine breathing in and out while leaning through the window of a moving car: that lungs-full-of-air feeling is PEEP.) Doctors have also been improving oxygenation by “proning” patients—that is, periodically turning them onto their stomachs. Such positioning takes advantage of gravity to match areas of air-filled lung with areas of higher blood flow.

All this makes straightforward mechanical sense. Still, mysteries hover around the certainties. Doctors track the “oxygen saturation” of patients with COVID-19—they monitor the percentage of hemoglobin molecules in the bloodstream that are currently carrying oxygen. Ordinarily, in patients with healthy lungs, an oxygen-saturation level below ninety per cent is cause for grave concern: when vital organs such as the heart and brain become starved for oxygen, the risk of death skyrockets. But doctors are finding, bizarrely, that some COVID-19 patients can remain subjectively comfortable even when their saturation levels fall far below these ranges. This “silent hypoxemia” is frightening for physicians, who associate such low numbers with imminent death. And it’s deeply mystifying, since the numbers seem implausible.

Is silent hypoxemia a sign that, even though a patient feels relatively well, the bottom is about to drop out? Or is the virus somehow interfering with the blood’s hemoglobin, or with the parts of the brain that warn us when we need more oxygen? Theories abound. Meanwhile, silent hypoxemia complicates the decision to intubate. In the early days of COVID-19 treatment, low oxygen saturation that failed to improve was generally seen as an indication that intubation was necessary right away. But in early March reports of comfortable patients with discordantly low saturation rates began spreading rapidly among doctors online. One particularly arresting image, posted on Twitter by a New York City emergency-medicine physician, shows a patient calmly reading on her phone while her overhead monitor reveals a saturation rate of just fifty-four per cent. Until we better understand the physiology behind silent hypoxemia, and why some people experience it and others do not, we will have no choice but to live with the mystery, scrutinizing some patients who have oxygen levels in the seventies and eighties, and whom we might have rushed to intubate in the past.

Within hours of a viral invasion, the body’s immune system swings into action. The “innate” immune system, which recognizes protein structures common to many pathogens, reacts first, by releasing a family of chemical distress signals called cytokines. They spread from the site of the infection, instructing the body to raise its temperature and divert blood flow to the affected area; they also activate other immune-system cells, which begin developing antibodies specifically targeting the invaders. Without cytokines, the immune system would slumber while infections wreak havoc. But the cytokine system has a weakness. Some pathogens can provoke it in a perverse way, so that it goads the immune system as a whole into overdrive. In what’s known as a cytokine storm, fever and inflammation spike out of control. It’s unclear why some patients might experience this phenomenon while others do not.

Faced with a cytokine storm in a patient, a doctor can try to modulate the immune system’s response. The problem is striking the right balance. While some patients may benefit from a degree of medically induced immunosuppression, there are others for whom such an intervention could cause great harm. Some hospitals have begun cautiously administering steroids or drugs that inhibit the cytokine IL-6. But high-quality clinical-trial data about such treatments won’t be ready for a long time. Moreover, even if early results are encouraging, we will still have to distinguish between those patients who will benefit from immunosuppression and those who won’t. In the past, physicians have interpreted elevated blood levels of the protein ferritin as a sign that a cytokine storm is in progress. Some are now using that analysis in the treatment of COVID-19. Only time will tell if they’re right.",100,High,Left,USA,1

H. Chan School of Public Health, has devoted her professional life to studying malaria and other infectious diseases. As news of a novel coronavirus emerged from China, Buckee realized that her area of expertise—how infectious diseases evolve as they move through vulnerable populations—would be valuable to health-care workers and elected officials as the virus spread across the globe. “The methods and the tools are the same, and epidemiological models are easily adapted,” Buckee told me. “But, for many of us, like me, we work with endemic pathogens. COVID-19 is new. There is so much we don’t know.” Since the most urgent imperative was to “flatten the curve” of infections, it was crucial to know where public-health strategies like stay-at-home orders were working and where they were not. Buckee quickly assembled a consortium of infectious-disease researchers to make the data accessible to policymakers—data that they did not yet have.

At just about the same time, Ian Allen, a former marine and C.I.A. paramilitary officer, cold-called Harvard’s School of Public Health and asked if there was anything that his new company, Camber Systems, could do to help with the pandemic. Soon afterward, Allen was connected with Buckee, the associate director of the School of Public Health’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics. Buckee had created the COVID-19 Mobility Data Network, a network of epidemiologists from universities around the world, to try to track the efficacy of social-distancing measures. Allen agreed to provide Buckee with the software to query and scrub data collected by tech companies and use it to track the coronavirus’s spread without violating Americans’ privacy. “I wasn’t really expecting ever to hear back, assuming that Harvard, of all places, would have all the resources they’d ever need,” Allen told me, while standing in a field in rural Virginia as his son shot at tin cans with a BB gun. (Like many parents, Allen has been homeschooling his children during the pandemic; this was geometry class.) “Caroline asked me if we could help aggregate location data. Just aggregating the data and anonymizing it in the right way to protect privacy would take some of the burden off of her.” Allen reached out to a handful of data firms, including Unacast, Kochava, and X-Mode. All agreed to provide their data for free.

Camber Systems, of which Allen is the C.E.O., is a year-old startup that, among other things, hopes to offer federal, state, and local government agencies ways to use commercially harvested location data to improve their operations without violating privacy laws. Shortly before the pandemic, Allen and his business partner, Navin Vembar, a mathematician who served as the chief technology officer of the General Services Administration, were searching for potential clients, talking with officials in Madison, Wisconsin, about using location data to shore up tourism and distribute the city’s public resources equitably. Assisting Buckee’s COVID-19 Mobility Data Network was the kind of project they envisioned when they launched their company with Hangar, a venture-capital firm that funds companies that use technology in the public interest.

By presenting aggregated location data in an accessible and searchable format for epidemiologists studying COVID-19, the project would enable researchers and policymakers to see how members of the public move around their communities. When paired with other metrics, such as the number of new infections or mortality rates, the data would guide policymakers as they grappled with when and where to lift stay-at-home orders. Facebook is also supplying the network with data. According to Buckee, correspondence between the various groups gives researchers confidence in the trends they are seeing. “One data set is not going to show what’s going on,” she said.

Location data are the bread and butter of “ad tech.” They let marketers know you recently shopped for running shoes, are trying to lose weight, and have an abiding affection for kettle corn. Apps on cell phones emit a constant trail of longitude and latitude readings, making it possible to follow consumers through time and space. Location data are often triangulated with other, seemingly innocuous slivers of personal information—so many, in fact, that a number of data brokers claim to have around five thousand data points on almost every American. It’s a lucrative business—by at least one estimate, the data-brokerage industry is worth two hundred billion dollars. Though the data are often anonymized, a number of studies have shown that they can be easily unmasked to reveal identities—names, addresses, phone numbers, and any number of intimacies. As Buckee knew, public-health surveillance, which serves the community at large, has always bumped up against privacy, which protects the individual. But, in the past, public-health surveillance was typically conducted by contract tracing, with health-care workers privately interviewing individuals to determine their health status and trace their movements. It was labor-intensive, painstaking, memory-dependent work, and, because of that, it was inherently limited in scope and often incomplete or inefficient. (At the start of the pandemic, there were only twenty-two hundred contact tracers in the country.)

Digital technologies, which work at scale, instantly provide detailed information culled from security cameras, license-plate readers, biometric scans, drones, G.P.S. devices, cell-phone towers, Internet searches, and commercial transactions. They can be useful for public-health surveillance in the same way that they facilitate all kinds of spying by governments, businesses, and malign actors. South Korea, which reported its first COVID-19 case a month after the United States, has achieved dramatically lower rates of infection and mortality by tracking citizens with the virus via their phones, car G.P.S. systems, credit-card transactions, and public cameras, in addition to a robust disease-testing program. Israel enlisted Shin Bet, its secret police, to repurpose its terrorist-tracking protocols. China programmed government-installed cameras to point at infected people’s doorways to monitor their movements.

As unlikely as it may seem that such privacy-compromising measures will be adopted in the United States, the Trump Administration reportedly summoned tech executives to the White House to discuss sharing data with the government. Not much is known about the meeting. The Administration has classified all its discussions about COVID-19, and it later denounced Politico for reporting that the White House was in talks with tech firms to create a national coronavirus surveillance system. Last week, Gizmodo reported that Palantir, a secretive data-analytics firm owned by the conservative billionaire and the Trump backer Peter Thiel, has a contract from the Trump Administration to build a database to track the spread of the virus. Palantir is best known for its work with the N.S.A. and ICE, where its software is used to track undocumented immigrants. (Other private surveillance companies, most notably the Israeli firm NSO, are also pitching COVID-19 tracing to governments around the world.)

“We’re all too familiar with the historical record of crises, where new powers in the hands of governments and corporations lead to them holding on to them indefinitely,” Adam Schwartz, a lawyer with the digital-rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told me. Schwartz pointed out that most of the sweeping investigative powers given to the intelligence community after the 9/11 terrorist attack are still in place nearly two decades later. As Senator Maria Cantwell wrote, on April 9th, in her opening remarks for a paper hearing by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on the role of Big Tech during the pandemic, “Rights and data surrendered temporarily during an emergency can become very difficult to get back.”

As difficult as it is now to look ahead, lawmakers like Cantwell and privacy advocates like Schwartz are asking us to think about how much privacy we are willing to sacrifice to combat a rampaging virus. If we accept government data tracking, the surveillance necessary to curtail COVID-19 could become a permanent fixture in our lives. It’s an unknowable trade-off. “In this particular case, if we have technology for minimizing harm, we have a moral obligation to use it,” Marcello Ienca, a bioethicist at the Swiss university ETH Zurich, told me. “But we have to merge it with the best available technology in the areas of cybersecurity and privacy.” To do this right, Ienca added, the public-health experts need to work with privacy advocates.",100,High,Left,USA,1

In a recent appearance on “Team Trump Online”—a nightly video series that serves as a substitute for campaign rallies and often attracts more than a million viewers—he complained that his father is having to wage war against “the deep-state guys” and unchecked attacks from “influencers on the other side.” He said that each reporter at the White House briefings “has an agenda, and that is to destroy Donald Trump.” Joe Biden “can’t remember where he is fifty per cent of the time,” Trump, Jr., said, but he can count on the “media lackeys” who are the “marketing wing of the Democrat Party.” The Democrats, he added, are “becoming the party of socialism and communism.” That includes Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib—“you know, the Hamas caucus in Congress.” As for the COVID-19 outbreak, which has caused more than eighty thousand deaths in the U.S. to date, he said, “China basically screwed the whole world.”

Venom and victimization largely define the President’s public persona, and the same holds true for the online campaign. Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee in early March, and the COVID-19 pandemic put a halt to barnstorming a few weeks later, but the rhetoric of Trump’s campaign has barely budged. On March 12th, as the coronavirus crisis was taking hold in the United States, it e-mailed its supporters a photograph of Trump, ruddy face fully made up, a flag pin in his lapel, sitting behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, looking steely. The e-mail said that there is “no room for partisanship, and the President is calling on both parties in Congress to unite.” The very next day, when Trump declared a national emergency, the campaign reverted to form, blasting “Sleepy Joe” and “Crazy Bernie.” Last weekend, after the Justice Department dropped its charges against Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national-security adviser, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I., the campaign crowed, in a fund-raising text, “Justice for Gen Flynn! A WITCH HUNT from day 1! ALL GIFTS TRIPLED TO DRAIN THE SWAMP.”

Anyone who has attended Trump’s rallies, where thousands of fans in MAGA hats whoop and cheer at his insults and diatribes, can attest that the President, ever a showman, knows how to play to his target audiences. And, yet, as Biden edges into the lead in key states, such as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Florida, pollsters and political strategists are questioning whether Trump’s perennial pitch can carry him to victory on November 3rd. His political base is loyal but narrow. When Democrats scored heavily in the suburbs in the 2018 midterms, and captured a majority in the House of Representatives, it was women voters who made the difference. A recent Quinnipiac poll in Florida showed Trump lagging behind Biden among women, and also among two groups that delivered crucial support in 2016: voters over the age of sixty-five and voters who dislike both candidates. When I asked Douglas Schwartz, the director of the Quinnipiac poll, about the survey, he said that Biden does better among both groups on honesty, leadership, and empathy. “These numbers are a warning sign for his campaign,” Schwartz said of the President.

The Trump campaign brags about an army of field organizers, the cell-phone numbers of tens of millions of supporters, and a new app that connects voters to news, virtual events, and volunteer opportunities, from fund-raising to voter registration. Each is a significant upgrade from Trump’s 2016 effort, which relied on his outsized personality, his televised rallies, and the power of social media. The current operation, led by Brad Parscale, who ran Trump’s successful Facebook marketing campaign in 2016, has raised more than seven hundred and thirty million dollars. In cash-on-hand, Biden lags tens of millions of dollars behind. “It’s not like a campaign of grievance and anger and fear hasn’t been a pillar of American politics since there was an American politics,” Cornell Belcher, a Democratic pollster who worked on Barack Obama’s Presidential campaigns, said. “That’s exactly how Trump won.” Republicans are right to be worried, Belcher added, but even as Trump struggles to expand his base COVID-19 and the plunging economy are making predictions difficult. “Given that environment, where people are afraid and anxious—and understandably so—can you count out a candidate peddling grievance and fear?”

In hundreds of different versions of its standard pitch, Trump’s campaign complains, boasts, and beseeches. The President, his surrogates, and the campaign staff spray a familiar buckshot of belittling nicknames and insults at a cast that includes “Sleepy Joe,” “Crazy Bernie,” and “Crooked Hillary,” who were recently joined by “Cheatin’ Obama.” An e-mail on Monday, targeting Biden, asked supporters to “show the Left that you REJECT their corrupt candidate,” while one on Friday called Biden “a certified CROOK.” During a recent “Team Trump Online” broadcast, Parscale bragged about “a roll of Hillary Clinton toilet paper that I use every time I’m in a bad mood. I have boxes of it, and I take it into the bathroom, and it’s just enjoyable.”

Another regular target is the “Lamestream” media, the “enemy of the people,” ever in cahoots with “the Radical Left-wing MOB.” Together, Trump warned in an e-mail earlier this year, these elements are pushing a “non-stop propaganda campaign of LIES to try and destroy me.” With nary a mention of his own wealthy backers, Trump slams “the establishment,” along with the “Hollywood elite” and “foreign enemies,” declaring, in one solicitation, “They all HATE you, and that’s why they want to steal your vote. It’s US against THEM.” The April 27th “Team Trump Online” session was led by Katrina Pierson, a former Tea Party activist, whose guests included Representative Dan Crenshaw, a military veteran from Texas. She described Barack Obama as a “faint-hearted” Commander-in-Chief, while Crenshaw told viewers that Democrats “will lie through their teeth. They’re doing it all the time.”

In its texts and e-mails, the campaign seeks donations and valuable voter contact information by offering a steady supply of Trump-branded merchandise, from football jerseys, Christmas ornaments, and doormats to plastic straws, a swipe at liberal locales that have been banning them to help the environment. The offers have continued unabated during the COVID-19 crisis. Last Saturday, the campaign wrote supporters to say Trump knows that recent weeks have been “extremely difficult for Americans from all across the Nation.” The e-mail said that the President is grateful for “your unwavering support” and wants to do “something special for you to show how much your loyalty means to him.” The message continued, “He’s asked us to give you EXCLUSIVE ACCESS to get our Official Trump-Pence Pint Glasses.” The cost for a set: thirty-one dollars. “But, we have an extremely limited supply, so we can only hold them until 11:59 PM TONIGHT.”

I asked David Sable, the former head of the marketing agency Y. & R., to assess the Trump campaign as a marketing effort. “His base loves it,” said Sable, who explained that Trump has “brand power” derived from what he called the “brand experience,” which is part show, part substance. “The key is to get those people to recruit other people. If you can do that, you’re way ahead of the game. That’s basically the way the guy operates,” Sable said. According to Sable, Trump’s team, to its credit, “understands simplicity.” The “Make America Great Again” message, in 2016, was straightforward, and so is the “Keep America Great” message in 2020, according to Sable: “At the end of the day, I’ve done a great job, I will continue to do a great job, and I will fix this to get back to the great job I was doing.”",100,High,Left,USA,1

Crouch, who is forty-two, with slender braids down to her knees, had been feeling anxious about the spread of the coronavirus. At home, she cared for her elderly mother, and for a half-dozen children, including a son with sickle-cell anemia, a blood disorder. She herself had chronic bronchitis, and worried that it put her at risk. Many people in her neighborhood lacked access to high-quality medical care. (Black residents of Louisiana have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic; they make up about thirty per cent of the state’s population, but account for almost sixty per cent of documented deaths from the virus.) She thought, This is some serious stuff. After scrolling through a few too many coronavirus stories on her phone that Saturday morning, she got dressed, spritzed herself with her favorite perfume, A Thousand Wishes, and drove to a dollar store with her two-year-old son, Kyi, to buy shelter-in-place supplies.

On the way, Crouch failed to stop at a stop sign in Jefferson Parish and was pulled over by the police. She was then arrested for a string of petty crimes, including driving without proper registration and with a stolen license plate that police valued at twenty-five dollars. The most serious charge resulted from a nine-year-old warrant for possession of marijuana. As Crouch was put in the back of a police car, with Kyi, she pleaded with the arresting officers to call her daughter Tae, who worked as a security guard. Tae sped across the Mississippi River, arriving just in time to pry her sobbing little brother from the police car and prevent him from being turned over to child-protective services. “I call him Hip Baby, because he’s attached to my mom’s hip,” Tae told me. She took Kyi home, but it was “hell on earth trying to tame him without her.” The cops drove Crouch to the Jefferson Parish jail.

In late March, Governor John Bel Edwards announced that Louisiana had the fastest-growing coronavirus infection rate in the world. According to state reports at the end of last year, Louisiana also had the highest incarceration rate in the country. The pandemic posed an immediate threat in the state’s jails, where cells are crowded and poorly sanitized, and people frequently cycle in and out of custody. Since 2013, the main jail in Orleans Parish has been under a consent decree for what the Department of Justice called “dangerous and unacceptable” conditions, including “inadequate medical care.” Prisons, too, present a contagion risk; they have less rapid turnover than jails, but staff come and go, and large populations and underfunded health services make outbreaks hard to contain. Ben Smith, who served thirteen years in the Louisiana State Penitentiary, commonly known as Angola, remembers how quickly infections passed through the prison each year. Lacking accessible treatment, men devised remedies using instant soup, garlic, oranges, and peppermint leaves. Smith—who now works for the First 72+, a nonprofit that helps people adjust to life after incarceration—worried about his friends who were still inside, among them an older man with Stage IV colon cancer who was nearing parole. “Imagine a prisoner serving a life sentence, with age on him. If he got the virus, would they choose to give him a ventilator?” Smith asked. “It’s a very, very contagious virus. Now you could be sentenced to death.”

Shopping Cartoon by Ellis Rosen

At the Jefferson Parish jail, Crouch shared an intake cell with four other women. There were mats on the floor, for sleeping, and the only source of drinking water was a faucet above a toilet without a lid, where some of Crouch’s cellmates, apparently detoxing from drugs, spent the night vomiting. She draped an extra sleeping mat over her body, hoping that it would shield her from germs, but a guard chastised her—one person, one mat, she was told. Crouch asked the guards, “Y’all sure those ladies don’t have the virus?” By the time she reached Tae on the jailhouse phone, she was crying. She told her daughter, “I’ve got to get out of here before this virus gets me.”

For decades, community groups have pointed out the social costs of mass incarceration: its failure to address the root causes of addiction and violence; its steep fiscal price tag; its deepening of racial inequalities. The coronavirus pandemic has exposed another danger of the system: its public-health risks. In April, the American Civil Liberties Union worked with epidemiologists and statisticians to show that, without protective measures in jails and prisons, including rapid reductions in incarcerated populations, the virus could kill an additional hundred thousand Americans. Families of the incarcerated—along with national legal organizations, grassroots groups, and religious leaders—began to push for mass releases, focussing on defendants arrested for nonviolent offenses, those nearing the ends of their sentences, and the medically vulnerable. In Philadelphia, outside the Criminal Justice Center, protesters lined up coffins to mark the coronavirus-related death of a woman who had been eligible to be released in a few months. In Columbus, Ohio, they wore masks reading “20K by May,” the number of releases they were demanding. A team based at U.C.L.A.’s law school started a spreadsheet to track such actions, calling itself the Covid-19 Behind Bars Data Project. By mid-May, it had tallied more than five hundred legal filings and court orders, along with dozens of protests.

Some efforts accomplished in weeks or months what activists had been working toward for decades, leading to large experiments in decarceration. Since mid-March, San Francisco has reduced its jail population by nearly forty per cent, and California has made plans to release thousands of people from state prisons. In New Jersey, the State Supreme Court authorized the release of as many as a thousand detainees from county jails. Each week in April, the federal-prison population declined by around a thousand people; by May, it had reached its lowest level in two decades. In dozens of cities, cops were ordered to make fewer arrests, district attorneys dropped low-level charges, and judges vacated bench warrants for unpaid fines and other minor infractions. “Advocates on the ground have been challenging mass incarceration for so long—and now much of what we’ve been calling for, pre-COVID-19, we’re seeing it transpire,” Patrisse Cullors, the co-founder of Black Lives Matter, told me, from Los Angeles, where she’s been organizing for releases with Reform L.A. Jails. “At the local, state, and national level, this is a moment when we can collectively transform how our country relates to the most vulnerable.”

One early push occurred in Santa Clara County, California, where the country’s first coronavirus deaths were recorded. Raj Jayadev runs Silicon Valley De-Bug, a grassroots group that helps incarcerated people devise creative strategies to fight their cases. Some eighty per cent of people in the county jail are awaiting trial, often because they can’t afford bail. At weekly De-Bug meetings, families put together “social biography packets,” stuffed with personal photos, letters, and eight-to-ten-minute videos, to present a fuller picture of defendants. In mid-March, as the virus spread, Jayadev worked with Carson White, an attorney with the public defender’s office, who compiled a list of people seeking release from the county jail. White negotiated with prosecutors, the sheriff’s office, and pretrial services, and an agreement was reached to shrink the jail’s population by twenty per cent. On March 19th, the county released an initial group of about a hundred and fifty people. Since then, the jail’s population has been reduced by more than a thousand. “This moment has flipped the script on mass incarceration,” White told me. “It’s laid bare that caging huge swaths of our society isn’t necessary—it’s just convenient.”",100,High,Left,USA,1

Michigan is the tenth-largest state by population, but it has the third-largest number of deaths resulting from COVID-19. The state’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, enacted some of the country’s most stringent stay-at-home orders, even forbidding landscaping and fishing. Furious, and sometimes armed, protesters in Michigan made national news. Meanwhile, Whitmer’s outspoken criticism of the Trump Administration’s efforts on behalf of the states made her a frequent target of the President. “I didn’t ask to be thrown into the national spotlight,” Whitmer tells Susan B. Glasser. “I’m just trying to do my job, and I’m never going to apologize for that. Because lives are at stake here.” Whitmer’s national visibility has brought forward rumors that she is on the short list for Joe Biden’s Vice-Presidential pick. Whitmer is a sexual-assault survivor, and she explains why she stands by Biden despite an accusation made by his former aide Tara Reade.

Glasser also speaks with David Remnick about the tensions that have emerged between the federal government and the states. Although mostly he has targeted Democratic governors, Trump has also criticized some in his own party.",100,High,Left,USA,1

It stood in a small clearing just off a muddy road: one room that contained almost all a writer needed then—a scratched table in front of a window, a rocking chair beside a fireplace, a bookcase, a dictionary, a thesaurus, a teakettle. I’d arrived at the MacDowell Colony, an artists’ residency in Peterborough, New Hampshire, which had been supporting writers, composers, painters, and sculptors since 1906. That winter, there were about fifteen of us in cabins scattered through the woods. We could visit each other—the kettle came with two cups—but not without an expressed invitation. Solitude had its rules. Most days, I kept to myself.

Each evening, I walked half a mile to our communal dinner, the quiet magnifying every sound: the door shutting behind me, my footfalls crunching on the frozen road. One of the things I loved was the sense of safety I felt in the darkening woods. I kept track of the moon. I scanned the sky for Venus and the first glimmerings of Orion. Often, my work still filled my head and, as I emerged from the pines into the open field and saw the bright lights of the dining room in the distance, I felt as if I had to break through a pane of glass to join in. Even so, I loved the intimacy of that meal with others. I’d quickly learned to identify one novelist’s laugh, and to expect a certain painter’s smell of woodsmoke. We gossiped and swapped stories, etching rumor into myth: the woman who had chained herself to her desk in a desperate attempt to stay, a man who fled the quiet—or maybe the trees? Looking back now, I marvel at how quickly a feeling of community took hold, abetted, I’m guessing, by our common purpose, our separateness from our usual lives, and the solitude of our days.

Residencies like MacDowell are often described as “retreats,” which implies a welcome escape from life, or a withdrawal. But those six weeks meant far more to me. I was in my early thirties, and just beginning my serious attempts at writing, working in snatched time in the hours before my day jobs in bookstores and commercial kitchens. The quiet and solitude of my time at MacDowell was an inquiry into a life I wanted to lead, and a challenge. What was I going to do with all that time and space? Since then, in many ways, I’ve sought to build my life around the possibilities I discovered in that cabin, to carve out a world for thought, spending most of each day working in a quiet I built for myself. I came to feel at home in my solitude, having made peace with the way it isn’t predictably stable—with how I’d sometimes slip into it easily, at other times pacing in it, stalked by a restlessness that took effort to shake. I could anticipate its changing textures: the welcome intensity of it after coming home from a day of obligations, its starkness after the departure of a friend.

I live in a modest-sized Maine town and, when our library closed, back in mid-March, I began to isolate myself in earnest. At first, daily life didn’t feel all that different to me. The outside world was just a little quieter, muffled as though it were a Sunday in deep winter. I settled into work as usual, and even welcomed the greater stillness, which seemed to enlarge the sense of spaciousness in my home. But as the pandemic unfolded, and the days became more and more freighted with the unknown, the solitude I’d worked so long to establish began to feel threatened by something I can’t quite name. I began to realize just how much my solitude had existed within a larger web that I could see and hear and feel. Now, as I go through the familiar motions of routine in an altered world, I find myself conscious of absences, especially of the sounds that filtered in behind me as I worked—morning traffic, neighbors walking their dogs, children chattering on their way to the school at the end of the street—which marked the patterns of other people’s days, and defined my life, too.

This new solitude feels lean and hard. As I move deeper into it, I worry that it will replace all the subtle textures of the solitude into which I’ve grown over the last thirty years. And, hard as it is, I’m not sure where its borders lie. What is prudent and what is foolish. What must be endured, what can’t be endured. When it might end. Back in late March, once the snow melted away, I put out two lawn chairs, six feet apart, thinking that I’d have a friend over now and again; they could bring their own tea in a thermos, I thought, or a beer. But after a few weeks, as the daffodils began to show a little color, that didn’t seem like such a good idea. So, I closed up the gap in the chairs, just to look out on something resembling the normal spring in my yard. Several days ago, dreaming of change, I spaced them apart again.

Before I went to MacDowell, my hopes about writing felt like a secret. I’d published a handful of poems in literary journals; if I’d stopped writing, few would have cared, and my parents would have been relieved. I was living outside of Boston with housemates, I was scrambling just to pay the rent. My dream of solitude was a simple one, naïve: I just wanted to be left alone to write. To have the time. In the quiet and space of that cabin in the woods, I got a glimpse of what a writing life would ask of me. As the days went on, I began feeling more ambitious for my work. I had time to try new ideas, to make mistakes and muddle things up. I spent untold hours nosing around, guessing, reading, trying to discern shape, making peace with waste and second thoughts. I’m not sure anymore how much I actually accomplished—it would take another four or five years for me to finish my first book—but I still remember the tenor of those hours, all my own. The spare space grew increasingly intimate and personal, even though I had brought so little with me: a bag of clothes, a box of books, a radio, my typewriter. I can still hear the tapping, and feel the pressure of my fingers on its keys. When I struggled with restlessness, I walked in the woods or turned on the radio and let unfamiliar voices in.

That world quickly came to feel like my real life, and on the last day of my residency, as I slowly packed up my things, returning the studio to its blank possibility, I was stunned by how quickly all sense of my presence dissipated. Driving home, spring advanced as I made my way south. Winter trees reddened; moss was bright on the stone walls. It was as though, in less than two hours, I had travelled through an entire season, and the world I returned to seemed cluttered with what I’d left behind. I certainly wasn’t much good in the kitchen on my first days back at work, and I knew the few hours I had to write were no longer going to be enough.",100,High,Left,USA,1
