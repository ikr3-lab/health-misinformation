J.B. Pritzker to roll back his executive stay-at-home order.

The Illinois Department of Public Health also said an additional 2,088 people have tested positive for COVID-19, raising the statewide case tally to 92,457. The death toll stands at 4,129.

And for the third straight day, the Northeast region of the state met the medical criteria set by Pritzker’s administration to advance to the third phase of his reopening plan when his stay-at-home expires at the end of the month. That would mean many non-essential businesses including salons and barbershops could reopen with health precautions in place.

Those Phase 3 reopening requirements include holding the coronavirus testing positivity rate under 20% for two weeks. The Northeast region, which includes Chicago and the collar counties, was at 18.8% Saturday.

The state received 23,047 test results Friday, and more than 561,000 tests have been administered overall. Pritzker has highlighted testing capacity as another key factor in reopening, with several new testing sites opening this weekend.

But even as plans are laid to gear the economy into motion, the governor’s office has said the peak of the pandemic could extend well into the summer.

The virus has been confirmed in all but two Illinois counties, while Cook County is registering the most confirmed cases of any county in the nation. More than 1,800 coronavirus deaths have been reported in the state this month alone.

Reopen Illinois protesters rally again

Despite the grim figures, a vocal contingent of demonstrators rallied again outside the Thompson Center in the Loop and the State Capitol Building in Springfield demanding Pritzker reopen the state immediately.

With a roster of conservative speakers including radio host Erich “Mancow” Muller, people in the crowd chanted “Right to go to church” and toted signs declaring “Jesus is my vaccine,” a day before a handful of churches planned to hold services in defiance of Pritzker’s stay-at-home order, which bars gatherings of more than 10 people.

Other signs declared “Freedom is essential” and suggested Pritzker’s extended stay-at-home order is part of a political scheme to subvert President Donald Trump’s reelection effort.

“They said this was all about flattening the curve. I think we flattened the curve,” Illinois Republican Party Chairman Tim Schneider said. “These are the snarky things he says: ‘This is all about science... and the peak isn’t going to hit until the middle of June.’ Why did they take down all the beds in McCormick Place already then?

“You know what this is all about. This is about taking down President Trump in November,” Schneider said.

A concurrent protest was held outside the State Capitol in Springfield.

Connie Unger, one of the several protesters at the downstate rally who carried a “Fire Pritzker” sign, said the Democratic governor has “overstepped his boundaries” with his stay-at-home orders.

“He is against our state, he has another motive and I don’t believe that he is a true patriot,” Unger said. “His motive is to be the most liberal governor so that he can run for a higher office.”

At both protests, a few signs were spotted comparing Pritzker, who is Jewish, to Adolf Hitler. A handful of similar anti-Semitic signs were seen at the first major Reopen Illinois rallies held May 1, drawing condemnation from the Auschwitz‑Birkenau Memorial and State Museum.

Pritzker has said most Illinoisans have been following his guidelines, and has framed the protesters as “outliers.”

“Today, as millions of Illinoisans followed the public health guidance in place to keep everyone safe, a loud minority gathered in an attempt to get headlines for their hateful, ignorant, anti-Semitic protest against science,” Pritzker spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh said in an email. “We know the majority of Illinoisans who remain vigilant in this fight against COVID-19 are the reason we’re flattening the curve and those gathering in defiance of the medical experts have them to thank for their health and safety.”

7:20 p.m. Obama criticizes U.S. leaders’ virus response in online graduation speech

WASHINGTON — Former President Barack Obama on Saturday criticized U.S. leaders overseeing the nation’s response to the coronavirus, telling college graduates in an online commencement address that the pandemic shows many officials “aren’t even pretending to be in charge.”

Obama spoke on “Show Me Your Walk, HBCU Edition,” a two-hour event for students graduating from historically black colleges and universities broadcast on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. His remarks were unexpectedly political, given the venue, and touched on current events beyond the virus and its social and economic impacts.

“More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they’re doing,” Obama said. “A lot them aren’t even pretending to be in charge.”

5:55 p.m. Bittersweet e-ceremony for UIC grad: ‘I didn’t really get to say goodbye’

Edith Mendez watched a slideshow of photos from her college experience, read a Spanish quote she handpicked to thank her family and listened to a speech delivered by her college dean Saturday.

But the 2020 graduate from the University of Illinois at Chicago did so from the backyard of her family’s Berwyn home, not on campus with the momentous ceremony she’d always imagined.

“It was a little bit strange — maybe, in some ways, disappointing,” said Mendez, a first-generation college grad. “Just because I didn’t get to walk across the stage.”

She joined more than 5,000 UIC students — and tens of thousands more at other Illinois schools — left with no choice but to celebrate their graduation with an online ceremony in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.

UIC still plans to hold an in-person commencement for their 2020 class sometime later this year, but with the state’s stay-at-home order banning large gatherings, the virtual stand-in will have to do for now.

4:38 p.m. ‘Steady decrease’ in coronavirus cases at Cook County Jail, officials say

Fewer people have tested positive for the coronavirus over the past month at Cook County Jail, officials announced Friday.

The rate of positive COVID-19 tests has gone from 97% to less than 10% since March, Cook County Health officials said in a statement.

Since May 8, most of the new cases have come from detainees entering the jail, rather than people who were already in custody, officials said.

They credited the decline to interventions implemented since the beginning of the year, including opening unused divisions to accommodate social distancing, converting available cells to single-occupancy and enhanced testing.

2:09 p.m. Nurse says she regrets going to packed Wisconsin bar without mask

A nurse says she regrets not taking better safety precautions after she was criticized this week for appearing without a mask in a local television interview at a packed Wisconsin bar.

Katie Koutsky, a nurse with the Downers Grove-based Advocate Aurora Health system, says she was helping her sister reopen her suburban Milwaukee bar Wednesday evening when the news crew approached her.

“I have a toddler at home and I’m a full-time nurse, so it’s been very stressful and hard to not be able to go out and be with my friends and family at the bars,” Koutsky said in an interview aired by Milwaukee station WTMJ-TV.

Asked if she was worried about getting the virus from being in a bar without social distancing, she said, “No, I don’t think that the risk presents any higher than me going to a grocery store.”

11:43 a.m. Coronavirus masks a boon for crooks who hide their faces

The way the FBI tells it, William Rosario Lopez put on a surgical mask and walked into the Connecticut convenience store looking to the world like a typical pandemic-era shopper as he picked up plastic wrap, fruit snacks and a few other items. Then, when the only other customer left, he went to the counter, pulled out a small pistol, pointed it at the clerk and demanded that he open the cash register.

The scene, the FBI contends in a court document, was repeated by Lopez in four other gas station stores over eight days before his April 9 arrest. It underscores a troubling new reality for law enforcement: Masks that have made criminals stand apart long before bandanna-wearing robbers knocked over stagecoaches in the Old West and ski-masked bandits held up banks now allow them to blend in like concerned accountants, nurses and store clerks trying to avoid a deadly virus.

“Criminals, they’re smart and this is a perfect opportunity for them to conceal themselves and blend right in,” said Richard Bell, police chief in the tiny Pennsylvania community of Frackville. He said he knows of seven recent armed robberies in the region where every suspect wore a mask.

Across the United States, masks have become more and more prevalent, first as a voluntary precaution and then as a requirement imposed by governmental agencies and businesses. And people with masks — as well as latex gloves — have found their way into more and more crime reports.

Just how many criminals are taking advantage of the pandemic to commit crimes is impossible to estimate, but law enforcement officials have no doubt the numbers are climbing.

11:17 a.m. ‘Everyone has a story’: How will world remember pandemic?

Artist Obi Uwakwe was driving through Chicago’s empty streets, camera on his lap to document life during COVID-19, when he saw something that made him stop: a casket being carried out of a church while a few mourners stood by, their faces covered.

The 43-year-old raised his camera and took a photograph. Later, it would become one of the images Uwakwe used to create paintings inspired by the pandemic.

“To see maybe six people there, everyone wearing a mask,” he said, “it brought everything together.”

Around the world, people like Uwakwe are creating photographs, paintings, emails, journals and social media posts that will shape how the world remembers the coronavirus pandemic for years and centuries to come. Museums and historical societies already are collecting materials, often with help from people accustomed to capturing and sharing even the most mundane moments around them.

The result, historians say, will be a collective memory more personal than perhaps any other moment in history.

10:46 a.m. Democrats push new $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill through House

Democrats powered a massive $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill through the House on Friday, an election-year measure designed to brace a U.S. economy in free fall and a health care system struggling to contain a pandemic still pummeling the country.

The 208-199 vote, with all but one Republican opposed, advances what boils down to a campaign-season display of Democratic economic and health-care priorities. It has no chance of becoming law as written, but will likely spark difficult negotiations with the White House and Senate Republicans. Any product would probably be the last major COVID-19 response bill before November’s presidential and congressional elections.

The enormous Democratic measure would cost more than the prior four coronavirus bills combined. It would deliver almost $1 trillion for state and local governments, another round of $1,200 direct payments to individuals and help for the unemployed, renters and homeowners, college debt holders and the struggling Postal Service.

“Not to act now is not only irresponsible in a humanitarian way, it is irresponsible because it’s only going to cost more,” warned House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. “More in terms of lives, livelihood, cost to the budget, cost to our democracy.”

10:00 a.m. Illinois nears 2,000 nursing home deaths as coronavirus continues to spread

Illinois is nearing 2,000 coronavirus deaths at long-term care facilities as new, confirmed cases continue to roll in at hundreds of nursing homes impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

State totals now stand at 1,975 deaths and 13,218 confirmed cases in nursing homes, according to a count by the Chicago Sun-Times. Long-term care facilities account for 48.7% of all coronavirus deaths in Illinois, records show.

The state’s long-term care facilities reported 455 new deaths and 2,405 new cases this week, according to data released Friday by state health officials.

New deaths were reported at 180 facilities this week, and 259 homes said they had at least one new confirmed case.

A total of 86 homes have seen double-digit deaths tallies, up from 50 last week. There are now 27 facilities reporting at least 100 confirmed cases.

9:04 a.m. Last fans standing: Recounting the Sharks-Blackhawks game on March 11, the last game in town before sports shut down

Brandon Saad cut to the front of the net, took a pass and scored through Aaron Dell’s legs in the second period to give the Blackhawks a 3-1 lead over the Sharks.

It was 8:34 p.m. on March 11.

He celebrated in characteristic fashion, with a yell and double fist-pump, as “Chelsea Dagger” blared.

He had no way of knowing — Hawks teammates would say later they didn’t receive any outside information at either intermission — that the world in which he scored his 21st goal of the season was quickly looking a lot different than the world in which he scored his first 20.

Unlike other disasters of this generation, the coronavirus pandemic did not arrive in an instant. John Lennon’s 1980 death stunned a live television audience on ABC’s “Monday Night Football”; Osama Bin Laden’s 2011 death earned an announcement during an MLB game on ESPN. The emergence of COVID-19 was not nearly as sudden or surprising in any given moment.

But if the pandemic did have a specific arrival point, it was the night of March 11.

In a span of roughly two hours, the NBA went from postponing a game due to a player — Jazz center Rudy Gobert — testing positive for the virus to indefinitely suspending the season.

President Donald Trump announced an unprecedented European travel ban. Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson became the first American celebrities to test positive. The ill-fated 2020 NCAA Tournament announced it would play without fans.

And during those same two hours, the Hawks and Sharks played a regular-season NHL game like nothing was happening at all.

We take a look back — through the eye of fans — at the last major sports event in Chicago.

7:00 a.m. DePaul, Loyola releases plans for fall semester

As coronavirus cases continue to increase statewide, two Chicago universities are planning to have students on campus this fall.

DePaul University and Loyola University of Chicago have consulted with public health experts and state and local officials to devise their plans for the fall semester.

DePaul expects to have limited in-person learning and reduced occupancy in the dorms this fall. Meanwhile, Loyola hopes to offer both on-campus and online classes.

Both universities said they’ll share more details about the fall semester in the coming weeks.

Loyola also announced its “Loyola Commitment,” a new financial aid program, funded by the university and its donors, which will help students who have been affected by the economic downturn amid the pandemic.

“As unemployment rises along with uncertainty about our economic outlook, we will see a sharp increase in students and families whose plans about attending Loyola might be hindered. Dreams are being crushed by diminished family finances,” Loyola provost Norberto Grzywacz wrote in an email to students. “The scale of this crisis and its financial impact on families will have a profound effect on many students from various backgrounds. In particular, it is expected to impact enrollment and our desire for a vibrant and diverse community as a place of growth, experience, and opportunity.”

Analysis & Commentary

12:33 p.m. COVID-19 scales back youth sports. That’s a win for many kids

My heart will break for older teens if they don’t get to play sports in Illinois this summer, or maybe this fall, because of the coronavirus. Most are nearing the end of their competitive sports days, and you hate to see them robbed.

For younger kids, I see a silver lining. It’s a chance for them to do more bike riding. They can learn to rollerblade or skateboard. Maybe they can join their parents for runs or walks.

They could get a much-needed break from an over-scheduled life, especially when it comes to sports.

Or, maybe not. In Missouri, a 40-team youth baseball tournament was held last weekend by GameTime Tournaments. You won’t see this in Illinois right now because of the stay-at-home order to curb the spread of the virus. But, at least one Illinois team, the Black Sox from central Illinois, made the trip, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

GameTime instituted social distancing guidelines, including no high-fives, and sanitized the ball often. But some things can’t be helped in baseball: The catcher always will be positioned behind the batter. Players bump into each other on some plays. Out of habit, coaches are bound to get close to players to give instruction.

After being at home for weeks, the games had to be a relief for the players and parents who watched. But 40 teams? That’s downright irresponsible, even if permissible by Missouri’s looser restrictions related to the virus.

Fewer games, or no games for a year, could be a very good thing for kids.

7:00 a.m. Everything must be on the table as city, state fight back from financial devastation

Washington to cities and states: You’re on your own.

For months, the Trump administration has failed to take the lead in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, punting responsibility to the states. Now the president and his Republican Party are looking to do the same when it comes to helping states and cities survive the pandemic’s financial devastation.

A $3 trillion stimulus package expected to be approved by the Democratic-controlled House looks dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate, and President Donald Trump is making clear he would never sign such a bill.

Why? Because the package to rescue drowning cities, suburbs, states, small businesses and unemployed Americans would be fiscally imprudent, they claim.

We couldn’t disagree more. And, yes, this is the same Senate and president who rewrote the federal tax code in 2017 to give billions of dollars in tax cuts to the wealthiest one percent of Americans, ballooning the federal deficit.

So what does all this mean for Illinois and Chicago, as well as for towns and counties statewide?

But if the pandemic did have a specific arrival point, it was the night of March 11.

In a span of roughly two hours, the NBA went from postponing a game due to a player — Jazz center Rudy Gobert — testing positive for the virus to indefinitely suspending the season.

President Donald Trump announced an unprecedented European travel ban. Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson became the first American celebrities to test positive. The ill-fated 2020 NCAA Tournament announced it would play without fans.

And during those same two hours, the Hawks and Sharks played a regular-season NHL game like nothing was happening at all.

As far as the participants in the game knew, nothing was happening.

But the 21,275 fans who packed the United Center that night knew. What began as another typical game day became a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The fans learned the scope of a crisis that ultimately would ban crowds and sports while in a crowd watching sports.

“In the morning, it was not a big deal,” said Andrew Cameron, a student at Joliet Junior College, who was in attendance. “The next day, it was the biggest deal on the planet.”

This month, the Sun-Times interviewed 18 of the fans lucky — or unlucky — enough to be at the game that night.

They sat in the 100 and 300 levels and in suites and boxes. Some are season-ticket holders. Others were attending their first Hawks game of the season, or ever. Many were Chicagoans, but others traveled from Edmonton or northern Wisconsin to attend the game.

Together, they experienced perhaps the strangest Hawks game in history.

Daytime

Susan Leibforth received the text from her sons, both Hawks season-ticket holders, a few days in advance: Would she and her husband, Bill, want their tickets for the Sharks game?

For Bill, in his mid-70s, the answer was no. He already had heard of the health risks of the virus and decided going to a large public gathering wasn’t worth it.

So Leibforth invited her two granddaughters and one of their friends instead.

“I decided I was just going to be very careful,” she said. “I talked to the girls before we went and said, ‘Try not to touch the rails,’ and all the things that were new to us then. And I gave them each a little hand sanitizer.”

Patrick Dennis and his girlfriend, Sarah, then Illinois State seniors, also were sharing hand sanitizer and developing a healthy game plan while driving up Interstate 55.

Months before, Dennis had decided between the Hawks’ March 11 game against the Sharks and the March 13 game against the Senators for a late birthday present, given that both games aligned with his spring break.

He eventually picked the Sharks matchup, a Wednesday night, because of his wariness of Friday traffic in Chicago. It was to be his third NHL game.

“The thought crossed my mind as I was driving up,” Dennis said. “I made my girlfriend hand-sanitize everything, don’t touch your face when we’re in the United Center, don’t get too close to other people if we can — which is kind of a fool’s errand when you’re at a professional sports event.”

As Leibforth and Dennis drove in, Bob Bednarz — a season-ticket holder in Section 331 — sat at dinner with two friends, one a nurse.

“I was asking them, as people in the medical field, ‘What is your opinion [about COVID-19]?’ ” Bednarz said. “And they were like, ‘It’s bad, but as long as you keep good hygiene, you wash your hands and you don’t do anything crazy, it shouldn’t affect your day-to-day life.’ ”

After that dinner conversation, Bednarz went to the United Center reassured, expecting little to come from the coronavirus.

Tracy McGrath, exuberant about receiving last-minute tickets from her boss, felt the same as she waited in security with her boyfriend.

“He did [feel hesitation] and kept bringing it up, and I kept saying, ‘You’re crazy, we’re fine. Just stop. Nothing’s going to happen. It’s fine,’ ” McGrath said. “At the time, I didn’t really grasp it.”

While waiting, she received an email: Her office was closing. She wasn’t to come in Thursday, denying her a chance to thank her boss in person. It was stunning news, but it was just the beginning of a very busy night for her phone.

Meanwhile, inside the arena, Section 333 season-ticket holder Erin Berry ran into her Hawks sales representative and wasn’t quite sure how to behave.

“We joked, ‘Do we shake hands? Do we not shake hands? Is that still allowed?’ ” Berry said, laughing. “I can remember us making a joke about that, and I was like, ‘I literally just washed my hands, it’s fine.’ We shook hands, and I was like, ‘That was still kind of weird.’ ”

Puck drop

The United Center was officially sold out again, marking the building’s 531st consecutive sellout.

But it was a late-arriving crowd, partially because of the early start — 7 instead of 7:30 p.m. because it was NBC Sports Network’s Wednesday night national game — and partially because of the coronavirus.

Cary Jacobs, another longtime season-ticket holder, noticed the difference in his section.

“In fact, there were a lot of people that did not go to that game,” Jacobs said. “The two aisle seats were empty, and at least four of the seats on the other side of me were empty. And then there’s another group in the row in front of me where there’s five or six season-ticket holders ... and only one of them was there.”

That had a big impact on the supply-demand curve in the resale market, which already had been ugly for 2019-20 Hawks tickets because of the team’s struggles.

“Just for kicks, I decided to go online to look at what the ticket prices were at that time, and you could get a ticket basically where we were sitting for $4,” Dennis said. “We had paid $60 for them, and my girlfriend was not terribly happy to hear that.”

Yet the arena eventually filled up, with only slightly more empty seats than usual scattered around during the first period, which ended with a 1-0 Sharks lead.

Then at 8:04, as the second period began, the first domino — in what would become a transformative night for the nation — fell.

“I happened to be checking out my phone on Reddit, and just from looking around there, the first thing I saw happened to be the [Europe] travel ban,” Dennis said. “I turned to my girlfriend, and I was like, ‘Holy crap, this is really getting serious.’ ”

In the plush BMO Harris Club, where Silvia Hernandez was attending her first hockey game with a business group, there was significantly more alarm.

“At that time, we had coworkers — one in Malta, one in the U.K.,” Hernandez said. “We were like, ‘Oh, no. They have to get on the first flight back.’ We were just panicking during the game to figure out what they were going to do.”

At 8:06, Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson released a statement about their positive diagnosis. That revelation brought far less direct impact to Hawks fans than the travel ban but arguably even more sentimentality.

“Once Tom Hanks had it, I was like, ‘Oh, anybody can get it,’ ” Hernandez said.

Doomsday

Eight hundred miles southwest, the Thunder-Jazz NBA game had been called off relatively early. It became official at 7:40. The sports world already was paying close attention to the developing situation there.

Several Hawks fans, including Section 306 season-ticket holder Matt Lavieri, mentioned they were among those watching for news out of Oklahoma City.

When the bombshells dropped, they dropped fast and hard.

At 8:27, Gobert tested positive. At 8:30, Patrick Kane gave the Hawks a 2-1 lead. At 8:31, the NBA halted its season. At 8:34, Saad scored.

“I clicked on [an Adrian Wojnarowski tweet], and I thought it was just going to be a trade or something,” Cameron said. “And the tweet says, ‘NBA season suspended.’ And I was just like, ‘Oh, my god.’

“A few seconds after that, Saad scores, and we just sit down and mull over it and think, ‘Is that real? The NBA season is suspended because of coronavirus?’ ”

Across the upper bowl, McGrath’s cellphone erupted with 10 times as much buzzing as when her work closed.

“My phone started blowing up during the game, from Twitter to Facebook to my friends texting me going, ‘Are you OK? What’s happening? Are you leaving the game?’ ” McGrath said.

“You go into it not thinking about anything but the game. But then when my phone starts blowing up and everybody around you is looking at you like you’re crazy, then it starts to hit you that there’s all this happening, and it’s bigger than sports, and it’s bigger than what’s happening right there in that moment.”

The news reverberated through the arena even faster than any contagious disease possibly could.

“It was kind of a ripple,” Dennis said. “You overheard somebody talking about it and thought, ‘There’s no way that’s actually true.’ And you check your phone, and it’s, ‘Oh, crap, it’s actually true.’ ”

“The arena was like up, down, up, down,” said Gary Winthrope, who got free tickets in Section 109 from a hesitant friend. “Everybody was looking at their phone, then looking at the game.”

“It was a little bit surreal where you’re kind of in two places at once,” Bednarz said. “You’re in this environment where everything seems great and you’re celebrating, but at the same time, you’re like, ‘Oh, crap, what’s going to happen?’ ”

At the time, no one in the arena knew if the game would be finished or if the slate of West Coast NHL games scheduled later that night would be played.

On the TV broadcast, NBCSN commentators Mike Emrick and Eddie Olczyk made no mention of the elephant in the room until the second period ended, when they teased a “major NBA announcement” to be discussed during intermission. Minutes later, Darren Dreger reported that the NHL was crafting a statement.

Finally, at 9:12, the league announced it would defer its decision — which turned out to mirror the NBA’s — to the next day. The Hawks game, already in the third period by then, would finish normally.

That didn’t mean the atmosphere went back to normal, though.

Aftermath

Dominik Kubalik added a cherry onto the Hawks’ dominant 6-2 win with a rocketing slap shot in the final minutes, making him the only rookie to reach the 30-goal mark so far this season.

But many fans already had left by then, either because of the blowout or the pandemic. And those who remained didn’t want to touch each other, making the goal more awkward than celebratory.

“Blackhawks fans, we’re a family. Everybody talks and high-fives after a goal,” Winthrope said. “And after Kubalik’s goal, everyone stood up, but no one was high-fiving. It wasn’t like what it usually is.”

“It was maybe [half] of the people, but a quarter of the reaction,” Dennis said. “It was less of a get-up-and-scream and more of a ‘Yay, maybe this will end soon.’ Because I really do think people were scared.”

“It was a win, but it almost didn’t feel like it,” Lavieri said. “It almost felt like we lost.”

At the final horn, many of those who remained took pictures of the emptying arena or the “Blackhawks Win!” message on the scoreboard, seemingly aware they wouldn’t see either sight again for quite a while.

Indeed, most of the fans interviewed said they felt certain at that point that the NHL soon would pause its own season, or at least switch to holding all games without fans.

“All the conversations I could hear — and the conversation I was having with the person in front of me — were all like, ‘OK, this is probably it for the year,’ ” Jacobs said. “When the game ended, everybody was like, ‘See you next season.’ Once that [NBA] story came out, everybody got the feeling that we wouldn’t be back.”

For those already in the concourses, it was a mad dash to the safety and seclusion of their cars. There was little milling around, socializing or even self-relieving.

“I saw almost nobody in the bathroom after the game because I get the feeling people didn’t want to go somewhere like a public restroom that was so possibly highly contaminated,” Cameron said.

“It’s a postgame tradition for me, no matter who I go with, to walk to the atrium and browse the store and look at the jerseys,” said Justin Ligeski, who attended the game with Cameron. “That was the first time the switch flipped in my head: ‘I can’t do that. I need to go home.’ ”

Bobby Ziegler had it even worse. He’d bought with friends a monthly plan that gave them standing-room tickets to all 11 scheduled Hawks home games in March. But he realized that night they wouldn’t be seeing the final seven.

Plus, he’d ridden the El to the game — a decision he greatly regretted in retrospect.

“I took the Green Line down, and going home, I was very cognizant not to touch anything,” Ziegler said. “I remember my son saying that, in New York, they were already starting to shut the subway down. I was worried if I was going to have to walk home. It was that crazy.”

In the locker room, the Hawks were just starting to find out all that they’d missed.

The NHL had implemented a closed-room policy two days before in response to the coronavirus’ spread, so a shell-shocked Patrick Kane, Duncan Keith and coach Jeremy Colliton were instead escorted one by one to talk to the media.

“I didn’t know anything until just now, seeing it on the TV,” Keith said. “It makes you wonder what’s going to happen, and it really could be something where we’re doing the same thing [as the NBA].”

“I guess things are getting pretty real around here,” Kane added with a nervous chuckle.

Looking back

Monday marked two months since the March 11 Sharks-Hawks game and the night that flipped 2020 on its head.

There hasn’t been any hockey since, and the AHL — fittingly, though coincidentally — commemorated the anniversary by canceling the rest of its season.

The NHL reportedly continues to evaluate dozens of potential resumption scenarios, but none would begin anytime soon and none would involve fans in the building. The United Center, after all, is filled with thousands of pounds of food and couldn’t host a hockey game if it tried.

Many Chicagoans even might be struggling to remember what pre-coronavirus life was like — or how nice it was to have numerous live sporting events to consider attending or watching every night.

But the 21,275 who chose to take in the last game they possibly could have aren’t having any trouble remembering that experience now. They might not forget it for the rest of their lives.

“It’s one of those things where you look back and you’re like, ‘Wow, that could’ve been super risky,’ ” Bednarz said. “Who knows how many people — at the game even — had [coronavirus] or caught it. But what are you going to do about that? It’s crazy to think about.”

“The historical impact that it’ll have for me are just the feelings I had, sitting in that seat, throughout the whole third period,” Ligeski said. “ ‘What am I going to do after this game? What is life going to be like?’ ”

“It’s definitely going to be a ‘Where were you?’ moment,” Winthrope said. “Like a ‘Where were you when O.J. was [acquitted]?’ kind of thing. And now, ‘Where were you when coronavirus hit big?’ I was at a sold-out United Center watching the Blackhawks play. And that’s just so weird to me.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Amid the global pandemic, we were forced shortly after spring break from in-person classes to meeting on Zoom.

It seemed a relevant undertaking for students tasked mainly with writing about the world through the third-person objective observer lens. The assignment: Write a first-person essay on the impact of the pandemic upon their lives. Here are some of their reflections, which will be publicly podcasted soon:

Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.

Dylan Jeninga, a sophomore, writes, “There are invisible people, everyone knows that. They work hard to get us to notice them, but too often, we don’t. We walk by and hope they don’t talk to us.

“One such person lives, or did live, on the corner of Broadway and Granville, near my apartment. I don’t know her name. But she’s been there as long as I’ve lived in the neighborhood, wrapped in too many coats, selling Streetwise magazines.

“Once, when I worked at (a store) down the street, we got into a shouting match because she was spending too long in our bathroom, and my boss told me to kick her out. Ever since, I’ve avoided her. I walk right past without even looking at her.

“Of course, I haven’t done that much since the COVID-19 outbreak locked the city down. I’ve been sheltering in place... Even so, she’s been there, selling her magazines, her worldly belongings piled into a rusty cart behind her…

“.. .We may never know the full cost of the pandemic. But I do know that the woman has disappeared. ... All I can think about are all the times I walked by and tried not to look at her.”

Grace Koeppen, a sophomore integrated marketing communications major, writes: “It’s 7:30 a.m, and typically I’d be refreshed and ready to start my morning on campus. Instead I’m quarantined at home, groggy, with my laptop at my feet, holding 13 unread emails, four assignments due, and a Zoom meeting scheduled for two hours from now.

“This pandemic has misplaced me from everything that appeared normal … Working from home is hard.”

Daniel Itonyo, a senior economics major, writes: “To be honest, I’m not even sure what day it is. The coronavirus pandemic struck the world to a halt. ... The tragedy of this outbreak hits more closely when you realize that most of the deaths are within your community, the African American community.

“ … We all play a vital role, You and I, need to first of all acknowledge that it is easy to be ‘woke’ [or aware] but still fail to truly understand the urgency of the issues of racial disparity because we don’t live it and are blinded by our privileges.”

Lewis Rawlinson, a graduating musical arts major and cellist, writes, “New York City has begun mass burial for unaccounted for COVID-19 patients on Hart Island off the coast of the Bronx, the same site that was used to bury people who died of AIDS by the thousands. Those people also died alone in quarantine—one forged by stigma and bigotry.

“Those lost to the AIDS epidemic and those living with HIV today deserve respect and truth.

“During the early stages of their epidemic, there was no talk of flattening the curve. There was no emergency relief bill for resources and economic support. The government failed them and resulted in more graves that had to be dug, and it was because they were queer. That must never be forgotten.”

The same be said of the lessons from this storm. They must not be forgotten.

Shutting down the lakefront. Cutting off citywide liquor sales. Driving around the city to personally break up large gatherings, inspiring a hilarious string of memes that softened her hard edges.

Her self-declared war on poverty made infinitely more difficult in black and Hispanic neighborhoods that have borne the brunt of the layoffs and deaths.

The stay-at-home shutdown of the Chicago economy that will blow a giant hole in her precariously balanced budget. The strike-shortened school year cut even shorter. And a Chicago City Council rebellion that gained steam during the mayor’s 29-to-21 fight for emergency contracting and spending authority.

“If she is able to guide us through this incredibly difficult time and Chicago emerges stronger, she is going to be viewed historically as one of the city’s greatest mayors,” said former Ald. Joe Moore (49th). “But, boy, it is daunting.”

Democratic political consultant Peter Giangreco said the “most important measure of any executive is to show strong leadership” during a crisis, and Lightfoot has “hit that one out of the park.

“She’s got to keep leveling with people,” said Giangreco, who advised Susana Mendoza’s losing mayoral campaign against Lightfoot. “She’s at her best when she’s telling people inconvenient truths.”

Wednesday will mark the one-year anniversary of Lightfoot’s historic inauguration as the first African American female and first openly gay mayor of Chicago.

“It’s been a helluva year,” Lightfoot told the Chicago Sun-Times. “Nobody comes into office thinking they’re gonna have to deal with a pandemic before they even hit their one-year anniversary… It’s been a humbling experience.

“I’m not gonna say that there haven’t been days where I shed a tear. I have. I’ve wept for the loss. I’ve wept for the hardship that so many people are suffering. But I know that they rely upon me to…pick myself up and get back into the fight every single day.”

It seems forever ago that Lightfoot used her inaugural address to portray the city council as corrupt, stripped aldermen of their “prerogative” over licensing and permitting in their wards and used her first council meeting to humiliate now-indicted Ald. Edward Burke (14th).

Since then, Lightfoot has been faced with so many controversies that she jokingly has compared herself to the central character in the bible’s Book of Job.

She erased what she said was an $838 million shortfall — without a massive property tax increase — by balancing her $11.6 billion budget with assumptions and one-time revenues.

During the budget battle, Lightfoot angrily accused ride-hailing giant Uber of “paying off” black ministers with an offer of $54 million to kill her $40 million congestion fee. The unsubstantiated charge offended the ministers, a powerful political force.

After the council vote, the mayor again showed how intolerant she is to dissent. She used her political action committee to shame the 11 aldermen who dared to vote against a budget they said “woefully underfunds” affordable housing and mental health.

Lightfoot also endured an 11-day teachers strike that ended, only after she lost the public relations battle to a machine-like Chicago Teachers Union and essentially gave away the store to the union that backed her vanquished opponent Toni Preckwinkle, the Cook County Board president.

The end came only after Lightfoot removed the line she had stubbornly drawn in the sand by compensating teachers for five of the 11 days they had spent on strike. Still, the six-day pay cut so infuriated CTU leaders that they refused to stand with the mayor when the agreement was announced. Bitterness from that episode still lingers on both sides.

The firing of police Supt. Eddie Johnson was another key moment in Lightfoot’s first year. Even after Johnson was found slumped over the wheel of his police SUV near his Bridgeport home — and told the mayor that happened after he had dinner and drinks with friends — Lightfoot allowed Johnson to announce his own retirement and held a celebratory news conference in his honor.

A few weeks later, a livid Lightfoot fired Johnson after accusing the superintendent she inherited of “lying to me and lying to the public” about the circumstances surrounding the Oct. 17, 2019, incident. She got even with a vengeance, placing Johnson on City Hall’s do-not-hire list.

To David Greising, the Better Government Association’s president and chief executive officer, the ugly firing of one of Chicago’s most popular police superintendents showed Lightfoot “maturing” on the job.

“She went from being doubtful he could do the job to learning she needed to rely on him through the summer, then deciding he wasn’t the person going forward, yet trusting his first version of what happened at the asleep-behind-the-wheel-of-a-parked-car episode to then being lied to and, in a pique, saying more than she needed to about what had gone on there,” Greising said. “It was not her finest hour.”

Garry McCarthy, the former police superintendent-turned-mayoral candidate, doesn’t care about the circuitous path Lightfoot took to get rid of Johnson. What matters to McCarthy is she ended up in the right place.

“You can’t hold police officers accountable for lying and not hold the police chief accountable for the same thing,” he said.

Johnson’s firing hastened the arrival of retired Los Angeles police Chief Charlie Beck, a policing heavyweight lured by Lightfoot’s public safety gravitas.

Beck didn’t just sit there. Taking on the dirty work, he ended merit promotions and engineered a massive police shakeup while running things until the arrival of former Dallas police Chief David Brown.

The manner in which Lightfoot got her choice, in Brown, generated its own controversy. A former Chicago Police Board president whose recommendations were ignored by former Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Lightfoot said the selection process “only has legitimacy if you follow it.”

Lightfoot had her eye on Brown from the moment she fired Johnson. She chose Brown one day after the board made public its list of three finalists and made certain the other two finalists had nowhere near Brown’s experience so that the choice would appear obvious. It was hardly the “transparency” she had promised.

Before returning to Los Angeles, Beck said there were “two pandemics that face Chicago — and only one of them is virus-induced.”

Now, Brown is on the clock to find a solution for the pandemic induced by gangs and gun violence.

“The courts are effectively closed,” Lightfoot said. “The jail is closed. Our federal partners that we rely upon are at home and not doing what they normally do from a criminal justice standpoint. Our Chicago Police Department is standing effectively alone. And guess what? They’re human beings. They’ve been getting sick. Some have died.

“Trying to figure out how you police in this really difficult environment is the challenge of a lifetime. I joked with David Brown the other day. I called and said, ‘I hope you’re not heading back to Dallas.’ ”

The April 11 demolition debacle in Little Village triggered, yet another controversy, this one at the worst possible time.

Armed with a city demolition permit that Ald. Mike Rodriguez (22nd) tried to block, a subcontractor hired by Hilco Redevelopment Partners demolished a 95-year-old smokestack at the site of a shuttered coal-fired power plant without abiding by the safety measures it had promised to implement.

A giant plume of dust rained down on the community, making it difficult to breathe during a coronavirus pandemic that does the same.

Desperate to minimize the political fallout, Lightfoot blamed Hilco, slapped the company with $68,000 in fines and vowed to overhaul the city’s regulatory system. She also denied that her executive order stripping aldermen of control over licensing and permitting had set the stage for the demolition disaster and lashed out at aldermen who said otherwise.

Council members who pushed back against Lightfoot’s request for expanded spending and contracting authority for the duration of the pandemic similarly were denounced as “shameful,” “selfish” grandstanders willing to put politics over public health.

Lightfoot got her way after a 29-to-21 vote not seen since the 1980’s power struggle known as Council Wars that saw 29 aldermen, most of them white, thwart former Mayor Harold Washington’s every move.

But the close vote and thin-skinned prelude to it signals trouble may be ahead when the shutdown ends and painful, budget-balancing decisions begin.

“She is willing to put opponents in their place in order to make a point about the power dynamic between her and her opponent,” Greising said. “Does she do that to make an important point, as she did in her smackdown of Ed Burke? Or does she just do that to kind of show off in a way that’s not constructive?

“If she has unnecessarily dismissed people or embarrassed them or called into question their value as representatives of their wards, has she cost herself in terms of being able to advance her agenda?”

Apparently referring to earlier skirmishes with aldermen over aldermanic prerogative, recreational marijuana and gay setasides, Moore agreed that Lightfoot “has to do a better job of relating to the city council” because her “margin for error is diminishing.

“Clearly, there are lot more socialists and uber-left progressives who are gonna vote against her no matter what because she is adopting a very pragmatic governing style,” he said. “But a few of those 21 votes were — based on my conversations with my former colleagues — just aldermen who feel like they’re being disrespected.

“That would be the one area that…she needs improvement on. But, overall, ironically, she’s governing in the same pragmatic style as Rahm Emanuel. She may not like the comparison, but it’s very similar in terms of policy. The only difference is Rahm…did a very good job of building relationships with members of the city council, [and it showed] when they were called upon to cast difficult votes.”

Former Ald. Pat O’Connor (40th), who was Emanuel’s floor leader, said the council “could become a growing problem” for Lightfoot but not until life in Chicago returns to some semblance of normalcy.

“If you’ve got a life-threatening infection, you’re not worried about the fact you’ve got a hangnail somewhere,” O’Connor said. “She’s not gonna worry about what she needs from them until she needs it, while she can do the things with the pandemic that she’s got to do.”

Until the pandemic brought normal life to a halt, Lightfoot’s biggest concern was her war on poverty and her plan to target 10 inner-city neighborhoods for an unprecedented $250 million city investment and $500 million more from other government agencies.

She delivered a $15-an-hour minimum wage and a predictable scheduling ordinance — signature victories for organized labor. She pushed through the first installment of her plan to go easier on scofflaws.

But she still was being pressured from the left to deliver civilian police review, a police contract that makes it easier to discipline officers and more money for the homeless and affordable housing.

Now, COVID-19 occupies nearly every waking moment for Lightfoot and makes intransigent problems worse.

“The vulnerabilities of our city — poverty, the lack of access to health care, disparities in investment and jobs — those vulnerabilities are flashing like a neon sign every single day,” the mayor said.

“Black people are dying at an absolutely unfathomably high rate. Now, we’re seeing this huge surge of cases in the Latinx community…We’ve got to speed up the work. We don’t have the time to contemplate and think great thoughts.”

Jacky Grimshaw, who was one of Washington’s closest advisers, said Lightfoot “bit the bullet to do something that other mayors, really since Harold,” wouldn’t, confronting “inequities in the city and the way services are delivered.”

One element of that was appointing a chief equity officer.

Grimshaw said Lightfoot’s nonbinding “Housing Solidarity Pledge” was a disappointment and that she’s worried about a spike in foreclosures, evictions and homelessness tied to the coronavirus unless there is real rent relief.

But she said, “Maybe this was the best deal she could get. At least, she was trying to get something in terms of relief, even though it didn’t go far enough.”

Grimshaw was particularly impressed with the stay-at-home public service announcements engineered by marketing guru Michael Fassnacht. They have turned Lightfoot into an international celebrity.

“It wasn’t her doing in terms of creating the memes,” said Grimshaw, vice president for government affairs at the Center for Neighborhood Technology. “But she had the right person ….to help her, and she was willing to take his suggestions.

“She understood that it was a harsh thing to cut off the lakefront, and you couldn’t just be mean about it. You had to try and give people an understanding of why you had to make the decisions you made.”

Lightfoot’s tough-love message is not getting through to millennials, though. They have continued to party, oblivious to the stay-at-home order. That’s likely to only get worse as temperatures rise and the lakefront remains closed.

She has been criticized for strolling up to a playground and lecturing African American men playing basketball during the pandemic.

Chicago’s steely-eyed mayor makes no apologies. She said she is just trying to be “who I am: strong and steady.”

Lightfoot said it’s been a “different year than I would have predicted,” but she “wouldn’t trade a second of it — except for the loss of life.

“Not just from the pandemic,” she said. “The loss of life for gun violence. That still haunts me.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Two downstate Republicans balk at COVID-19 precautions,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K8IGyhC0fEa_3QHLAMHJxiyaR8I=/0x0:1275x668/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19981569/bailey_halbrook_combo_2.jpg,"SPRINGFIELD — With the pandemic now nearing its fourth month in Illinois, most residents have made up their minds on whether to wear masks or other face coverings, but two downstate Republicans say they need a few days to think it over.

“It boils down, in my book, to a matter of personal choice,” said state Rep. Brad Halbrook, R-Shelbyville.

That declaration of personal choice could soon be put to the test.

That’s because next week the Illinois Legislature is scheduled to return to session for the first time since March 5, but that return is not without some changes. Notably, the Illinois House will meet at the Bank of Springfield Center, and legislators will be asked to wear face masks, submit to COVID-19 tests and temperature checks and adhere to social distancing measures.

Mulling an about-face, Halbrook and fellow Republican state Rep. Darren Bailey of downstate Xenia said they won’t commit to wearing masks when the House meets on Wednesday, potentially creating a standoff between them and Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan.

Public health officials, including those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommend people wear cloth face coverings in “public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain” not only to prevent themselves from getting sick but also to prevent someone from unknowingly contracting the virus and spreading it to others.

And on Friday, Republican House Leader Jim Durkin urged GOP legislators to abide by those rules.

But Bailey, who is suing Gov. J.B. Pritzker over the Chicago Democrat’s stay-at-home order, said he’s not concerned about contracting COVID-19 and that House members who are should stay away from Springfield next week.

“So, if you are concerned about your health then, by all means, you should stay home or you wear a mask,” Bailey said. “If someone doesn’t want to wear a mask, then they’re simply taking the risk themselves.”

Halbrook said he is concerned that wearing a face covering could have negative health consequences for him. While Halbrook did not say whether he had an underlying health condition that could prevent him from wearing a mask, he said he wants to meet with his primary care doctor before he makes that decision.

“I need to understand one-on-one with a professional what the dangers are, what is the upside, what’s the downside,” Halbrook said. “I just want to have that conversation, and I have not been able to get to that person to have that conversation. I’m just trying to make a well-informed decision.”

For weeks, Republicans called for the General Assembly return, but it was only after Pritzker joined that chorus that fellow Democrats Madigan and Senate President Don Harmon agreed.

In a letter to Durkin announcing the return to Springfield, Madigan wrote that he was asking House members to follow “approved precautions” from the Illinois Department of Public Health, which included wearing a face mask.

With Bailey and Halbrook as potential holdouts, Durkin sent a letter his GOP caucus on Friday asking members to “abide by best practices and safety protocols put forth by the Illinois Department of Public Health, which include temperature checks and wearing a protective mask.”

“We have a duty to not only uphold the Constitution but to also protect the health and well-being of our citizens and that includes our staff, House personnel, our colleagues, their families and members of the public,” the Western Springs Republican wrote.

Bailey and Halbrook are the first two Republicans to object.

In response, state Rep. Emanuel “Chris” Welch, D-Hillside, took to Twitter to call for the downstate Republicans and any other House members who refuse to wear face coverings to be “banned from entering the convention center.”

“Your intentional, reckless act to ignore the face mask guidance will risk lives. I’m aware of members in our caucus and your caucus with newborns at home,” Welch tweeted.

Whether any bare-faced legislators will be barred from the Bank of Springfield Center remains to be seen.

Madigan spokesman Steve Brown wouldn’t say whether the guidelines spelled out by the Southwest Side Democrat will be enforced, only that “we remain very hopeful that all members respect their colleagues and staff.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Those seven locations – three of them in Chicago — will open next week to provide only the vehicle registration renewal as a way to serve both the public and as a test run as Secretary of State Jesse White begins to slowly reopen the facilities.

“This is the first step in the process of reopening the office, and we thought this was a good way to go about it, that there really wouldn’t be much direct contact with people,” said Dave Druker, a spokesman for office. “The public would not be coming into a building. It would be a drive-thru, like we’re doing a hamburger and a shake.”

Drivers can access the drive-thru services beginning May 19.

The three Chicago Secretary of State facilities are Chicago North, 5401 N. Elston Ave.; Chicago South, 9901 S. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive; and Chicago West, 5301 W. Lexington. All three will be open Mondays and Saturdays from 7:30 a.m. to 2 p.m., and Tuesday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Drivers will not be allowed to pay in cash.

Drive-thru service will be offered at the facilities in Rockford, Macomb in western Illinois and Tilton in east-central Illinois on Tuesdays from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Wednesday through Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturdays from 7:30 a.m. to noon.

The Springfield-Dirksen location will be open on Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Motorists can still renew their registrations online, but the new drive-thru facilities will serve as an alternative. Secretary of State employees will be required to wear personal protective equipment, and drivers will be encouraged to wear face masks.

The state requires vehicles in the Chicago and Metro East areas to pass an emissions test before drivers can renew their registrations, but the testing sites are closed. So, with emissions tests sites and vehicle services shut down because of the pandemic, people who have expired vehicle registrations have 90 days after vehicle services fully open up again to renew which will likely be around June 1, Druker said.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

We turned to Chicago’s Joffrey Ballet company members Brooke Linford, Princess Reid and Graham Maverick to share some easy-to-do-at-home exercises to help tone and stretch. They’re easy enough to do while binge-watching your favorite Netflix series, and best of all, they’re ideal for everyone from workout novices to diehards.

“I now try to work out five days a week,” said Linford, a six-year member of the Joffrey. “Especially stretching. It’s so important.”

While the dancers technically work out six days a week during a regular Joffrey season with rehearsals, dance classes and general exercise, the pandemic has meant the cancellation of the company’s entire season — and that community experience. And while the company provides online classes via Zoom three times a week for its dancers, working out during a quarantine has become an individual effort.

“The [online] classes make us feel like we’re all together in a way, but working out on our own is a big part of [staying in shape],” Linford said. “I would encourage everyone to try some kind of stretching exercise a few days a week if possible, even for 15 minutes. Most important is to set goals for yourself and not get discouraged or frustrated. You don’t need a full, intense workout every day. Just do what you can to make your body feel healthy and happy.”

Favorite workout and why: I love working out in many different ways. Between yoga, ballet, biking or just going to the gym it’s hard to say what is my favorite. One of the exercises that I have been doing more now at the house has been calf raises. You stand with the ball of one foot on the bottom step and do about 20 to 30 releves (rises) on each side at a time. It helps strengthen both your calves and ankles, and you should get a nice burn quickly.

Some things to think about when doing your calf raises: Make sure that your body is completely parallel with your foot and when you do the raises make sure that you not only go all the way up but also down. One of the best things about this workout is that you don’t need much to do it, only a staircase or even a large [hardcover] book such as one of the later “Harry Potter” books.

Music inspiration: I enjoy a lot of music, new and old, but what I’ve been playing for my workout recently has been Black Sabbath’s first album. Really gets the blood going for me.

Favorite workout and why: My favorite exercise is clamshells because I feel like it is the “magic physical therapy exercise” to make my body happy and healthy. It targets the gluteus medius, and in doing so also provides stability in the ankles, knees and back. I feel like at any given time in ballet class or rehearsal there is always one person doing clamshells.

What should people make sure they do in order to do this exercise correctly: There are different angles at which you can have your knees and still have it work. But the most important thing is to not rotate your hips [forward] and keep your body in line. Sometimes I like to put my hand on my hip to make sure I’m not opening up to get a little more rotation with my knee.

Best household item to accompany your workout: For extra strengthening it’s helpful to add a resistance band or theraband tied above your knees. But if you don’t have that available, using your hand on your thigh and gently pushing when opening and closing adds good resistance as well.

Favorite workout song: It depends on my mood, but right now I’m feeling the disco essentials playlist on Apple Music. I definitely need something with a strong or funky beat to help motivate myself.

Favorite workout and why: My favorite workout is actually a stretch called the “pigeon pose.” I like this stretch because it really gets into your hamstring and the front of your hip (hip flexor). It’s nice to do before a class or workout.

Favorite workout song: One of my favorite songs to workout to is “Fantazia” by Roy Blair. I like this one because the beat is great for cardio.

Then, when the only other customer left, he went to the counter, pulled out a small pistol, pointed it at the clerk and demanded that he open the cash register.

The scene, the FBI contends in a court document, was repeated by Lopez in four other gas station stores over eight days before his April 9 arrest. It underscores a troubling new reality for law enforcement: Masks that have made criminals stand apart long before bandanna-wearing robbers knocked over stagecoaches in the Old West and ski-masked bandits held up banks now allow them to blend in like concerned accountants, nurses and store clerks trying to avoid a deadly virus.

“Criminals, they’re smart and this is a perfect opportunity for them to conceal themselves and blend right in,” said Richard Bell, police chief in the tiny Pennsylvania community of Frackville. He said he knows of seven recent armed robberies in the region where every suspect wore a mask.

Across the United States, masks have become more and more prevalent, first as a voluntary precaution and then as a requirement imposed by governmental agencies and businesses. And people with masks — as well as latex gloves — have found their way into more and more crime reports.

Just how many criminals are taking advantage of the pandemic to commit crimes is impossible to estimate, but law enforcement officials have no doubt the numbers are climbing. Reports are starting to pop up across the United States and in other parts of the world of crimes pulled off in no small part because so many of us are now wearing masks.

In March, two men walked into Aqueduct Racetrack in New York wearing the same kind of surgical masks as many racing fans there and, at gunpoint, robbed three workers of a quarter-million dollars they were moving from gaming machines to a safe. Other robberies involving suspects wearing surgical masks have occurred in North Carolina, and Washington, D.C, and elsewhere in recent weeks.

The problem isn’t limited to robberies. In the troubled Cook County Jail in Chicago, the virus has led to at least nine deaths and sickened hundreds of inmates and correctional officers. Staffers must wear masks and inmates are issued a new one every day — a policy that helped one inmate escape on May 2.

Jahquez Scott, jailed on a gun charge and for violating his bond in a drug case, has tattoos of a small heart on one cheek and what looks like a blood-dripping scar on the other. But when he wore a mask, he posed as Quintin Henderson — who doesn’t have tattoos on his face and was scheduled to be released, authorities said.

Scott made it out, though he was captured a week later.

In addition to rare jailbreaks, the prevalence of masks in society has created other problems for law enforcement. Before life in a pandemic, masked marauders had to free their faces immediately after leaving a bank or store to avoid suspicion once in the general public. But it came with the risk of being photographed and identified through omnipresent surveillance cameras and cellphones.

These days, they can keep the masks on and blend in easily with or without being “captured” in images.

“The video is much less useful if we are unable to see a face,” said Carlos Marquez, a detective division commander in the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, in an email.

It’s leaving law enforcement without a crucial crime-solving tool.

“Guys are like, ‘OK, I have to wear a mask, the police are not going to stop me on the way to a crime and back from a crime wearing a mask,’” said Brendan Deenihan, chief of detectives for Chicago Police Department. “Now if you are going to commit a crime you can leave your house with a mask on and drive for an hour.”

With everyone basically incognito, would-be witnesses might not notice someone acting differently, and that would make it harder to get a good description or identification of the suspect, said Eric Nuñez, chief of the Los Alamitos Police Department in Southern California and president of the California Police Chiefs Association.

It’s less likely now that other shoppers would “stare at them, just making mental notes of what they look like,” Nuñez said. “If they look like everybody else walking in, they may not do that at all.”

It’s a real problem for clerks and tellers, such as Tiffany Becker, who manages a Valero convenience store in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, where a number of stores in the area have been robbed by mask-wearing gunmen recently.

“Before I would have called the police because having a mask wasn’t normal. Now it’s normal,” Becker said. “It’s scary because you can’t tell who is safe and who’s not.”

Even when investigators identify suspects, the protective gear makes putting cases together all that much more difficult. The same latex gloves more people are wearing to protect themselves from picking up the virus will mean fewer fingerprints at crime scenes.

“In the past if you did a search warrant and you found surgical masks, that would be highly indicative of something (suspicious),” said FBI Special Agent Lisa MacNamara, who investigated the string of robberies in Connecticut that led to the arrest of Rosario Lopez. “Now everybody has masks or latex gloves.”

But the reverse can also be true.

MacNamara and her team’s investigation was made easier when his alleged accomplice went into the stores “acting as a lookout or ‘casing’ robbery locations.”

Obama spoke on “Show Me Your Walk, HBCU Edition,” a two-hour event for students graduating from historically black colleges and universities broadcast on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. His remarks were unexpectedly political, given the venue, and touched on current events beyond the virus and its social and economic impacts.

“More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they’re doing,” Obama said. “A lot them aren’t even pretending to be in charge.”

Later Saturday, during a second televised commencement address for high school seniors, Obama panned “so-called grown-ups, including some with fancy titles and important jobs” who do “what feels good, what’s convenient, what’s easy.”

“Which is why things are so screwed up,” he said.

Obama did not name President Donald Trump or any other federal or state officials in either of his appearances. But earlier this month, he harshly criticized Trump’s handling of the pandemic as an “absolute chaotic disaster” in a call with 3,000 members of his administrations obtained by Yahoo News.

The commencement remarks were the latest sign that Obama intends to play an increasingly active role in the coming election. He has generally kept a low profile in the years since he left office, even as Trump has disparaged him. Obama told supporters on the call that he would be “spending as much time as necessary and campaigning as hard as I can” for Joe Biden, who served as his vice president.

As he congratulated the college graduates Saturday and commiserated over the enormous challenges they face given the devastation and economic turmoil the virus has wrought, the former president noted the February shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery, 25, who was killed while jogging on a residential street in Georgia.

“Let’s be honest: A disease like this just spotlights the underlying inequalities and extra burdens that black communities have historically had to deal with in this country,” Obama said. “We see it in the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on our communities, just as we see it when a black man goes for a jog and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him if he doesn’t submit to their questioning.”

“Injustice like this isn’t new,” Obama went on to say. “What is new is that so much of your generation has woken up to the fact that the status quo needs fixing, that the old ways of doing things don’t work.” In the face of a void in leadership, he said, it would be up to the graduates to shape the future.

“If the world’s going to get better, it’s going to be up to you,” he said.

It is a perilous time for the nation’s historically black colleges and universities, which have long struggled with less funding and smaller endowments than their predominantly white peers and are now dealing with the financial challenges of the coronavirus. Even at the better-endowed HBCUs, officials are bracing for a tough few years.

Obama’s message to high school students came at the end of an hourlong television special featuring celebrities, including LeBron James, Yara Shahidi and Ben Platt, and was less sharp-edged than his speech to the college graduates. He urged the young graduates to be unafraid despite the current challenges facing the nation and to strive to be part of a diverse community.

“Leave behind all the old ways of thinking that divide us — sexism, racial prejudice, status, greed — and set the world on a different path,” Obama said.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

J.B. Pritzker has repeatedly said he’s delegating enforcement of his stay-at-home order to local governments.

That stance has frustrated some folks who want him to get tougher with violators (although he’d undoubtedly risk making martyrs out of them if he did crack down hard). And the governor’s position seems to have emboldened some local officials to defy the governor’s executive order and open up their economies on their own.

But when local governments refuse to enforce the governor’s order, it appears that trial lawyers might step in and insurance companies might take a walk.

Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.

A growing number of Downstate sheriffs, state’s attorneys and other officials have declared they won’t be enforcing the governor’s stay-at-home order. The Woodford County state’s attorney has said he won’t prosecute violators, as has the White County state’s attorney. Johnson County’s sheriff is one of several who’ve said he also wouldn’t arrest anyone for violating the order.

East Peoria’s mayor has gone beyond even that, officially allowing the “opening” of several businesses in his city on May 1 that were ordered closed by the governor’s executive order, including hair salons, spas, gyms and indoor recreational facilities. On May 15, bars and restaurants will be allowed to reopen at 50 percent capacity, and churches and theaters also will be allowed to reopen on that date.

But the Illinois Trial Lawyers Association has a message for those renegade municipalities and businesses preparing to throw open their doors: Watch out for lawsuits.

“The risk of opening early outweighs the benefit of limiting liability not only for the municipality but also for any employer who follows the guidelines of the municipality,” said ITLA President Antonio Romanucci in a written statement. “The prudent course would be to stay closed for another 25 days and limit any further potential spread which could lead to litigation.”

I asked Pritzker at a recent press conference what he thought of the warning from trial lawyers.

“Well, I was a businessman before I became governor,” Pritzker replied, “and I have to tell you that I would not want to defy the executive order because I believe that I would be taking on liability if I did that.”

Those towns and businesses could find themselves without insurance coverage should something go wrong.

Kevin Martin, executive director of the Illinois Insurance Association, told me that insurance policies are “not going to cover intentional acts.” In other words, if a business intentionally reopens in violation of the executive order and somebody injures himself at the establishment or contracts the virus, insurance coverage won’t be a given. The same may go for municipalities that openly violate the executive order.

The Illinois Department of Insurance also chimed in, saying via press release: “If businesses reopen contrary to public health guidelines and the state’s executive orders, there is risk that an insurer could find reason within the policy language to deny COVID-19 related claims.”

I asked Pritzker at that same press about insurance issues.

“It would not surprise me if insurance companies are found to not be required to cover you when you are defying essentially state law or a state executive order,” he replied.

The Illinois Retail Merchants Association has taken the position from the beginning that the executive order is “the best course of action for both consumers and employees,” the group’s president, Rob Karr, said via written statement. “We have also advised retailers of both the liability, insurance and other legal issues that may arise from not following the state’s guidance.”

The Illinois Restaurant Association also released a statement saying the group has encouraged its members to follow the executive order. The Illinois Licensed Beverage Association, which represents tavern owners, said it “does not advise” its members to violate the executive order.

The governor has pointed out several times that many of the businesses that are defiantly reopening have state licenses. Your local barber or salon owner needs a state license to open and operate. Cosmetologists, electrologists, massage therapists and nail technicians are just some of the others who must have state licenses. Restaurants and taverns are under state oversight and can be closed down by local public health departments in situations just like this.

The bottom line is, if you don’t fear the virus, then you might want to start to fear being wiped out by lawsuits not covered by insurance or losing your license.

On Thursday, Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, commanding general of the Army Corps of Engineers, was in Chicago at McCormick Place, where he’s in charge of putting up a massive field hospital for COVID-19 patients facing a different kind of catastrophe.

Traveling with his staff microbiologist, Semonite, 62, gave elbow bumps to those in the small group greeting him.

He’s overseeing nine such projects, with many more expected. On Wednesday, he was in Detroit. Then, he flew to Illinois to meet with Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a “phenomenal lady,” he said. Thursday morning, he toured McCormick Place before jumping on a small jet to visit another city.

Semonite said he’s prioritizing the Corps’ projects based on the rate of growth of the virus in each city and how many hospital beds are needed.

The numbers that tell the story: Our coronavirus data tracking On our Coronavirus Data page, you’ll find a collection of graphs, charts and maps tracing the spread of the virus, tracking test results and plotting the impact on individual counties. Check back daily for updated totals.

“At the end of the day, though, the single biggest reason why we would come to Chicago or somewhere else is that governor feels that there’s a very, very critical requirement,” Semonite said.

Pritzker is “very, very focused on being able to try to take care of this town,” Semonite said.

New York was the model for the Corps’ efforts after the Javits convention center was recently converted into a hospital for sick and injured people who aren’t infected with COVID-19. A Navy hospital ship is housing patients sent from Javits.

The Army Corps is building nine such projects across the country with a total of 9,500 beds, according to Semonite, who said he expects to sign contracts in the next two days for another eight projects with 4,000 more beds.

“We’ve looked at almost 600 different facilities,” he said.

About a week ago, Semonite said he was notified by the secretary of the Army that Pritzker was “very, very concerned about the bed shortage up here.”

A division commander, Major Gen. Mark Toy, then met with Pritzker, and construction was launched on the McCormick Place’“alternative care facility,” which is short of a full-blown hospital.

Three exhibition halls at the convention center are being converted into medical wings, one of which will have 500 beds ready to use Friday, Semonite said.

Another 2,500 beds will be installed in stages to meet what officials say could be a peak in coronavirus diagnoses in Chicago around mid-April. The buildout is being paid for with $15 million in federal emergency funding.

People with varying degrees of coronavirus complications will be housed in each of the three converted exhibition halls.

The state is in charge of staffing the facility with health-care professionals. Pritzker has said the state is asking for volunteers and hiring people from contracting services. He said enough workers have been hired to staff at least 500 beds.

Officials have said they also were working to create temporary bed capacity at the shuttered MetroSouth Hospital in Blue Island and the Elgin site where Sherman Hospital was before being demolished.

In Chicago, United Center is being used for food distribution, first-responder staging and collecting medical supplies.

Walsh Construction is building the infrastructure for the field hospital at Place.

Illinois National Guard troops are assembling the beds and other equipment.

Semonite said the project is based on one of four standard designs for retrofitting big spaces like convention centers, vacant hospitals, dorms and sports arenas. Seattle’s CenturyLink Field, where the Seahawks play, also is being retrofitted.

The Chicago Sun-Times wasn’t allowed to tour the field hospital inside McCormick Place,, which Semonite described as a series of three-walled pods with a curtain at each opening. The metal-braced walls are the same ones vendors use during trade shows, he said. Each pod has a bed and chair. Nurses’ stations are in the corridors.

Oxygen is being pumped into the field hospital, and engineers in McCormick Place have calibrated the heat and air-conditioning system to provide “negative pressure” that keeps contaminants from escaping, Semonite said.

“I’ve got to admit the staff in some of these big facilities is amazing,” he said. “I met with the leadership of McCormick yesterday. They’re doing a lot of the work.”

Semonite said Walsh Construction is among contractors across the country who’ve been asking to help the Army Corps.

“This is not about trying to make a buck on a contract,” he said. “This is about taking care of the local citizens of this city, of this state, because these are all our people.

“President Trump said a couple of weeks ago, ‘This is when America really needs to rally to be able to come together.’ ”

Semonite said one of his biggest aims is to make it as easy as possible for cities and states to build such field hospitals quickly.

Semonite said the Army Corps’ response to the pandemic in some respects is more difficult than the other big challenges he’s been associated with in his more than 40-year military career, such as rebuilding communities after hurricanes swept through.

“When Mother Nature strikes, and even to a degree in combat operations, you have a pretty good understanding of what the set you’re going to inherit is when a hurricane comes,” he said. “It’s terrifying for 12 to 14 or 24 hours. But the next morning when you wake up, you kind of know what has to be built.

“And we kind of have defined the problem, and then we all attack. We don’t know where this one’s going to end. How long is this going to go? How long do facilities like this have to be run?

“This is an extremely complicated challenge,” he said. “And we are not going to be able to solve this with a complicated solution.”

At a news conference Thursday, Pritzker said he has toured the hospital being built at McCormick Place: “I didn’t know you could build something like that in five days.”

“You should all feel very, very proud of the work that’s been done so quickly,” Pritzker said, calling the carpenters, National Guardsmen and other workers at McCormick Place “patriotic.”

“They know they are doing something that’s going to save people’s lives.”

“I’m an electrical engineer, we do the sign and planning of different facilities. I’ve been under self quarantine for the past couple of weeks which means I’ve been working from home. I typically do not do that. I avoid going outside at all costs but its a little bit hard to keep myself locked up all day. What I do is take moments like this to take a little break and go outside for a five minute, 10 minute walk. I keep myself away from people. I do not go to any public places where people could be and just keep some sort of healthy habits in my daily routine.”

“Me personally, I’m an extrovert. I like to be around people, to talk to people. I love to talk to people so it’s been tough but I’ve been trying to identify that and be like I need to have discipline.”

Jason, college student

“I think this is the first time I’ve left my house since probably two weeks. I think it’s important to keep practicing social distancing even when you are out. I’m trying to avoid visiting places and talking to other people. I’m sure my mental health has declined staying inside the last two weeks. It’s messing with my education. I haven’t been able to go to school in three weeks now.”

“I don’t even think things will really go back to normal, the way they were before this. It just changed the whole narrative for everything. It changed everything pretty much.”

Nycole Stoudt, Service industry employee

“I work in the restaurant industry so we were kind of early on shut downs. I think everybody is a little nervous about what they are going to do to pay their bills, rent especially. We have zoom cocktail hours set up for later this evening to kind of bring everybody together and just say hi to each other.”

“The Sunday when Governor [J.B.] Pritzker announced restaurants and bars would be closing, that was a big moment for me where it’s like ok things are really going to change drastically and we all need to take the steps necessary to quell any further passing on of the virus to others. It’s boring but it’s not the worst thing in the world to have to stay in a little bit more.”

Karen and Richard Shapiro, retired

KS: “I’m 73 and he’s 76, we’re healthy. I don’t think about it. I kind of feel like by now if we don’t have it we’re all carriers. I don’t think there’s anybody who is not a carrier. I just use that mindset and be careful.”

RS: “I’m not concerned at all. There’s so many people they haven’t tested so they really don’t know how extensive this could be, but they’re getting there.”

KS: “We’ll get through it.”

Joanna Griffin, Healthcare worker

“Unfortunately I have to come out to defeat the battle and help the team out as much as possible. This is part of being in healthcare. For the team that I’m working for they are understaffed right now but everyone is just really trying to be optimistic and do the first thing first, making sure we take care of the patients.”

“I’ve been doing about five days a week and I’ve been going by METRA. The perfect thing about this is there aren’t too many people on the train. It’s not too bad. I had my concerns making sure they are clean on the trains. METRA is very good about that. I have no concerns about that, I know they’ve definitely been doing their part of safety first.”

Barry DeBois, Actor/Singer

“I was bartending between those things and then I quit my bartending job to start a theater gig and then that got canceled because all theater is being canceled at the moment. I still have to pay rent.”

“Basically I’m trying to take gigs where I’m keeping my distance from people but those are very limited jobs. I’ve talked to friends in the theater community and they’re doing different stuff. Some people are teaching english to people in China. There are a lot of remote teaching opportunities people have gotten into.”

“If I’m not working in theater I’m working in the service industry and both of those are demolished right now. So I don’t know when I’m going to make normal money again which is kind of scary. We just moved into this new, beautiful apartment.”

Tamas Vilaghy, Service industry employee

“I work at a wine shop and there was a bar component which has shut we’re figuring out if we can do take out and carry out and delivery. The wine shop has remained open so that’s giving me a little bit of income.”

“I live with my wife so it’s nice to have someone there. We take a walk at night but that’s about it. She’s a musician so all of her gigs have dried up. She’s trying to teach over zoom right now but it’s uncertain as well whether or not that can continue. The teachers I know are at a loss about this too.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

But the 2020 graduate from the University of Illinois at Chicago did so from the backyard of her family’s Berwyn home, not on campus with the momentous ceremony she’d always imagined.

“It was a little bit strange — maybe, in some ways, disappointing,” said Mendez, a first-generation college grad. “Just because I didn’t get to walk across the stage.”

She joined more than 5,000 UIC students — and tens of thousands more at other Illinois schools — left with no choice but to celebrate their graduation with an online ceremony in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.

UIC still plans to hold an in-person commencement for their 2020 class sometime later this year, but with the state’s stay-at-home order banning large gatherings, the virtual stand-in will have to do for now.

And for Mendez, like millions of students nationwide, the COVID-19 shutdown has disrupted far more than just graduation.

Mendez and two of her classmates were the first to come out of UIC’s revamped Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art Education program, which resumed in 2017 after a long hiatus.

The culmination of Mendez’s UIC experience — a student-teaching tenure at Benito Juarez High School in Pilsen, where she mentored sophomores and seniors in art classes — was nonetheless cut short by the pandemic.

“I didn’t really get to say goodbye,” she said. “I knew things that they were going through, but we also got to learn from each other. I feel like maybe they could see themselves in me, just because there’s not a lot of teachers of color or women of color that teach in Chicago Public Schools.”

Mendez entered UIC eyeing a career in medicine, but an elective art class she opened her eyes to a field that fulfilled her creativity, her desire to create positive change and her struggles with her own identity.

“I wanted to... give younger students the opportunity of taking art courses that I didn’t have when I was in high school,” she said. “It’s really therapeutic to do so, [because] art is a way to figure out or reflect on your experiences and find your identity and go back to your roots. Because when you are a first-generation [college student] and a Latina, it’s hard to connect when you have these two sides of yourself.”

Her career passion as an art teacher cemented, Mendez has already been accepted into Chicago Public Schools’ early offer program, which guarantees her a job somewhere within the district next school year.

She’s still applying for specific positions, ranging from elementary to high-school level, while planning out how to earn a master’s degree in Latino Studies at some point down the road.

While her final months as an undergraduate might not have gone as planned, Mendez says she finds positives even in that inconvenience.

First, experiencing online classes as a student could help her teach them in the future — perhaps from the get-go, with no guarantee on when in-person classes will be able to resume anywhere in the state as the pandemic unfolds.

And second, “if this wasn’t happening, my dad is constantly working, so he probably wouldn’t have been able to make it [to my graduation],” she said. “But because of this virus happening, he was able to be here, and friends and family were able to congratulate me.”

Mendez is also going to order a cap and gown soon, despite knowing she might not ever get to wear them onstage.

Because those tangible symbols, as thousands of other 2020 college graduates are discovering, are sometimes the only things making the accomplishment feel real these days.

“This all feels surreal because it’s not in-person and it’s not in the traditional way, but it’ll be really exciting,” Mendez said. “That’s finally when it’s going to hit me that I graduated.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The rate of positive COVID-19 tests has gone from 97% to less than 10% since March, Cook County Health officials said in a statement.

Since May 8, most of the new cases have come from detainees entering the jail, rather than people who were already in custody, officials said.

They credited the decline to interventions implemented since the beginning of the year, including opening unused divisions to accommodate social distancing, converting available cells to single-occupancy and enhanced testing.

“As we watched this pandemic approach Cook County, we understood the potential impact it could have at the jail and worked with our public safety partners to release non-violent offenders,” Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle said in the statement. “This was both the right thing to do for these individuals and the right thing to do to mitigate spread inside the jail.”

In March, the jail released several detainees deemed “highly vulnerable” to the coronavirus.

Earlier this month, the jail ran out of electronic monitoring bracelets, which inmate advocates warned could strain the sheriff’s office’s ability to socially distance detainees.

As of Friday evening, 115 detainees are currently positive for COVID-19, according to the Cook County sheriff’s office. So far, seven detainees and three sheriff’s office employees, including two correctional officers, have died from the virus.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The 43-year-old raised his camera and took a photograph. Later, it would become one of the images Uwakwe used to create paintings inspired by the pandemic.

“To see maybe six people there, everyone wearing a mask,” he said, “it brought everything together.”

Around the world, people like Uwakwe are creating photographs, paintings, emails, journals and social media posts that will shape how the world remembers the coronavirus pandemic for years and centuries to come. Museums and historical societies already are collecting materials, often with help from people accustomed to capturing and sharing even the most mundane moments around them.

The result, historians say, will be a collective memory more personal than perhaps any other moment in history.

“Everyone is touched by this. Everyone has a story,” said Erika Holst, curator of history at the Illinois State Museum, one of hundreds across the U.S. gathering pieces of a generational treasure trove. Collecting the items in real time allows historians to nudge people for the stories behind them — a luxury rarely available, Holst said.

“Usually as historians, we get a lot of numbers — the number of people who died, the number who got sick, the economic effect,” she said. “It doesn’t always capture what it felt like.”

The enormity of the event is forcing historians to balance capturing ephemeral moments and those that will transcend time.

At the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History, a task force is looking into how to gather and preserve objects, images and documents that could become part of permanent collections. But the pandemic itself is challenging the group’s ability to collect because the museum is closed, so curators are asking potential donors to hold onto items.

“We are trying to take the long view on this, so (we are) focusing now most on objects that are ephemeral, things that might disappear, that might get thrown away or just used up,” said Benjamin Filene, the museum’s associate director of curatorial affairs.

Unlike during other national crises, people have a camera in their pocket at all times, documenting whatever they deem relevant and sharing it on social media, from the cloth mask they sew and the sourdough bread they baked to the cheer for front-line workers and the Zoom meeting of school students.

But not every quilt made or puzzle finished can tell the story of what happened in the U.S. in the spring of 2020.

“There is sort of this overwhelming mass of information, but that information is not necessarily being captured in a way that’s going to be preserved,” Filene said. “And there’s also the possibility that it is so fragmentary that how much will it translate to somebody else five years from now or 25 or 50 years from now? We don’t just need a thing; we want the story that goes with the thing.”

The National Museum of African American History and Culture has been working with doctors, nurses and other health workers who have offered to donate personal protective equipment. Senior curator for history William Pretzer said cultural organizations nowadays do “rapid-response collecting” and no longer wait until materials are considered memorabilia.

“You collected stuff because you had historical perspective on that event. You collected the Civil War 20 years after the Civil War. You collected World War II experience in the 1950s,” Pretzer said. “You didn’t do it immediately. Beginning in some ways with 9/11, however, it became clear that rapid-response collecting, collecting on the spot meant that you got the original evidence.”

Pretzer said the museum wants to “go behind the statistics” showing the virus has disproportionately affected people of color. and explain the reasons for the disparity and what can be done about it in the future.

“In other words, it’s not a race or color or ethnicity that determines this disproportionate impact. It’s the underlying conditions,” Pretzer said. “What’s the economic role? What kinds of jobs are available in that community? What kind of access to health care do people have? What type of access to healthy foods have they had? What access to transportation? What is education like in those communities?”

Technology is helping historians collect material and tell stories as well. The Historic New Orleans Collection, a museum and publishing house, is using technology known as a “spider” to crawl the web and collect information about how the pandemic is affecting the hard-hit city. Among its finds: the city’s cellphone alert system’s webpage.

The Maryland Historical Society is sharing posts on its blog and on social media using its own hashtags, #LettersFromtheHomeFrontMD and #CollectingInQuarantineMD. An April 16 entry includes a letter from a woman identified as Lauren from Darlington, Maryland, explaining her fears of contracting COVID-19 while at work. She said she works for the U.S. Postal Service, while her husband is an electrical foreman.

“I have two young children at home and I can not afford to stay home and only receive two-thirds of my pay,” she wrote. “We are both exposed to the world ... My mother can not get this disease, it may kill her.”

Heather Voelz of Taylorville, Illinois, submitted a photo to the Illinois State Museum of her kids on Easter. But she said most of what she’s recording are things that “wouldn’t mean much to anyone but us.” Voelz and two of her children, ages 3 and 5, are keeping a kids’ journal she found online, and Voelz plans to put the pages in their baby books.

“I know they don’t fully grasp what is happening,” she said. “But they will someday.”

Zofia Oles, 18, of suburban Chicago started taking photos for her school photography class but kept at it to remember her senior year. Some photos show Oles dancing alone in her room, she and her brother going to the store and neighbors gathering — at a distance — in a parking lot.

“I want to have a memory of how it looked so when I am able to be with my friends again, I can appreciate how it was,” she said.

Uwakwe said recent weeks remind him of the days after 9/11, when streets were quiet and there was a collective sense of grieving, helping and appreciation for people on the front lines.

Uwakwe didn’t walk around with a camera back then. In the years since, he’s thought about those missed images. It’s what ultimately moved him to get in his car and capture what’s happening.

The 208-199 vote, with all but one Republican opposed, advances what boils down to a campaign-season display of Democratic economic and health-care priorities. It has no chance of becoming law as written, but will likely spark difficult negotiations with the White House and Senate Republicans. Any product would probably be the last major COVID-19 response bill before November’s presidential and congressional elections.

The enormous Democratic measure would cost more than the prior four coronavirus bills combined. It would deliver almost $1 trillion for state and local governments, another round of $1,200 direct payments to individuals and help for the unemployed, renters and homeowners, college debt holders and the struggling Postal Service.

“Not to act now is not only irresponsible in a humanitarian way, it is irresponsible because it’s only going to cost more,” warned House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. “More in terms of lives, livelihood, cost to the budget, cost to our democracy.”

Republicans mocked the bill as a bloated Democratic wish-list that was dead on arrival in the GOP-led Senate and, for good measure, faced a White House veto threat. Party leaders say they want to assess how $3 trillion approved earlier is working and see if some states’ partial business re-openings would spark an economic revival that would ease the need for more safety net programs.

Republicans are also sorting through internal divisions and awaiting stronger signals from President Donald Trump about what he will support.

“Phase Four is going to happen,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, using Washington insider-speak for the measure. “But it’s going to happen in a much better way for the American people.”

Trump and top Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are insisting the next measure should protect reopening businesses from liability lawsuits. The president is also demanding a cut to payroll taxes, but GOP leaders are not yet on board.

The daylong debate painted a Capitol scene that’s become common in the era of coronavirus, even as it remains disconcerting. The sparsely populated House floor was dotted with lawmakers and aides wearing protective masks and even gloves, though some Republicans lacked them.

Many members looked shaggier and sported beards they had not worn weeks ago. Roll call votes lasted over an hour each because lawmakers were voting in small groups to limit crowding.

To enhance the bill’s political impact, Democrats named their measure “The Heroes Act” for the payments it would provide front-line emergency workers. With more than 86,000 Americans dead, 1.4 million confirmed infections and 36 million filing unemployment claims in an frozen economy, Democrats saw GOP opposition as an easy campaign-season target.

“Are you kidding me?” said Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, of Republican assertions that it was time to stop spending more money. “Where do you guys live? Food lines at our food banks around the block? In the United States of America?”

Republicans saw the bill as a Democratic political blunder. They said overly generous unemployment benefits discouraged people from returning to work, and attacked language helping immigrants in the U.S. illegally get federal benefits. They also singled out provisions helping states set up voting by mail and easing the marijuana industry’s access to banks.

“It may help the cannabis industry, but it won’t help Main Street,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.

Pelosi pushed the measure through after overcoming party divisions aggravated by election pressures. Some moderate Democrats opposed the package for its price tag and politically fraught provisions like assisting marijuana businesses. A few progressive Democrats were upset because it did not do more, such as guaranteeing workers’ salaries and bolstering their health insurance coverage.

Fourteen Democrats voted against the measure. Nearly all are centrists and number among the party’s most vulnerable lawmakers in November’s elections: freshmen from districts Trump won in 2016.

Among them was Rep. Cindy Axne of Iowa, who labeled the measure “bloated.” Another, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, tweeted, “This bill strays far beyond delivering relief or responding to an urgent crisis, & it has no chance at becoming law.”

Republicans were already planning to use the day’s votes against other moderate Democrats who backed Friday’s legislation and face competitive reelection races.

Clearly, the bipartisan consensus that produced four previous coronavirus bills was crumbling quickly. Polls show GOP voters are satisfied with the federal response and aren’t agitating for more. Self-branded deficit hawks are citing the massive increase in the spiraling $25 trillion national debt.

Some congressional aides said the Democratic bill’s real price tag could breach $3.5 trillion. A partial estimate of tax provisions alone revealed eye-popping costs: $412 billion to renew $1,200 cash payments to individuals, more than $100 billion to pay health insurance premiums for the unemployed and $164 billion to make an “employee retention” tax credit for businesses more generous.

Republicans leaders faced disunity between conservatives who feel enough has been done and pragmatists who back rescuing the Postal Service from looming insolvency and delivering cash to revenue-starved state and local governments. The huge price tag and a lack of consultation with Republicans by Pelosi cemented GOP opposition.

“This bill is nothing more than the Democratic policy agenda masquerading as a response to the coronavirus crisis,” said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla. He said the bill is “going nowhere, and is going nowhere fast.”

Liberal Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., also opposed the bill. She told reporters that if constituents ask her if the bill would put money in their pockets or preserve their health care, “I can’t tell them yes.”

The lone Republican backing the legislation was Rep. Peter King of New York, who is retiring.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

State totals now stand at 1,975 deaths and 13,218 confirmed cases in nursing homes, according to a count by the Chicago Sun-Times. Long-term care facilities account for 48.7% of all coronavirus deaths in Illinois, records show.

The state’s long-term care facilities reported 455 new deaths and 2,405 new cases this week, according to data released Friday by state health officials.

New deaths were reported at 180 facilities this week, and 259 homes said they had at least one new confirmed case.

A total of 86 homes have seen double-digit deaths tallies, up from 50 last week. There are now 27 facilities reporting at least 100 confirmed cases.

The Meadowbrook Manor of Bolingbrook and the Center Home for Hispanic Elderly in Humboldt Park are reporting the most coronavirus deaths of any facility in the state; both have 26. Glenview Terrace and Symphony of Joliet have 25 deaths each.

As was the case last week, Ludeman Developmental Center in Park Forest is reporting the most cases in the state with 268 confirmed positives and six deaths. But that facility also has no new deaths this week and only three new cases.

In some cases, however, nursing homes took deaths and cases out of their count since last week. State officials have said adjustments can be made as deaths are investigated, and there could be mix-ups as the data passes from homes reporting to their local health departments, which then report to the state.

Seven facilities reported at least one fewer death than last week, amounting to 10 deaths taken out of the total count. Another combined 65 homes took a total of 444 cases off the board.

One home, Sheltered Village in Woodstock, reported 80 fewer total cases than last week, according to state data. Administrators at that facility weren’t available to clarify the data Friday evening.

Asked about lags and changes in reported deaths at his press briefing Friday, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said health officials regularly examine the data for errors or duplicates.

“Sometimes there could be a misspelled name, and maybe another report had a different name and so you would maybe count them twice and then after further review, you can see no, in fact, these are the same individuals,” Pritzker said. “So, again, there is some time that’s needed to re-look at the data to make sure that there aren’t errors.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Students who hadn’t seen each other since in-person classes ended abruptly in March amid the coronavirus outbreak commiserated over all they’ve missed out on, including the prom and a senior class trip.

Some also wondered about what they may have lost academically.

“Honestly, remote learning, I don’t think was my favorite thing,” said 18-year-old Isabella Branson. “It’s kind of hard to stay motivated when you don’t have anything to look forward to and you don’t see your friends.”

The small district in rural Georgia is among many around the U.S. that have pulled the plug on distance learning, all citing familiar reasons. It’s too stressful, the lack of devices and internet access is too much to overcome, and what students get from it just isn’t worth the struggle.

In Georgia, where the school year is ending early for one of every 10 students, many district leaders say the final weeks of the school year would have been dedicated anyway to preparing for and taking standardized tests that are now canceled. The governor and state schools superintendent who have moved to dismantle parts of Georgia’s high-stakes testing system have said they are not opposed to fewer instructional days.

“We didn’t cut any class time out,” Chattahoochee County High School Principal Josh Kemp said. “There was no reason to pile more on our parents and students.”

But Kemp and others also acknowledge that there was material that wasn’t covered and that teachers will have to find a way to fold it in next year for returning students.

“They weren’t able to get all the standards,” said Tammy Bailey, the science department chair at the high school. “I think there will be a gap.”

Classes had been scheduled to run through May 21 but remote instruction instead came to an end May 8 in the Chattahoochee County school district. A majority of the high school’s 450 students live on the U.S. Army’s sprawling Fort Benning, while a minority live around the small town of Cusseta. Only 59% of households in the district have access to broadband internet at home.

Other districts around the country that are ending the school year early including Omaha and some nearby suburban districts in Nebraska, Washington, D.C., and some in New Hampshire. Officials say they want to relieve stress on families, ease problems for students without internet access, and focus on preparing for a fresh start in the fall.

The last three weeks of school is “probably not prime instructional time,” said Andrew McEachin, an education policy researcher at RAND Corp. But he said that kids in struggling households may suffer most from being cut off from the normalcy of a school routine.

“I think the biggest thing about cutting a school year short is not what it does on average, but what it does on equity,” McEachin said. “Even if school isn’t working as well as we want it to be, that may be the best access low income students have to learning.”

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said on April 16 that he trusted schools to set their calendars and the following day, state Superintendent Richard Woods wrote that schools’ focus during the pandemic should “not be on test scores” but on making sure children are “healthy, safe and nurtured.”

But Michael O’Sullivan, executive director of GeorgiaCAN, a group that supports Georgia’s testing system, says this spring has been a preview of a “zero-accountability world.”

“It’s the easy way out of a very difficult situation, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to be good for kids,” O’Sullivan said.

Some schools in Georgia are making plans to combat academic losses from the year, such as beefed-up summer sessions. The Scintilla Charter Academy in Valdosta is aiming to start the next school year on July 23, to make up the time it lost when it ended on April 30.

Scintilla Dean of School Mandy Avera said her families were “stressed and overwhelmed” by online learning. The school covers kindergarten through sixth grade, and Avera is among educators who question whether younger children can successfully acquire critical skills like learning to read without a face-to-face interaction with a teacher.

“It just created a situation where we just can’t be as interactive as we like to be at Scintilla,” Avera said. “Kindergartners don’t understand why they’re at home. They don’t understand why they can’t go back to school and see their friends and see their teachers.”

Back in Cusseta, some seniors were stressing about being able to bring only four guests to a socially-distant graduation ceremony, while others were disregarding imposed distance to hug and gossip. But Chattahoochee County Superintendent Kristi Brooks was already trying to think about the next school year, despite uncertainty on whether in-person classes will resume.

The measures were enacted to help address a projected $90 million budget shortfall this year, university leadership said in a message to the Northwestern community.

“Even if we resume on-campus activity in the fall, as we hope to do by phases, we are likely to see a significant shortfall in the 2021 fiscal year as well, perhaps as great as or greater than what we are experiencing this year,” the note signed by President Morton Schapiro said.

University leaders will be taking a 10% to 20% cut in pay. A 5% automatic contribution and 5% matched contribution to retirement plans will be suspended. The 250 workers who are being furloughed are staff members who are unable to work remotely or whose workloads have been significantly reduced.

“We expect to see repercussions from the pandemic for some time. Most of our work involves bringing large numbers of people together — in classrooms, dormitories, hospitals, libraries, laboratories, meeting rooms, concert halls and athletic arenas. As such, a pandemic places extreme pressure on all our major functions and on associated revenue streams,” the message said.

The announcement comes weeks after the university announced other belt-tightening measures that included hiring restrictions, a pause on university travel and discretionary spending, and deferral of most facilities projects.

The university last month decided not to accept $8.5 million in federal stimulus money that it was allocated as part of the CARES Act — a decision that followed the lead of Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, Yale and Duke universities.

Some suburban districts have already started inviting families back through an appointment-based system, while Chicago Public Schools is working on a plan to let students pick up their personal belongings left at schools in March when it was still unclear how long buildings would be shut.

State Supt. of Education Carmen Ayala said schools are welcome to start allowing students to come by and pick up their possessions as long as proper social distancing is maintained.

“It has to be very well orchestrated for each school,” Ayala said in a Facebook live interview with State Rep. Emanuel Chris Welch.

“We really don’t want the social gatherings and the, ‘Goodbye, it’s the end of the school year,’ for obvious reasons,” she added. “But yes, absolutely, that is allowed. And I do know that schools are beginning to message that and plan and have those things occur.”

Chicago Public Schools spokeswoman Emily Bolton said the district is developing soon-to-be-released guidance on how the clean-outs will take place.

Whitney Young Magnet High School, for one, told families last week that students would be assigned a date and time starting this upcoming Monday through May 22 to retrieve their belongings, and social distancing protocols would be followed.

Many other CPS teachers and families were still waiting to hear how their schools will handle the issue.

Meanwhile in west suburban Plainfield, elementary school parents are required to make an appointment to pick up their student’s belongings, while middle school families will receive a bag that also includes a yearbook. High schoolers who aren’t graduating will be able to keep their possessions in their lockers until next school year or pick them up by appointment.

Staff at the three high schools at Maine Township District 207 in the northwest suburbs — Maine East, Maine South and Maine West — have been collecting items from locker rooms and putting them in bags or boxes tagged with each student’s name. Kids are then assigned a date and time to come by the school for pickup and to turn in textbooks, musical instruments, library books and other items.

“The response to COVID-19 has occurred in stages,” said Maine West Principal Eileen McMahon. “The materials pick-up is one of the final stages and it is bittersweet.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Members of several local groups gathered to share their concerns outside Dyett High School in Washington Park, the site of a 2015 hunger strike to protest the closure of the later reopened neighborhood school.

The coalition listed off its demands on grading, standardized testing, supports for homeless students, counseling services and other issues they saw as central to a quality education for students from low-income families.

Chicago Public Schools officials have already started to address at least some of the concerns. Standardized tests are canceled for this school year, and the district has handed out more than nine million meals since schools closed almost two months ago.

CPS has also passed out 102,000 laptops and tablets, reaching all but 13,000 kids who need them, and hopes to distribute the rest in the next two weeks.

But Alberta Reid, a CPS mother of two, said there needs to be permanent change, and there hasn’t been enough of a coordinated effort to address students’ unique challenges, such as what to do when a student has a laptop but no WiFi.

“Many of our families do not have access to internet,” Reid said. “This has made regular participation online difficult and impossible.”

The district also was distributing 12,000 hotspots with free internet access to students without permanent homes, but devices haven’t been available to other students because of a supply shortage.

CPS spokeswoman Emily Bolton said the district’s “number one priority is to support our families, students and staff during this unprecedented time and we are doing everything in our power to serve families to the best of our ability.”

The coalition of organizers demanded CPS hire more school counselors and special education teachers, become a “restorative justice district” that eliminates punitive police-involved discipline at schools and re-purpose permanently closed schools as housing and resource centers. They also want more teacher and student input on the plan for returning to school when it’s safe, and revised, no-fa grading policy that would see all students start at a 75% grade and move up with completed work.

Jitu Brown, a longtime South Side community organizer, said he’s seen black and brown students neglected for decades. That has continued during the pandemic, he says, with a “lack of preparation” by CPS to fully serve students’ learning needs and “no communication or engagement with the public around how schools should look when school reopens.”

“We cannot go back to the way it was,” Brown said. “We have to confront education equity as a real issue in the city of Chicago and a commitment, not just a soundbite, a commitment to transforming how education is delivered in this city.

“Mayor Lightfoot, we ask you not to take this personally. We ask you to take this as an urging to be different. Take this as an urging to not be the Chicago Machine, but to truly walk the progressive walk, not just talk the progressive talk.”

Rev. Robin Hood, a West Side activist, said officials should use this time to reimagine education, not only now, but in the future.

“Now is the time to change this,” Hood said. “We’re in the middle of a pandemic, which most of our communities have been in a pandemic for the last 50 years when it came to violence. We’ve been in a pandemic when it came to education.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The total cases include staff at district-run or charter schools or who work for outside vendors.

The district didn’t identify the two workers who passed away or say which jobs they held at which schools. Officials only said neither had recently been to a school building.

“With widespread community transmission in Chicago, the district’s number one priority has been keeping staff safe and healthy and our thoughts are with all members of the CPS community who have been impacted by this virus,” CPS spokeswoman Emily Bolton said in a statement.

All schools in Illinois have been closed since March 17 through an order by Gov. J.B. Pritzker. But hundreds of CPS schools have operated as food and laptop distribution centers during that time, with lunchroom workers passing out more than 10 million meals and administrators handing out 102,000 digital devices.

Of the 85 known cases, 38 are “essential employees” who were at a school at least once in recent weeks. The food and computer distribution programs at those schools were paused once the district was notified of the positive tests.

For the 38 cases that caused the temporary closures, signs were hung up on the front entrance of the buildings — but CPS didn’t send email notifications to parents, teachers or students at those schools. Officials also haven’t released a list of the schools.

The district at the end of March stopped notifying communities if someone at their school tested positive for the coronavirus. CPS officials pointed to the fact that, at that point, schools had been closed for two weeks — equal to the 14-day incubation period for the virus — and any new positive tests at that point would not have been contracted by in anyone in the building when schools were open.

The true impact on CPS’ 38,700 workers is undoubtedly much larger than currently known as Chicago reached 26,606 cases Tuesday with 1,068 deaths. As is generally the case, experts strongly suspect many more cases have gone unidentified in people who have recovered at home without being tested.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The newspaper studied about 120 longterm-care facilities listed by the state as having at least one resident who came down with the disease or died.

About 28% of the deaths from COVID-19 complications have happened in nursing homes with the lowest federal rating and only 6% in the facilities with the highest rating.

That disparity shows the state should focus testing and inspections in poorly rated nursing homes, experts said.

Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson said residents of poorly rated nursing homes should be transferred to field hospitals, like the one at McCormick Place, that have been built during the pandemic but haven’t been fully needed.

“Move people into temporary locations until we get a real good handle over this disease,” said Johnson, a Democrat from the West Side. “In this immediate crisis, I’m proposing using those facilities and transforming them into spaces so social distancing as well as other [U.S. Centers for Disease Control] guidelines can be maintained.”

The state should form a commission to study long-term improvements to nursing homes, he said.

As of Friday, 1,553 COVID-19 deaths in Illinois were tied to nursing homes — nearly half of the 3,241 deaths in the state from the disease, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health.

Nursing homes have captured the public’s attention in Illinois and nationally because of the large clusters of coronavirus cases appearing in many of them.

Last month, Gov. J.B. Pritzker vowed to step up testing at nursing homes, including those that don’t report any cases. He pledged to focus on nursing homes in minority communities, which have been hardest hit by the virus.

But the state hasn’t released details on testing in nursing homes, and the governor’s office didn’t reply to an email Friday asking for information about how that testing is being carried out.

As the death toll rises in nursing homes, they’ve become a target of labor unrest and lawsuits in recent weeks in Illinois.

SEIU Healthcare Illinois, a union with 10,000 workers in nursing homes — threatened to strike over wages but reached a tentative agreement Thursday with a proposed contract that includes a pay increase of $2 an hour for workers during the pandemic.

In Cicero, where nine coronavirus-related deaths have been reported at the City View Multi-Care Center, officials in the west suburb have sued the nursing home and state, saying they didn’t do enough to contain the disease.

City View Multi-Care is one of many poorly rated nursing homes that have become cauldrons of the coronavirus in Cook County.

The newspaper examined 122 nursing homes that have reported coronavirus cases or deaths and have received a quality rating from Medicare, which oversees and inspects them.

They have a combined average daily population of about 18,000 people.

Medicare gives one star to the worst-ranked nursing homes and five stars to the best.

The one-star nursing homes had 28% of all the coronavirus deaths and the two-star facilities had 30% of them.

In contrast, the five-star facilities had 6% of the deaths.

Measured a different way — the rates of deaths for the average daily populations of the nursing homes — the one- and two-star homes both had rates of nearly 5%, while the rate for the five-star homes was about 3%.

Tamara Konetzka, a professor and health economist in the Department of Public Health Services at the University of Chicago, says she has completed a similar study that looked at reported coronavirus cases and deaths at nursing homes in 11 states, including Illinois.

She also found higher death rates in the lower-ranked nursing homes in Cook County. Of all the places she evaluated, the disparity was the greatest in Cook County.

“It’s actually pretty dramatic . . . a meaningful magnitude of difference,” she says. “So in Cook County, we see this relationship between the star rating and the probability of having a case. But on average, across the states, there is a small relationship.”

Konetzka says she also found that nursing homes with larger minority populations were more likely to have a death or a reported case.

She says public-health officials need to focus their attention on the lowest-rated nursing homes in Cook County.

“I think they’re just less equipped than a five-star facility to put things in motion to protect their residents,” Konetzka says.

“It’s not like the other nursing homes probably don’t need help. But you know, we have to prioritize,” she says. “In terms of focusing resources, it’s got to be about testing and separation, whether that means moving patients elsewhere or limiting traffic between a COVID wing and a non-COVID area of the facility.”

Johnson points to one of those low-rated nursing homes — Westchester Health and Rehabilitation — as a place that needs intervention. The one-star facility had 47 reported coronavirus cases and 12 deaths — about 14% of its average population of residents.

“This one really jumped out,” Johnson says, adding that he had asked the governor to order a state inspection of the facility.

On Wednesday, Johnson held a news conference outside the Westchester nursing home to highlight its problems.

Afterward, a spokeswoman for the facility released a statement saying workers’ health was being evaluated after each shift, visits were being restricted to limit the spread of the virus and personal protective equipment was being provided.

Other low-rated nursing homes in Cook County have been found to have continuing problems during the pandemic.

For instance, during a COVID-19 focused inspection on April 14, Medicare and Medicaid inspectors found the one-star Bridgeview Health Care Center failed “to follow practices to contain the spread of COVID-19 by proper use of personal protective equipment and proper handling of clean and soiled linen.” Inspectors found no harm so far but a potential for “more than minimal harm.”

That nursing home has seen at least a dozen residents die of complications from the coronavirus — about 10% of its average daily population of 125 people.

Bridgeview’s administrator declined an interview request, saying by email that nine staff members have tested positive for the coronavirus.

Lynnette Jones, a cook at the nursing home, said she and other staffers have been given masks. She said she has no contact with residents, who no longer dine together in the dining room and have meals sent up on carts.

Still, as the mother of a daughter with asthma, she said she’s nervous. And she doesn’t know how many staffers have the virus.

“Hopefully, they’re trying to do the right thing for us,” Jones said. “But it’s scary going home to my daughter.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Ambrosio Medrano, convicted three times in corruption scandals, left prison this week as part of an effort to release inmates who are at-risk of contracting the coronavirus.

Federal Bureau of Prisons records show Medrano has been assigned to a residential re-entry management office in the Chicago area. Gal Pissetzky, the attorney who defended Medrano when he was sentenced in federal court six years ago, said Medrano is in a halfway house.

But for the rest of Medrano’s sentence, Pissetzky said, “he’s going to be on home confinement.” Medrano’s official release date isn’t until Sept. 14, 2025, prison records show.

A Bureau of Prisons spokesman said Medrano made the move Wednesday, transferring to “community confinement” from a federal prison camp in Duluth, Minnesota.

Pissetzky said prison officials identified Medrano, 66, as someone who met the criteria for compassionate release amid the coronavirus pandemic. He said Medrano did not file any paperwork with the Bureau of Prisons seeking the transfer.

Early in 2014, two federal judges presiding over separate cases handed Medrano a total of 13 years in prison over corrupt deals involving bribes and kickbacks.

Having already been handed a 2 ½-year sentence in the 1990s for accepting bribes on the City Council, a federal judge told Medrano he had pulled off an “unprecedented . . . corruption trifecta.”

Former Cook County Commissioner Joseph Mario Moreno, a co-defendant in one of Medrano’s cases, is also seeking compassionate release due to the coronavirus. Moreno is not due out of prison until January 2024.

As a commercial resort photographer, she travels over 100,000 miles each year, capturing luxurious images in places like Cabo and the Maldives.

So when the coronavirus started to spread and travel bans went into effect, Treimer was furloughed — for three months at least, and maybe longer.

“For the first time in three years, I wasn’t living on an airplane, you know? Whenever we were advised by the CDC to not travel, my world kind of flipped upside down,” she said. “I just started brainstorming: What am I going to do for the next three months? This is the first time in my life that I haven’t had a 9 to 5.”

Searching for normalcy and human connection, she decided to look for beauty elsewhere.

That’s how her project, “Stories from Six Feet,” came to be.

“Stories from Six Feet” is a photo series that documents the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting Chicago through the eyes of its residents in isolation. The project lives on Instagram under the handle @StoriesFromSixFeet.

Treimer has captured photos of over 100 individuals, couples and families all over the city. Each image is captioned with the subjects’ names, neighborhood and a paragraph about how they’re holding up.

Treimer said she hopes the photo series will encourage people to maintain the CDC’s recommendation for social distancing without sacrificing connection with other people.

Helena Kim and her partner live in a loft apartment on the top floor of a building in West Loop. When they agreed to have their photos taken by Treimer, they weren’t sure how she’d manage it without coming inside. To their surprise, Treimer showed up with a drone.

“She was just down there with her drone and her remote control and her car, and we were just kind of shouting back and forth, like, ‘Hey!’” Kim said. “I know some of my other neighbors kind of came out just to check what was going on.”

Treimer has taken photos of people in all different kinds of quarantine situations, from studios to high-rise buildings to single-family homes.

Sameka Gates, a seventh grade teacher and mom of two, was introduced to Treimer’s work by a friend at church. When she got her pictures back, she started crying.

“Even though right now everything is uncertain and we’re in a space where there’s a lot of hurt and pain, there is some time where people are just happy,” she said.

Quarantining together isn’t always easy. In addition to teaching her seventh grade students, Gates is homeschooling her kids due to school closures — forcing her to learn what they need to learn, too.

“I’m up early in the morning and go to bed really late; it’s busy, busy, busy,” she said.

Gates isn’t the only person who has opened up to Treimer about the struggles of keeping it together while stuck at home. Many of her subjects have shared their struggles with mental health amid the isolation.

“It’s kind of amazing just to see how open and vulnerable people are being with a complete stranger,” Treimer said.

The stories shared in tandem with each photo are central to the project’s mission.

“When you put a photo and a story together, it feels very personal,” Kim said. “It feels very much like, ‘Wow, this could have happened to my neighbor, or this could be anyone.’ It gives emotion to the photos and just kind of ties it all together to paint the bigger picture of what’s really happening.”

Treimer said she hopes to document the stories of at least one person in every neighborhood in Chicago before Gov. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order is lifted.

Some day, those photos and captions may be used to help tell the city’s story of surviving the COVID-19 pandemic. Treimer hopes the story’s message is clear.

“I want people to know that at one point in their lives, we were all unified by this,” Treimer said. “We were all together in something, and we all knew, together, that we were going to get through it.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

“It’s a troubling time for them,” Common said, “because they are the people who usually are overlooked.”

On Wednesday, his criminal justice reform organization Imagine Justice launched a campaign with dozens of advocacy and activist groups calling attention to the threat that the coronavirus pandemic poses on millions of men, women and youths who are incarcerated in the U.S.

The campaign, dubbed #WeMatterToo, is urging authorities to immediately release people who have served the vast majority of their sentences, especially if they have existing health conditions that put them at greater risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19. Although state and local correctional institutions have already released thousands of people from confinement due to the pandemic, supporters of the campaign also want governments to pay for testing and housing for inmates after they are released.

Common said he also hopes to create greater public awareness about what happens inside the nation’s jails and prisons and the impact that has on society.

“We all have unanswered questions about the pandemic,” the Grammy and Academy Award winning rapper said. “But being in prison adds new levels to that questioning, because of the way that people have been treated in prison.”

A two-minute video for the campaign features the voices of inmates who say jail officials are not providing protective equipment or requiring social distancing and have not regularly sanitized shower facilities. The video, shared with The Associated Press ahead of the campaign’s launch, does not identify the inmates or where they are imprisoned.

COVID-19 outbreaks in jails and prisons around the country have caused alarm among advocates, who say inadequate mitigation protocol threatens both the lives of incarcerated people and correctional officers. Last month, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons released data that showed more than 70% of people in federal custody tested for COVID-19 were positive.

Similarly dire outbreaks have been reported in a handful of state-run correctional systems.

In Common’s hometown of Chicago, where the Cook County Jail is one of the nation’s largest jails, a federal judge last month ordered officials to ensure social distancing among the 4,000 people in custody. As of Tuesday, 161 inmates and 81 correctional officers were positive for COVID-19, according to the sheriff’s department. Many more inmates have tested positive but recovered. Seven inmates who have tested positive have died.

Guaranteeing prisoners’ safety during the pandemic is an issue of humanity, not politics, said Sam Lewis, executive director of the California-based Anti-Recidivism Coalition, one of nearly 65 partner organizations in the #WeMatterToo campaign.

“People have made mistakes that put them in jail,” said Lewis, a former life prisoner. “But that does not mean they should just die in those places. Accountability is not a death sentence.”

Before the pandemic, Common’s Imagine Justice group organized regular in-person visits to correctional facilities. Since the pandemic, visitation has been cut off or is severely limited at many facilities.

“Some of the strongest people I’ve ever met are in prison,” Common said. “I believe we can come out of this greater than we were before.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

But through the lens of the coronavirus pandemic that originated in China and is now hitting the U.S., being painted as a foreign enemy has become all too familiar. Hundreds of Asian Americans have reported verbal and physical assaults since the nation’s first infections surfaced in January. Even in cities with large Asian communities, people have hurled century-old slurs like “Chinaman.”

Daniel Dae Kim, a Korean American actor known for TV’s “Lost” and “Hawaii Five-0,” faced racist trolling when he shared his COVID-19 diagnosis on Instagram in March. Kim, who narrates the documentary with actress Tamlyn Tomita, has recovered and feels “back to 100%.”

“It’s been very eye-opening to see how much prejudice still exists in America and how deep seated it seems to be. But it’s part of the price one pays for speaking out, even against something as seemingly universal as injustice,” Kim said in an email to The Associated Press.

The five-episode series airing between Monday and Tuesday is a sweeping look at Asian Americans’ impact on society, politics and pop culture from the mid-19th century through 9/11. Produced by Asian American filmmakers, the show features reflections from U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, “Fresh Off the Boat” star Randall Park and a host of people from other industries. There are also interviews with descendants whose family stories are heavily featured.

May is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, when Asians’ contributions to the American landscape are often highlighted.

The virus-related attacks, however, have been a stark reminder of how quickly Asian Americans can go from neighbor to scapegoat. In a Los Angeles Times editorial last month, Korean American actor John Cho wrote how “belonging is conditional. One moment we are Americans, the next we are all foreigners, who ‘brought’ the virus here.”

That anti-Asian sentiment is all the more reason the documentary needs to be seen now, Kim said.

“Those who forget history are condemned to repeat it,” Kim said. “Asian Americans have a unique history in America. It’s one that should be celebrated as an indispensable part of our nation’s history.”

Renee Tajima-Peña, a series producer and professor of Asian American studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, had the monumental task of deciding how to fit decades of history into just five hours. She began with the arrival of Chinese railroad workers in the 1800s.

“We start at a time where we can still find people, if they’re descendants, with pictures and photographs,” Tajima-Peña said. “On the one hand, there was choosing which stories we felt were most important to tell. On the other hand, it’s TV. We have to make sure it’s something that’s watchable and the audience can engage with.”

The series covers well-known events like the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the World War II internment of Japanese Americans and the 1982 beating death of Vincent Chin in Detroit.

But it also delves into lesser-known moments, like a 1965 labor strike organized by Filipino farmworkers in California, and spotlights people you may not recognize, like Patsy Mink, a Japanese American who in 1964 was the first woman of color elected to Congress.

There’s also an interview with Tereza Lee, who inspired the now-stalled DREAM Act that would have given a path to citizenship for young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children.

Comedian Hari Kondabolu, known for his documentary “The Problem With Apu,” speaks in the series about post-9/11 treatment of Muslim Americans and Southeast Asian Americans. The coronavirus-related racism has drawn comparison to that time.

Like Kondabolu did in 2001, many young Asian Americans are now facing outright hate for the first time.

“I had never been targeted the way I had been in 9/11. That shaped how I viewed this country,” he said at a virtual town hall last week. “The generation after 9/11 ... they’re gonna have to question where we are now. It’s going to inform how they will see the world.”

He’s glad that the challenges and prejudices Asian Americans have faced for more than a century are enshrined in a documentary.

“Once it’s on PBS, it feels like an official document,” Kondabalu said in an earlier interview. “This marks our place in the history of this country. It wasn’t there before.”

Tajima-Peña wouldn’t alter the episodes to address the pandemic if she could, saying viewers will inevitably connect it to present-day xenophobia. It’s a “new story that really is an old story.”

“The whole COVID crisis, it’s really just amplified all the fault lines in the United States of race and class, poverty, health care. In terms of Asian Americans, of course, it’s this idea we’re so-called foreigners,” she said.

One of her hopes is the series will inspire younger Asian Americans to think beyond social media rants to activism.

“Our backs are against the walls. How do we move forward together? That’s what you see in the series,” Tajima-Peña said. “Asian Americans had to come together to defend our own rights.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The Food Network’s overall ratings in April were up 25 percent over the same month last year, while HGTV was up 22 percent, the Nielsen company said.

Both networks have adjusted programming in reaction to coronavirus shutdowns with more in the works. The Food Network’s Guy Fieri has gotten takeout at some of his favorite dives, and other chefs are exploring how to be creative with what’s in the pantry. HGTV is planning a show where new products are left on the doorway of people and design experts will judge how the family made use of them, said Kathleen Finch, chief lifestyle brand officer for the Discovery-owned networks.

“People are gravitating to our networks and talent because we provide more than entertainment right now,” Finch said.

Stuck-at-home show hosts are also making use of camera equipment lent by their networks. Comic Amy Schumer is making a program that debuts Monday for the Food Network, “Amy Schumer Learns to Cook,” that is being filmed by her nanny, Finch said.

HGTV hit paydirt this month with shows that featured Brad Pitt, Melissa McCarthy and other celebrities improving the living situations for people they know. The network is planning a show that will feature comics sitting around and commenting on episodes of “Househunters,” Finch said.

But quite a few intelligent young people are not taking the virus seriously. They continue to go out and gather in large groups. It’s a serious threat to their well-being and that of their families and friends.

I’m not here to scold, but I hope my experience can help you young people consider why we need to take serious precautions to protect ourselves, our families and our communities.

I was born during the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918. My sister died in the epidemic. I doubt my mother ever recovered from that loss. Yet, my mother went on, living another half-century despite health problems, the Great Depression and World War II.

Opinion

Mother was just one generation removed from slavery. In 1919, she and my father moved the family from Alabama to Chicago to escape Jim Crow and racist terror. All three of her surviving children became well-educated. My brother and I fought in the U.S. Army in World War II and became decorated veterans.

Battles are not won in weeks

Now we’re going to have to fight this pandemic as hard as we fought back then. The president has claimed the virus will magically disappear any day now. In reality, no historic battle is won in a few days or weeks. It’s a good thing he wasn’t president during World War II or you’d all be speaking German right now, and I wouldn’t be speaking at all.

They call my age group the Greatest Generation because we fought in World War II. But now, in my old age, I believe you young people will have to be the new Greatest Generation.

I am infuriated by the dismissive attitude of certain politicians towards older Americans. Especially now, as we seniors are threatened by this virus, they act like we are expendable. But we have as much right to be here, living our lives, as anyone else.

My contemporaries and I have a vast reserve of talent, ideas and positive experiences. We have been change-makers, and we are not done yet. Talk to your own grandparents if you are fortunate enough to have them with you. Ask them what they’ve been through.

It’s not enough to respect your elders. You’ve also got to protect them. Make sure they have what they need, but keep your distance for the time being. Follow the advice of scientists and doctors: Stay home, wash your hands, cover your face, and so on, to prevent spreading the virus. To practice these rules is a form of resistance to historic injustice.

Back in World War II, we made a united effort to defeat our enemies. The future of democracy was at stake. Every family sacrificed. We saved cans to be turned into ammunition. We grew vegetables in every yard. Butter, meat, sugar, coffee and other necessities were rationed to send to the troops overseas. We looked out for each other.

We united even though we were still segregated inside the Army. We said among ourselves, “We’ll solve that problem once we get back home.”

Protecting everyone — and our election

I’m proud of the young people who are now organizing on the South Side, delivering food and supplies to those in need. They are acting with purpose and leadership.

Besides our elders, we must protect those who have been locked up. We on the outside should be demanding protection for them. We’ve got to treat them fairly, and with all due haste, release as many as possible, get them access to healthcare and make sure they are housed.

I worry, too, that the president may seize this opportunity to delay or even prevent the national elections next fall. We need a national system of alternative methods for voting, such as mail-in ballots. I remain optimistic that we can mobilize the electorate and defeat the incumbent.

Our great cause in the days of my youth was the defeat of tyranny worldwide. It took an international effort. Every young person came forward. We did it then and we can defeat this enemy today.

At 101, I’ve been lucky to live beyond the typical lifespan. I hope we can inspire each other, and stay politically alert and active.

We know that those numbers are only a fraction of the families that have been impacted by the virus. Many more are losing income, having hours reduced, getting sick or being forced to choose between getting sick and getting a paycheck.

Magdalena Zylinska, a single mother who works cleaning houses in Chicago, has to choose between continuing to work and put food on the table or staying home to keep her 12-year-old son safe. “I can’t even sleep at night, to figure out which bills to pay or not pay,” she says.

Opinion

First-generation college student Arica Kincheloe lost the jobs that she relied on to pay her tuition at the University of Chicago. While many schools have shifted to online classes, students remain burdened with the same tuition costs that many of them already struggled to pay.

At the end of March, Congress passed the CARES Act, providing for a $1,200 stimulus payment to most Americans. It is clear that this one-time stimulus is not enough to meet Americans’ needs. We must establish monthly payments and we must increase the amount of money received to help people like Magdalena and Arica make ends meet for the length of the COVID-19 crisis.

The economic impact of the crisis have been especially bad for people of color who are disproportionately risking their lives in jobs that cannot be done remotely. More than half of African Americans under 45 have lost their jobs or seen a reduction in work and wages since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Young people, early in their careers and often lacking seniority and the job protections of earlier generations, also are severely affected.

While the new unemployment benefits Congress passed in the first CARES Act are beginning to give millions of people a needed financial boost, we must do more to help Illinois families.

Even before the current pandemic, 40% of Americans were one missed paycheck away from disaster. No one should ever be one crisis away from poverty, but for a large percentage of American families, that is the reality. We are seeing the impact of this economic vulnerability play out over and over again as our nation struggles through these challenging times.

The fastest and most effective way to help the families in Illinois harmed by economic impacts of COVID-19 is with direct cash payments. Millions of people in Illinois have already received their one-time $1,200 CARES Act stimulus check. For many, this stimulus is a lifeline, allowing residents to pay bills that they’ve lost sleep over or to purchase groceries, replenishing cabinets that were looking increasingly bare. $1,200 is a good start, but it’s not nearly enough. The average rent for an apartment in Chicago is nearly $2,000 per month. The $1,200 stimulus wouldn’t even cover one month of rent for most families.

We need bigger, bolder policies to help people — recurring payments that last until the economy recovers and it is safe to return to work. My colleagues and I are pushing for legislation that would establish payments of $2,000 a month for adults and $1,000 for children. These payments would include college students and other adult dependents, and families with one or more members who file taxes using an Individual Tax Identification Number.

We know that the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will be felt for years to come. Many are predicting the crisis will last well into 2021, or beyond. Now is not the time for timid solutions. We must take the steps necessary to not only keep our small businesses afloat, but also to keep our families afloat.

Direct payments are an essential tool to help families solve their own problems and to provide resiliency and stability. In the next relief bill, we must step up and ensure that there are no more one-time, Band-Aid solutions for families. Let’s make sure that Illinois families receive monthly payments to give them the financial security they need to ride out this crisis.

This is happening now to poor families involved with the Department of Children and Family Services.

Since March, when the COVID-19 pandemic intensified, children who were taken from their parents by DCFS have not been allowed to have supervised visits with each other or their siblings. In a blanket order, DCFS banned all supervised visits between children, parents, and siblings.

Opinion

Banning supervised visits significantly harms the bond between parent and child and sets vulnerable families up for failure.

As the Cook County public defender, I represent nearly 3,000 parents whose families are DCFS-involved. My clients are poor, and most are parents of color. The visitation ban has negatively impacted already fragile families depriving them of much needed time to bond and stay bonded with their children.

Many parents have very young children who cannot communicate via phone or video conferencing, and because of this ban they are deprived of the opportunity to see, touch and hold their young children. Even mothers who breastfeed their infant children are prevented from doing so.

The Children’s Bureau of the United States Department of Health and Human Services has provided guidance on how foster care cases should be handled during this crisis. The Children’s Bureau explained that child protection courts should continue with their mission of reuniting families and doing the business of child welfare agencies.

As the Children’s Bureau has advised:

“Family time is important for child and parent well-being, as well as for efforts toward reunification. Family time is especially important during times of crisis. The Children’s Bureau strongly discourages the issuance of blanket orders that are not specific to each child and family that suspend family time; doing so is contrary to the well-being and best interest of children, may contribute to additional child trauma, and may impede the likelihood of reunification.”

Gov. J.B. Pritzker was one of the first leaders in Illinois to point out that COVID-19 has affected African American families more than any other population in the nation. This DCFS order disproportionately affects African Americans, causing more children to be separated from their biological parents and siblings, aggravating an already tragic and dire crisis in the community. The order serves to worsen the fabric of economically depressed and medically underserved African American communities.

Denying family contact is a horrible misplaced priority that should not be part of our state’s policy. Included in permissible activities during Pritzker’s stay-at-home order are playing golf, purchasing cannabis, getting take-out food and going to a hardware store, yet poor families are banned from visiting their children. This is not acceptable.

Supervised visits can be done in a safe way, like all the other acceptable activities permitted during the shelter-in-place order. If we can safely prepare and distribute food, we can safely allow parents and their children to visit one another.

Whenever a crisis hits, it is the most vulnerable among us that are hit the hardest. It doesn’t have to be that way.

Every afternoon around 4 o’clock, I walk the dog. She needs to maintain her relationship with fire hydrants, grass and foliage, and I desperately need to get out of the house. I am never without a mask, even though they fog up my glasses and I look like a befuddled, inappropriately dressed surgeon who got lost on his way to the OR.

Opinion

It seemed like quite a lot of you wore them at first, but gradually many of you stopped. I don’t know if this is because you’re unable to grasp the notion that their purpose is to protect others (and to an extent, you) or because the Insta vendors ran out of cool colors or because you’re too vain to allow a mask to obscure your Look-At-Me-I’m-Like-So-Hot-I-Can’t-Stand-It facial features.

Some of you even persist in walking down the middle of the sidewalk, so it is I who must scurry into the street to achieve the mandatory 6-foot distance. My dog isn’t wild about that either. She prefers grass to pavement.

As for you maskless joggers — do you not realize that your heavier than normal exhalations are sending a virtually continuous Hollywood spit take into the atmosphere? The sun is out, but it’s raining horizontally.

Here’s the thing. If one of you gives it to me, I could give it to five of your friends before I take that scenic ride in the COVID-19 freezer truck.

I used to think I was invincible too until I got a godawful case of the Swine Flu when I was 25 and spent a week crawling to the bathroom, eating carpet pile on the way and asking my friends if they knew any weed dealers who sold cyanide.

Guess what? COVID-19 is a LOT worse than Swine Flu. I know a 21-year-old guy — no health problems, works out, even eats kale — who got it, and he said the misery was so intense it felt like an invisible psychotic wearing steel-toed boots was kicking every inch of his body incessantly for two weeks while holding his head in a convection oven set on “BAKE.” Also, his lungs had made it clear that they would prefer to live outside of his body.

Here’s another unpleasant surprise for you. Where I live, in Los Angeles, almost three times as many people between 0 and 40 have been testing positive than the over-65 group. Sure, we senior types croak more often, but the rising ratios don’t look so great for you, either.

Which is not to say that my generation is perfect. Far from it. For starters, we destroyed the planet, which, granted, was kind of a screw-up. And those who occupy the seats in the cretin section of our age group don’t wear masks, either.

But most of us who do wear masks don’t think we’re invincible anymore, and we’ve been around long enough to know that you’re not, either. I realize it’s hard for a 20-year-old to imagine, but one day, just like us, the topics that will inevitably creep into your conversations will be about colonoscopies, MRIs and the heartbreak of psoriasis.

Granted, it’s wonderful to feel invincible. Cherish it while it lasts, but don’t push your luck — wear the damn mask.

But for some Americans, the ongoing COVID-19 crisis intersects with another long-standing pandemic: our nation’s ongoing gun epidemic and weak gun laws, creating unique challenges that Congress must address as it contemplates a fourth stimulus measure.

In fact, while public mass shootings may have fallen in the months of COVID-19, everyday gun violence, violence that results from domestic abuse, suicides, and unintentional shootings may be increasing. Data analyzed by Guns Down America from the Gun Violence Archive shows that nationally, fatalities from gun violence increased 14 percent in the first two weeks of April this year compared to the same period last year. Firearm fatalities rose by over 10 percent when compared to the first half of April 2018.

Opinion

In Chicago, the police department is reporting a double-digit increase in gun incidents compared to this time last year, forcing community organizations like Chicago Cred to fight two public health crises simultaneously: preaching violence reduction in hotspots throughout the city while delivering basic goods and education to communities in need. Philadelphia is similarly experiencing a 17 percent increase in shootings compared to this time last year; and in Baltimore, gun incidents increased so dramatically toward the end of March that Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young begged residents to “put down the guns.”

Many city leaders fear that shootings may increase further once lockdowns are lifted and the weather improves.

Simultaneously, at least 142 American cities and counties in 48 states are reporting significant spikes in calls to domestic violence hotlines, and we’re reading heartbreaking media reports of COVID-related homicides, unintentional shootings and multiple homicide suicides connected to the stress, anxiety, and economic hardship of the current pandemic. As three doctors recently observed in the Annals of Internal Medicine, America is “a society now primed for a suicide epidemic triggered by COVID-19.”

Their prediction rings even more true in light of media reports of panic-fueled gun purchases and FBI data showing that federally licensed gun dealers requested one million more background checks in March of 2020 than they did in March of 2019.

A spike in gun deaths is not inevitable; Congress can save thousands of lives if it addresses the consequences of the coronavirus gun violence surge by adding key provisions to the next stimulus measure.

First, lawmakers should provide additional funding to the FBI to process the surge in background checks we’re experiencing. After all, the FBI conducted a record 3,740,688 background checks in March of 2020, including the highest single day on record on March 20, with 210,208 checks. In March of 2019, an FBI official admitted to Congress that the current background check system was already strained, with the bureau having to pull staff from other departments in order to handle surges in requests.

Congress should close the Charleston loophole once and for all. The loophole, which allows gun dealers to sell firearms when the FBI is unable to complete a background check in three days, permitted a white supremacist to obtain a gun and assassinate nine people at the Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, South Carolina in 2015. More than 270,000 background checks are not completed in this three-day-window each year, resulting in thousands of individuals, whose background checks later revealed they were prohibited from owning firearms, accessing deadly weapons.

Every 16 hours, an American woman is fatally shot by a current or former intimate partner, a horrific statistic that will likely worsen as tens of thousands of women remain stuck at home with their abusers during a period of intense and unprecedented emotional and economic anxiety. A bipartisan group of senators and representatives have already requested additional funding for domestic violence services. Congress should appropriate such funds and extend additional dollars to suicide prevention to ensure that law enforcement, domestic service providers and the courts are able to coordinate and provide safety to those at risk.

Our lawmakers must also extend federal grants to frontline gun violence intervention workers serving communities already disproportionately impacted by the virus. Congress must recognize that evidence-based intervention initiatives are essential for ending cycles of violence and, during these trying times, virus spread.

Finally, gun violence prevention advocates and gun enthusiasts agree that the surge in first-time gun buyers rushing out to purchase firearms in the midst of a national health pandemic (without first receiving the proper training) will lead to more instances of unintentional shootings and other gun tragedies. Lawmakers must provide funding for public education efforts around the danger of untrained individuals bringing something far more deadly into their home than coronavirus and the importance of safe gun storage.

Unless Congress acts, for far too many people the thing that cuts their lives short won’t be coronavirus, but a gun.

Among them are so-called “third places” — the restaurants, bars, gyms, houses of worship, barber shops and other places we frequent that are neither work nor home.

The third place is a concept in sociology and urban planning that recognizes the role these semi-public, semi-private places play in fostering social association, community identity and civic engagement. In giving people a familiar setting for social interaction among regulars, they encourage “place attachment” — the bond between a person and a place.

Opinion

Now, experiencing the coronavirus from the fortress of our living spaces, we may enjoy being in a haven. But we’ve lost the social and psychological intimacy of third places.

It‘s a significant loss. My three decades of research on urban spaces finds that both public spaces and third places contribute to a healthy, flourishing society.

Third spaces have probably always existed. From social clubs and religious gatherings to neighborhood festivals and burial societies, people have long formed associations bringing groups together.

Most of these associations reflected genealogical, religious, gender, cultural or class homogeneity. Often, they were formed to fulfill a social function, like raising funds. They were not necessarily located in a particular place.

Contemporary third places, in contrast, are always space-based. When urbanists use the term, they’re referring to a physical setting with a boundary or entrance designed to allow, even encourage, access to a variety of people — like a coffee shop with a bright sign and an open door.

Staff and regulars are part of the scene. But so are strangers. While not as diverse or accessible as public spaces, third places rely on a certain amount of heterogeneity to convey social importance and bring vitality.

In this way, third places complement public spaces like parks, plazas, playgrounds, streets and sidewalks — free and open places that offer contact, cooperation and even conflict with a range of mostly unknown people.

If public spaces expand our social relationships and liberalize our world view, third places anchor us to a community where we are recognized and our needs accommodated. Third places are predictable and comfortable, a setting where we feel “at home.”

‘It is not the same’

Those sheltering in place are now missing their third places acutely.

Recently, I spoke with some young men who are still gathering in a local state park near my home. They were sharing a pizza, hidden from view. They told me how hard it is not to be able to hang out at the pizza shop itself. It was their third place.

Grace, an older friend from Manhattan, told me she feels “cut off” because she can’t go to the neighborhood restaurant where she knows the chef by name and enjoys sitting at the bar after work.

I still get coffee every morning at the Golden Pear on the east end of Long Island, where I live, wearing a mask and gloves. Normally, I’d eat breakfast there while exchanging greetings and conversing in English and Spanish with friends and staff.

Now I take my coffee to an empty beach to drink. It is not the same.

As my colleague Judy Ling Wong observes, from London, where she lives alone, this lockdown is a time of “severe disorientation.”

Phoning friends has almost a “ritualistic feel to it,” she writes. It is “done to maintain our hold on social connections.”

Gated against coronavirus

Our collective loneliness during the pandemic exposes how dependent we are on one another for happiness and how interconnected we really are.

Healthy societies depend on continuing interaction among people who are different in multiple ways. Third places are prime venues for such interactions because our shared enjoyment — a love of coffee, music, or working out — assures that even strangers have at least one thing in common.

I have studied people who live in gated communities, places bereft of such diverse interactions. Even in a supposedly secured space, they worry about crime and feel anxiety when they walk outside the gates of their neighborhood. Children who grow up in such places learn, implicitly or intentionally, to fear those outside the walls, including their own families’ workers, nannies or delivery people.

Because of the potential of contagious strangers, the coronavirus creates a similar us-versus-them mentality. Without third places and public spaces where people come into regular contact with others outside their circle, such thinking can become ingrained. It can metastasize from prudent public health advice to paranoia and prejudice.

The coronavirus challenges not only our physical, mental and economic health but also our social health.

Third places provide the daily glue that binds us to a particular location and the people who frequent it. With them, we construct a chosen community, a broader public realm. Without them, I worry, the associations that weave a complex society together will fray.

Why are the poorest African American neighborhoods that have been plagued by violence now the hardest hit by the coronavirus?

We think these problems have common roots and common solutions.

Gov. J. B. Pritzker issued a statewide shelter-in-place order five weeks ago in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Since that time, Chicago has had over 20,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 873 virus-related deaths. In that same time period, at least 294 people have been shot and 55 people have been killed in Chicago, placing the city on pace for roughly the same number of shootings and killings as in 2018 and 2019.

Opinion

The virus and violence have race and poverty in common. African Americans comprise roughly 30% of Chicago’s population but make up nearly half of its poor residents and 80% of its homicide victims.

Similarly, blacks represent at least 40% of Chicago’s coronavirus cases and 55% of its pandemic-related deaths. Part of this overrepresentation can be explained by black Chicagoans’ disproportionate rates of chronic health conditions, employment in “essential” economic sectors, reliance on public transportation and uninsurance, all of which increase one’s chances of infection and severe symptomatology.

But another key link between violence and the virus are large numbers of alienated young people on Chicago’s South and West Sides. Like in many other places, young people are ignoring the stay-at-home and social-distancing orders coming from elected officials, heightening the risk of viral infection and transmission. In Chicago, these young people are often the same ones involved in the city’s rampant gun violence that has persisted throughout the pandemic.

Our research with gang members in Chicago over the last 20 years indicates that today’s gang wars are vendettas driven by young people facing desolate circumstances and few, if any, meaningful prospects for a better life.

In other areas of the world, organized crime groups have stepped in to respond to the pandemic, filling voids left by the retreat of the state. In Mexico and southern Italy, drug cartels and Mafia groups are distributing packages of food to desperate residents. In the favelas of Brazil, drug gangs are imposing a curfew and South African gangs have organized peace treaties and are providing community aid.

Chicago, however, has no such organized gangs, particularly in its black neighborhoods, where the monolithic gangs of the 1980s and 1990s have shattered into small, hyperlocal, horizontally organized cliques. There has been no organized response to the pandemic from these groups, since they lack the organization and resources to form any such response. The old gang days are over, and the new cliques are hanging out as usual.

What is needed on Chicago’s South and West Sides, however, is not more organized gangs; it is a more legitimate and benevolent state. The desperate conditions in these communities that are driving both the gun violence and coronavirus crises have been caused by decades of private sector abandonment and a public sector that has largely abdicated its role in ensuring people’s welfare in favor of policing and incarcerating.

The public response should not be to lock these youth up in death traps like Cook County Jail, but to invest in the South and West Sides to give these youth essential resources, hope, and a reason to live. Mayor Lightfoot’s INVEST South/West proposal would do much to reverse decades of city abandonment in these communities, but without explicit protections for current residents, these efforts are likely to result in rent intensification and displacement for their targeted beneficiaries.

A broad-based public employment initiative is perhaps the most desperately needed intervention in communities where Depression-era levels of unemployment existed even before the pandemic — and are doubtlessly much worse now. The relative disorganization of today’s gangs and their often-marginal involvement in the illicit drug economy greatly enhances the potential success of such an initiative. Importantly, however, such a program wouldn’t be limited to these communities and would likely enjoy widespread support given the broader economic devastation wreaked by the coronavirus pandemic.

While the City of Chicago and State of Illinois should marshal whatever resources possible toward this end, they should also demand of their counterparts in Washington — both current and hopeful — that a robust federal response is needed. The recent $3 trillion stimulus proves that funding is no valid obstacle — that where there is a will, there is a way.

Let’s exert the pressure needed to create that will and tackle not only the current coronavirus pandemic, but the ongoing gun violence crisis as well.

As spring turns to summer and then fall, and we’re be able to take fuller stock of the devastation, we’ll know which industries came out stronger, which need to reinvent themselves, and which unfortunately will never come back. With the benefit of hindsight, one thing that will be made abundantly clear is the need for organized labor in times of crisis.

Opinion

In late March, when Gov. J.B. Pritzker issued stay-at-home restrictions for Illinois residents and required most operations to close, he exempted essential businesses and encouraged them to remain open. Construction workers, many of whom were building hospitals, long-term care facilities and other vital infrastructure, were asked to stay on the job.

The hardworking men and women of the Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters answered the call. This was not a decision members took lightly. They knew of the health risks involved with projects such as converting McCormick Place into a 3,000-bed alternate care facility. But, as our members said, “Sometimes you have look past yourself.”

But it’s not just a sense a duty compelling the thousands of union carpenters doing their part to help contain the spread. They go to work knowing their union has their back every step of the way. Among the many lessons we will learn from the COVID-19 pandemic is its demonstration of the importance of union membership for essential workers.

Of all the injustices exposed by the pandemic, the risks faced by non-union workers have become the most apparent. Non-union workers are being asked to risk their safety with little or no protections of their own. This is why we’re seeing a groundswell of strikes and walk-offs from delivery drivers and other workers on the front lines.

The construction industry is no different. Many non-union construction workers do not have health insurance — about 54%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Because they often are paid under the table, non-union workers also can struggle to access unemployment benefits. Their unemployment insurance, Social Security and other benefits are not withheld from their paychecks.

Compare the experience of non-union construction workers with what building trades unions across the country are providing for their members. The Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters has a dedicated safety department and staff working round the clock answering questions and visiting job sites to make sure they are compliant with CDC health and safety guidelines. We’ve also extended health insurance eligibility for members who lost coverage due to a reduction of hours worked and are providing 100% coverage for testing, office visits, ER and urgent care visits relating to COVID-19, among other benefit adjustments.

Our number one priority will always be fighting tooth and nail for our members. We’ve been doing that since 1881 and will never let up.

It’s important to remember that union efforts don’t just benefit the members we represent. Unions raise wages for everyone, especially the middle-class. A recent study done by researchers from the Illinois Economic Policy Institute, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and University of California, Irvine found that labor unions boost worker incomes by lifting hourly wages by an average of 11%.

The Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters is proud of our record of service, protecting our members’ health and welfare, and raising the standard of living for the middle class. We look forward to new members joining the union movement and having a collective voice.

While we’re strong alone, we’re unstoppable together.

The COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented, but the families who endured the Civil War would see some parallels between their experiences and ours.

Indeed, social distancing has unintentionally made our society into something the Civil War generation would have recognized: one clearly based on the household.

Opinion

Maintaining the household was always the chief priority for 19th Century families, but the absence of many fathers, husbands and brothers on the Civil War battlefront made it an even more pressing responsibility. This empowered the women left behind, but it also created a sense of being cut off from the rest of the world — a feeling we can certainly relate to today.

Like us, they knew that monumental events were taking place and decisions were being made that could profoundly affect their lives. However, they had far fewer ways to learn about what was happening outside their immediate communities.

We benefit from a vast technological network designed to bring us information. This flood of data from competing sources can seem overwhelming and make us anxious about our constantly changing landscape. This anxiety would have been even greater for Civil War Americans, who similarly did not know what the crisis would bring but also had more trouble gathering even basic information about it.

Newspapers were their greatest conduit to the outside world, but details were sometimes slow to arrive. Knowing a battle had been fought often wasn’t enough because it didn’t address their main concern. That came later — with the casualty lists. Families could wait days, or even weeks, to discover if loved ones had fallen in combat. For some, due to the lack of forensic science, it took until the end of the war to see if Johnny came marching home.

So, like us, Civil War Americans often found themselves isolated and uncertain.

Fortunately, their households also provided them with distractions and other ways to alleviate those conditions. Without modern appliances and technology, running the household was a laborious task — even more so with some family members off at the front. Kids had other amusements too, like games and toys — some purchased, but others made for them by relatives and friends.

Middle class families also participated in “parlor culture.” They would gather in the parlor — a room set aside solely for cultural pursuits — and read together, sing songs and play piano, or do various other activities that interacted with the broader culture and enriched their minds. In fact, the war itself influenced many of these activities. People bought games that simulated aspects of the war and sang songs that helped emotionally and intellectually make sense of the conflict raging around them.

Households reached outward during the Civil War and tried to help however they could. Basic tasks like knitting had always been prominent features of home life but became something more. Women knitted socks and garments for soldiers, along with other supplies that could be manufactured in the home.

Soldier health also became a focus. Women volunteered as nurses and people gave financial support to national organizations designed to promote mental and physical health in the armies. Mary Lincoln herself visited hospitals to cheer patients, and both she and the president supported organizations that helped soldiers. We can see parallels between these efforts and ours to sew masks and donate gloves for healthcare providers or find other ways to help “flatten the curve.”

Civil War families also provided psychological comfort to their loved ones in the ranks by constantly writing letters and sending care packages. They may not have had the internet or phones, but it’s not difficult to envision this flood of letters — many of which remain with us today in repositories like the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library — as akin to text messages and emails.

For some families, the quantity of these letters far outstripped anything else they sent in their lifetimes — something we can also identify with, as social distancing motivates us to reach out via technology to family and friends we sometimes took for granted.

Human beings crave community and, even in the most trying of times, seek it out. Each Civil War household was a community unto itself, but members of those households also found ways to connect themselves with the broader community around them. Our crisis is of a different sort, but we can find inspiration and comfort in the sacrifices they made and the ingenuity they showed.

These budgets can surpass $2 million for schools like the University of Tennessee.

Is it worth it?

I study economics. Research I recently did shows just how big the payoff for spending money to recruit the best players can be.

Opinion

Half a million dollars

The schools that secure five-star recruits — the 30 or so players judged to be in the top one-hundreth of the top 1% of high school football players — can increase total revenue by over $500,000 for a university’s athletic department. Most football teams never secure a five-star recruit. Others, such as the University of Alabama and Louisiana State University, recruit three or four every year.

My research team came to this $500,000 figure by linking 10 years’ worth of football recruiting information from Rivals.com and Scout.com, two of the top recruiting services for prospective college football players, with federal data on how much colleges take in and spend on athletics, win-loss records for individual schools and post-season bowl appearances.

The data shows revenue and expenditures for each sport separately, which made it possible to determine what a football recruit added to football revenue at each university.

Schools like the University of Oklahoma, the University of Michigan and Notre Dame, which on average bring in over a dozen four- or five-star recruits every year, bring in millions of dollars more in revenue when they land more of the top recruits in a given year.

For instance, my estimates suggests that Clemson University’s five-star recruits, of which there were five, and 12 four-star recruits — also in top one-quarter of 1% of all players — in the 2020 recruiting class will increase the school’s football revenue by well over $3 million, well above its $1.8 million recruiting budget.

The reason is simple: Top recruits help teams win.

Since a top recruit correlates strongly with increases in the number of victories, they help determine the type of post-season play. Five-star recruits are not the deciding factor in whether a school gets to a bowl game, the mark of a winning season — the big-time programs will have winning records every year without fail.

But they do push them to the upper echelon of post-season play — the College Football Playoffs or its forerunner, the Bowl Championship Series. Reaching the championship level in college football contributes to lucrative broadcast contracts, corporate partnerships and even more successful recruiting.

Very few schools are consistently successful in the race to recruit top football talent and win at the highest levels. Just as nine schools have been responsible for 20% of all players drafted into the NFL over the past two decades, only six schools have made it to the College Football Playoff championship game.

Financing other sports

There is more than hoisting football trophies at stake.

College football is a key driver of athletic department revenue as well, helping to pay for other sports programs. Athletic departments that field more than 30 varsity teams do so understanding that fewer than five varsity teams generate enough revenue to cover the entire athletics department’s expenses.

In fact, some critics argue that big-time college sports, which feature rosters made up primarily of black student-athletes, pay for the sports programs that include overwhelmingly white student-athletes, such as lacrosse and swimming, which receive far less media attention but are the bulk of athletes in major collegiate sports programs. Sixty-one percent of all student athletes are white.

Football revenue also helps finance athletic recruiting efforts and amenities, such as state-of-the-art facilities. All of that takes money, which takes recruits, which takes money. Every recruiting video, campus visit and hosted meal is a line item on an athletic department’s budget.

COVID-19 repercussions

The possibility of there being no college football season in the fall of 2020 is making athletics departments fear big budget cuts.

Already, some schools are dropping sports that were subsidized by college football revenues, like men’s soccer and wrestling. Smaller schools that depend on a few $1 million paydays in September from the major programs, may be left with gaping holes in their athletic budgets, threatening all sports.

There is little doubt that changes are coming to the current model of athletic department operations through a variety of converging forces. COVID-19 is unleashing widespread job losses, business closures and declining consumer spending that will limit what fans and advertisers can spend on football.

Another factor could be a change by the National Collegiate Athletic Association — which governs college athletics — that could allow student-athletes to get paid from their name, image and likeness.

While schools rich with talent may continue to get richer, those schools further down the recruiting pecking order will be left to wonder how they can survive at all.

Do they start allowing businesses like restaurants, theaters and hair salons to reopen, as Georgia did despite more than 20,000 cases there so far and opposition from several mayors? Is it OK to reopen beaches and stores, like South Carolina did? Or do they take a more cautious approach, as Massachusetts is doing by keeping schools closed through the end of the school year?

These decisions aren’t simple.

How and when states reopen their economies will look different from one state to the next state depending, in part, on where that state is in the trajectory of its coronavirus illnesses.

Can states start reopening without triggering a new surge?

We expect to see some rise in cases when economic and social activities restart. We don’t want to wait until there is no chance that would happen — people would literally go stir-crazy in their homes and it would decimate the economy.

What we want is to be confident that we have the capacity to identify coronavirus cases quickly and control the spread through contact tracing and isolation when we see them start to emerge again.

Can every state just follow the White House plan?

Under our country’s federalist system, protection of public health and safety is reserved to the state.

The White House’s plan provides a helpful starting point by offering a least restrictive path, but it suggests removing restrictions much more quickly than many public health people feel comfortable with.

For example, one trigger for the first phase of lifting restrictions is a downward trajectory, with 14 days of decreasing numbers of new COVID-19 cases. At that point, the White House plan says there can be large gatherings including at sports events and movie theaters, provided social distancing is followed.

Washington State has probably met that two-week threshold, but don’t expect Washington to allow large gatherings soon. Statistically, the chance of someone asymptomatic and infectious being at one of those gatherings and exposing a large number of people is pretty high. That’s a risk many states aren’t going to take.

Different models, including by researchers at Harvard Chan School of Public Health and Kathryn Peebles at the University of Washington, have suggested that you need to wait longer than 14 days to be confident you wouldn’t get a large resurgence. That could mean three or four weeks — I’m not saying months and months and months. But 14 days seems really short based on what I’ve seen of the coronavirus case curves and where most places are on that trajectory.

What do states gain by coordinating their plans?

Going into the first phase of lifting restrictions, states need to have enough testing and contact tracing capacity to be confident they can manage the cases that will still turn up. Even if a state isn’t seeing cases spreading within communities, travelers are still coming in from places where the pandemic is active.

Right now, we don’t have that capacity, even in Washington, and we have better capacity that most of the country.

That’s one reason partnering with other states makes sense.

When Washington partners with California and Oregon, we can pool our resources for developing testing capacity and contact tracing capacity. That bumps up the timeline for getting enough resources in place that we can be confident we can start lifting restrictions. It should take us much less time if we’re working together, and that’s huge.

Another big advantage is consistent messaging across a region where people cross state lines all the time.

Should all states be coordinating with others?

For states to coordinate, it’s helpful if they’re at similar stages in the epidemic. That’s part of why it makes sense for a few states to coordinate on the same plan rather than having one plan for the entire country.

New York is having such a different experience that it would be difficult for that state to coordinate reopening with Washington or California. In Washington, when the cases numbers plateaued, we were able to send extra ventilators to other regions. New York needs to be taking different steps at different times and has different resource challenges.

In Washington, Oregon and California, we also have similarities in how people and the governors weigh public health risk versus economic risk in a situation like this. Part of the reason Washington has done well after the early outbreak was that our local health departments were good about jumping on contact tracing and preparations, so by the time we did have community-level transmission, they had been preparing for weeks. We also have elected officials who have worked hand in hand with their public health officials.

Is a second surge of cases a foregone conclusion?

It is possible that we won’t see a second peak.

Having a vaccine widely available or a treatment people could take to prevent transmitting the disease could help the country avoid another surge. It’s also possible, as we saw with MERS and SARS, that once we are able to contain everything and get it to a low enough level, the coronavirus could die out on its own.

But we don’t want to count on that and not prepare for the possibility it comes back, particularly since so many people haven’t been infected. We still have a lot of people who are really vulnerable, so if we’re not careful enough about how we bring economic and social activities back online, we could have a resurgence.

Job loss is leading many of our friends and neighbors to miss rent, which in turn makes the buildings they call home vulnerable to foreclosure when landlords are unable to pay their own expenses.

The numbers are stark. Affordable housing providers in Chicago recently surveyed by the Department of Housing reported decreases in rent collection as high as 61 percent over the last few weeks. It is the same sad story across the country. The National Multifamily Housing Council, a multifamily apartment building industry group, polled its membership and found a 60% increase in nonpayment through April 12 compared to the same period a year ago.

Opinion

Even before the crisis, 63 percent of African American renters and 56 percent of Latino renters in Chicago were cost-burdened, as compared to 42 percent of white renters. Let’s face it: Long before the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed, Chicago was a city with profound racial and economic segregation and insufficient affordable housing.

COVID-19 is not creating inequities, it is simply reflecting those we already had.

The road to recovery has to involve us supporting each other as never before. If you are one of the fortunate who has not lost income during this time, one of the best ways to support those who have is to pay your rent.

Landlords have a better shot at being flexible with those who cannot pay if those who can, do. A wave of evictions or foreclosures is not in anyone’s interest.

The city is doing all that it can to address the crisis. Before March ended, the housing department made 2,000 grants for housing assistance available and received 83,000 applications in just five days. (Donate to the next round at https://givetogethernow.org/; under Location Preference, select Chicago.)

Last week, we introduced new grants to our affordable housing landlords to make up for rental shortfalls and remove red tape to refinance city loans in weeks instead of months. The grants should greatly help stabilize more than 3,400 units of affordable housing, keeping thousands of men, women and children safe and secure in their homes.

As the mayor says, we are all in this together. But the “all” must include the federal government, too.

The federal CARES Act provided a strong start for many issues, but only a sliver was dedicated to housing. To meet the scale of the crisis, we simply need more federal resources to keep low- and moderate-income Chicagoans housed. We’re talking $100 billion nationally for direct rental assistance alone, according to the National Low-Income Housing Coalition.

Here’s what else Chicago’s renters and owners need from Washington’s next COVID-19 relief package:

Emergency rental assistance and long-term sustained support for programs that produce and preserve affordable housing . Short-term direct rental assistance would meet the needs of tenants who don’t already have a subsidy like a Housing Choice Voucher and can help landlords to stay afloat.

. Short-term direct rental assistance would meet the needs of tenants who don’t already have a subsidy like a Housing Choice Voucher and can help landlords to stay afloat.

. This will allow us to better resource response efforts such as our Housing Assistance Fund and Emergency Relief for Affordable Multifamily Properties Program. Relief for city-supported affordable housing developments. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program is by far the largest program the city has to create and preserve new affordable rental homes. It is crucial during this unprecedented crisis that LIHTC buildings in the pipeline receive extensions on key deadlines to ensure this program continues serving Chicago’s low-income renters.

Those are some of the many things we need from the federal government. These precious resources, however, must be dispersed in a manner that accounts for COVID-19’s disproportionate impact on black and brown communities.

History tells us to expect an inequitable impact: During the housing crisis that began in 2008, black and Latino households were nearly 50 percent more likely to face foreclosure than white households, and the racial wealth gap widened. Just as we’ve seen with disproportionate levels of COVID-19 infection and death among black people, we are concerned about and working to solve for the housing impacts of the virus on communities of color.

Our housing solutions must and will address the needs of both tenants and landlords. We are committed to avoiding both widespread evictions and foreclosures. We know that by providing or maintaining stable, affordable housing, we are investing in the people who live there, who by having a quality, affordable place to call home, can be freed up to focus on the other parts of their lives that matter: Family, work, school and, of course, health.

But how is it impacting at-risk children who are in the custody of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services? How has DCFS been handing the crisis?

Opinion

First, the good news. Overall, DCFS has been doing a good job handling this unprecedented situation. These are some of the positive steps DCFS has taken:

DCFS has given guidance to its private agency partners, and has done so in a transparent manner. Every directive and protocol related to COVID-19 is collected in a prominent location on DCFS’s website.

About 85% of DCFS’s operations are being conducted remotely. This includes remote interviews of children, foster parents and other care providers. Even operators at DCFS’s child abuse hotline are handling calls remotely, from their homes.

DCFS is giving foster parents $100 supplemental payments for March and April, for a total of $200, due to the additional costs of caring for children who are at home instead of in school.

A coalition of advocates urged DCFS to provide services to assist youth and young adults who have recently “aged out” of DCFS or are about to age out. These youth, many of whom have special needs, are particularly vulnerable for loss of wages, mental health issues and homelessness. DCFS is extending services to these youth including assistance with housing, food, unemployment, mental health and medical care and casework support.

DCFS was scheduled to rollout a problematic managed care plan for all medical care for the 17,000 children in its care, many of whom have complex medical needs, on April 1. The rollout in February for 19,000 children who were formerly in DCFS care — children who have been adopted or are in subsidized guardianship — was a disaster, with some 2,500 children being dropped from their health coverage for up to a week and many other problems. DCFS agreed to delay the managed care rollout indefinitely due to COVID-19.

Although there is good news in DCFS’s handling of the pandemic, there’s a lot to be worried about:

Calls to DCFS’s child abuse hotline dropped by more than 50% since the shelter-in-place order went into effect. Yet there is every reason to believe that incidents of child abuse and domestic violence are up with families hunkered down and isolated at home under stressors that are associated with increased incidents of abuse such as worries about work, money, and health.

DCFS’s move to remote interviews of children was necessary to protect children, families, foster parents, DCFS personnel and the public. But remote interviews, especially of young children about sensitive topics such as abuse and neglect, are not as effective as live interactions. It’s just not possible to pick up on all of the child’s subtle body language and facial expressions. It’s also more difficult to monitor whether someone in the next room is coaching the child.

Most concerning, all of the systemic problems plaguing DCFS for years haven’t gone into abeyance because of the crisis. As just one example, DCFS is managing the coronavirus crisis with the sever shortage of placements for children that existed before. As a result, children continue to languish needlessly in out-of-state placements, in what are supposed to be emergency short-term shelters, and in locked psychiatric hospitals long after they are ready to be discharged, just like before the crisis. Only now it is far more difficult to monitor these children.

Regarding children who are in out-of-state placements, even before sheltering-in-place measures and remote interviews, it was difficult if not impossible to properly monitor these children and the quality of the faraway placements. In addition, even before sheltering in place, it was difficult to support visits with siblings, parents, and other family members in these faraway placements.

Regarding children languishing in locked psychiatric hospitals for weeks and months after they are ready for discharge, in addition to being antithetical to the children’s civil rights, these children are needlessly in congregate care settings with shift staff coming and going and new patients coming and going. These children are thus at needless increased risk of COVID-19 infection. This is a result of DCFS’s dangerous shortage of placements, a problem that DCFS has known about for years and which has gotten much worse over the past five years, during which DCFS lost hundreds of placements.

While DCFS has been doing an admirable job during the crisis, DCFS is operating under the many and severe systemic problems that existed before. Most all organizations, under these unprecedented circumstances, are understandably not running on all cylinders. But if they started with eight fully-charged cylinders, there are hopefully redundancies if a cylinder goes out. Unfortunately, before the pandemic started, DCFS was chocking along on only a few cylinders.

Children, like other vulnerable populations, will be disproportionally impacted by this crisis. When the crisis is behind us, Illinois must commit to meaningful reform of DCFS. Children are our most important asset, and they deserve better.

Why would they be destroying food at a time when grocery stores and food pantries struggle to keep pace with surging demand during the coronavirus pandemic?

Opinion

As sociologists with a specialty in agriculture and food, we study how the structure of the food system affects people’s lives and the environment. Seeing food destroyed at a time when people are going hungry highlights both short- and long-term problems with this system.

A tale of two supply chains

Surprisingly, the supply chain for food bears a striking similarity to that of another product that has experienced shortages: toilet paper.

Like the toilet paper market, the food industry has two separate supply chains for consumer and commercial use. On the consumer side are grocery and convenience stores that focus on small purchases. The commercial side represents restaurants and institutions such as schools, prisons, hospitals and corporate cafeterias that purchase large quantities of foods in bulk.

Ultimately, commercial institutions purchase in sizes that exceed the storage capacity of most households and food pantries.

While the commercial and the consumer supply chains are different, there are some commonalities: Both are complex, cover long distances and rely on just-in-time production. Both are also increasingly concentrated, meaning that there are only a few companies between farmers and consumers that process and distribute raw agricultural goods into edible food.

For example, on the commercial side, Sysco and U.S. Foods control an estimated 75% of the market for food distribution.

These characteristics make the supply chains more vulnerable to disruptions.

In 2018, over half of all U.S. spending on food was on the commercial side of the supply chain. The introduction of social distancing measures in March forced schools, corporate cafeterias and many restaurants to close. As a result, a lot of food intended for commercial use no longer had a buyer.

Where the supply chains diverge

To understand why this food can’t readily be diverted to consumers, let’s take a closer look at the supply chains for meat, vegetables and milk. With each category, there are different reasons.

Vegetable farmers, for example, have a lot of crops growing in their fields intended for commercial buyers like schools, restaurants and cruise lines, which are no longer purchasing these products.

But a worsening labor shortage makes it a lot harder to harvest or pick their crops and package them for consumers.

So a combination of plunging commercial demand, not enough low-wage yet skilled laborers, falling prices and a short window in which to pick vegetables means it has become cheaper to simply let them rot in the fields.

As for meat, restaurants typically order larger cuts and use more of the pricier parts like tenderloins. In contrast, much of the meat purchased on the consumer side is sold in “case-ready” packages, and ground beef is far more common.

So in general, commercial buyers tend to buy parts of the cow or pig that consumers simply don’t prepare at home. But what’s more, meat plant closures due to COVID-19 outbreaks are creating a bottleneck for slaughtering and processing animals, which also have a short window before they’re past their prime.

As a result, producers, particularly pork farmers, are debating whether to feed and care for their animals past their prime or simply euthanize them.

Milk is even more complicated when it comes to how it flows along the food chain.

First, there’s no stopping cows giving milk; udders that are full must be emptied daily. The only question is where that milk will go.

Restaurants and organizations like schools purchase nearly half of all milk, butter and other dairy products processed in the U.S. Pizzerias alone take nearly a quarter of all U.S. cheese production.

With many of these customers closed or cutting their purchases, there’s lots of excess milk. Unfortunately, processors do not have the equipment to package that milk into smaller containers for grocery stories and retail use.

As for converting more milk into dairy products with longer shelf lives like cheese, there was already a glut of mozzarella and other cheese plugging up cold storage space. And despite a rise in takeout pizza, overall demand for cheese has “dropped like a rock,” according to trade industry sources.

That has left dairy farmers with little choice but to dump excess milk into manure ponds and ditches.

A longer-term problem

Many states are working on short-term solutions to bridge the gap between the two supply chains.

Nebraska is temporarily allowing restaurants to sell unlabeled packaged foods to customers, Texas is pushing restaurants to prepare food care packages for at-risk families, and many other states have changed their health regulations to allow restaurants to repackage products into smaller quantities to sell to the public.

In addition, the U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to begin purchasing $3 billion in fresh produce, dairy and meat to support farmers and eventually distribute it to food pantries and other organizations feeding Americans in need.

Although helpful in the short term, we believe a longer-term problem that needs to be addressed is how concentrated food supply chains have become, which has made them less nimble in adapting to disruptions like a health pandemic.

After that experiment to boost passenger capacity failed to sit well with commuters, the CTA introduced new rail cars outfitted mostly with center-facing seats to accommodate the crush-loading of cars to as many as 120 people. Such close contact was well above the goal of a later “de-crowding’’ initiative aimed at reducing human freight to 70 to 75 people per car on average.

Opinion

It’s unclear whether anything resembling the tin-of-sardines transit experience will ever return in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing. But I don’t know how you take the mass out of mass transit.

Amidst staggering losses currently at the farebox that may take years to recover from, it now appears that the pre-pandemic challenges to accommodate the ridership gains of years’ past were a good problem for the CTA, and Metra, to have.

Until now, transportation, and particularly mass transit, were considered part of the go-to solution to deal with just about any catastrophe. Downtown Chicago was evacuated in short order after the terrorist attacks on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001.

Yet when the reality finally set in late this winter about the lethal threat posed by the novel coronavirus, health officials across the country issued a proclamation that previously seemed unimaginable: The public, except for essential workers including medical and safety personnel commuting to their jobs, should stay off trains and buses until further notice.

Transit ridership has plunged since Illinois’ stay-at-home order took effect on March 21. The few people still riding have posted photos on social media showing them having entire train coaches and buses almost all to themselves. Transit officials have tried, meanwhile, to reassure these diehard customers that seats, grab poles and hanging straps are being wiped down daily to minimize the spread of disease.

CTA ridership has plunged about 80 percent since Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order. Metra ridership is in an even bigger free-fall, projected to be down 97 percent in April compared with the same month a year ago, officials said.

“Commuter rail will not be the same after COVID-19,” Tom Farmer, Metra’s chief financial officer, told the Metra board during an online meeting on April 15. “We have just been crushed.’’

It’s a transit doomsday warning that far exceeds Chicago-area transit agencies’ cries for financial help in the early 2000s. A CTA budget shortfall in 2009 led the transit agency to impose service cuts in 2010 on more than 100 bus routes and seven rail lines. The drastic schedule changes prompted commuters to make new travel choices. But they eventually circled back to their preferred method of getting around this congested region. By 2012, CTA ridership reached its highest level in 22 years, adding some 13 million rides compared to 2011.

Before the ongoing public health emergency, the Chicago region’s transit agencies were already weighed down by a backlog of infrastructure improvement needs totaling billions of dollars. The formidable burdens, new and old, will not fade without concerted action at the local, state and federal levels and an openness to trying new ideas.

But instead of joining Metra’s gloomy long-term outlook for public transit, I’m reminded about a cable that Mark Twain sent from London to the press in the United States after the mistaken publication of his obituary: “Reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.’’

He was the third person to die of COVID-19 while jailed, and 353 incarcerated people and 261 staff have since then tested positive.

“I feel like I lost the battle for my husband,” Lee’s widow told the Chicago Sun-Times.

Most people in Cook County Jail have not been convicted of any crime, and are being held because they don’t have the money to post bail. But even as the number of people in the jail who are sick with COVID-19 increases, another week has passed without significant action by county officials to reduce the jail population.

Opinion

Social distancing is impossible in the crowded and unsanitary confines of the jail, which is now one of the foremost sites of the pandemic in the nation. Close quarters create a kind of Russian roulette death penalty for people awaiting trial. COVID-19 cases soon could overwhelm the jail’s health systems, creating chaos and making the facility difficult to secure. County leaders must rapidly find ways to responsibly release people and provide housing and safe quarantine outside of the jail.

As researchers, we have been tracking the ways that jails and prisons increase the spread of COVID-19. There are still more than 4,300 people being held in Cook County Jail, and the rate of spread of the virus is about 33 times higher inside the jail than it is in the city of Chicago.

African Americans are jailed disproportionately in Cook County, and this crisis is further heightening racial inequality. While the courts have slowed the number of people entering the jail, releases have not risen to the level required to prevent mass deaths. Each day that passes without a significant reduction in the jail population imperils the health of incarcerated people, jail employees and their families, as well as the health of all those who live in the surrounding communities.

The pandemic is revealing the ways in which Cook County has used the jail to address a myriad of social problems; many people are held in jail because they have an addiction, are homeless, or struggle with mental illness. According to the Chicago Community Bond Fund, at least 260 people languish in jail simply because they are poor and cannot afford to post a low cash bond. Those who pose no threat to public safety should not be held in jail, but Cook County’s social safety net is thin, so jail is often used in place of a homeless shelter or psychiatric hospital.

In mid-March, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx and Public Defender Amy Campanelli worked together to identify a list of hundreds of people who could be released from jail without posing a threat to public safety. While an important first step, this process was not exhaustive, and many more cases should be considered for release.

It is time for Cook County officials, Chief Judge Tim Evans and Criminal Division Chief Judge LeRoy Martin Jr. to get back to the table, identify all people who can be safely released and create a process for expedited hearings and releases. If they don’t, it could soon become impossible to provide medical care for the number of cases in the Cook County Jail, and these cases threaten to overwhelm the county’s medical systems.

Sheriff Tom Dart has taken steps to improve sanitation and distancing practices in the jail, including the moving of people to single cells, but no one can meaningfully control the spread of COVID-19 or prevent mass deaths in a crowded jail. Hand soap and sanitizer are rationed, hundreds of people share bathrooms, and health care is in short supply. Even when assigned to single cells, people sleep within a few feet of one another.

It is not too late to responsibly release people from Cook County Jail, strengthening the county’s efforts to flatten the curve of the spread of the coronavirus. A coalition of civil rights groups has sued Dart in federal court to secure the immediate release of many of those being held in the jail. On April 9, a federal court sent the suit back to a state court, creating further delays.

Cook County leaders should look to San Francisco, where efforts to control COVID-19 in the local jail have been swift and effective. The San Francisco district attorney and public defender worked together to quickly reduce the jail population by 40%. They assessed who was safe for release, including the elderly, some veterans, those being held for misdemeanors, those awaiting placement in a mental health facility, those being detained simply because of an inability to pay bail, and those already scheduled for release.

San Francisco has proved that mass release can be done safely.

Just as Mayor Lori Lightfoot acted quickly to repurpose McCormick Place to treat COVID-19 cases, fast action must be taken to depopulate the jail now, so that detainees and community members alike can effectively practice social distancing.

Lightfoot has led efforts to turn empty downtown hotels into housing for people who have tested positive for COVID-19 but have mild symptoms. Why can’t empty hotel rooms across the city be used to house those who need a safe place to quarantine after release from jail?

Creative housing solutions that offer people a safe two-week quarantine upon release, along with greatly expanded access to testing for COVID-19 for everyone in contact with the jail, could save the lives not only of incarcerated people, but also jail workers and others.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote, “justice too long delayed is justice denied.”

In this case, justice delayed is spiking the curve and putting everyone’s lives in danger.

We had been under Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order for nearly a week.

Other than to buy groceries, I had left my apartment only for short walks, eager for warm weather as Chicago’s winter finally began to fade. That day, Mayor Lori Lightfoot shut down Chicago’s lakefront because folks couldn’t seem to follow the rules. It felt like the teacher cancelling recess because of those two kids who just won’t listen.

Opinion

My days during the first week of stay-at-home had all been much of the same — work from home, exercise when I remembered, take in too much news (and wine) and slowly get through the unread books on my bookshelf. I had started writing “read during the COVID-19 pandemic” in the back of the books that I finished, thinking about the conversations I might have one day with my future children and grandchildren.

Video conversations with my family and friends were bright spots during a gloomy time.

But that Thursday was different. I woke up to a text from my sister saying there was a COVID-19 case at our grandma’s long-term care facility in Flossmoor. My siblings and I, spread across the country from Denver to New York, video-chatted, and then we talked with our mom. We were worried, unsure of what to do or how to react.

I thought about going up to Evanston to see my mother, but my fear of possibly exposing her to COVID-19, though I exhibited no symptoms, overwhelmed me. After all, I had been on airplanes less than two weeks before. The world had changed so dramatically.

My 90-year-old grandmother, who was immunocompromised, was experiencing shortness of breath that day. My mom drove down to Flossmoor and stood outside my grandmother’s window. She held up a sign that read “Love you.” Like me, my mother couldn’t physically be with her mother that day.

As my siblings and I talked with our mom over the phone, we heard the siren of an ambulance growing closer and louder. The louder it got, the more I knew the ambulance was coming for my grandma.

My grandma was admitted to the hospital with atrial fibrillation and low potassium, and she was tested for COVID-19. Not allowed inside the hospital, my mom sat in the parking lot as rain poured down, staring at a single-wide trailer being used to process emergency room admissions as she texted updates to my siblings and me.

The next day, I learned that my grandma had tested positive for COVID-19. I talked to her over the phone while she laid in bed without family by her side. She told me how proud she was of me and to keep doing good in the world. I told her how much I loved her and that I would continue to do my best to make the world a better place. A feeling that this would be our last conversation hung over me as tears filled my eyes.

On April 2, I learned that feeling was right. My mom called to tell me that my grandma had passed away. I am so thankful that my mom was able, eventually, to physically be with grandma before she passed, and that members of the family near and far were able to speak with her over the phone.

I know my story is like so many others. Loved ones suffering, families unable to physically be with one another. We can’t hug the people we love, can’t hold their hand in silence, can’t kiss them on the cheek.

The lucky among us get to say “I love you” over the phone; others will never have that opportunity, never get to say goodbye.

While I hope the federal government does all it can to combat this crisis, there is no doubt in my mind that President Trump’s lack of preparedness, competency, urgency and empathy has caused pain and suffering for my family and for families across the country. The tears that filled my eyes after talking to my grandma for the last time reflected that pain and suffering.

I am rooting for our country, but the president’s poor response to the coronavirus has motivated me to double my efforts to see that he and all those who enable him are voted out of office come November.

On March 27, less than one week before she died from COVID19, my grandma — Ruth G. Johnston — told me to keep doing good in the world. Well, that’s exactly what I plan to do.

See you in November, Mr. President.

The most obvious explanation for this is that people who suffer from underlying health issues such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity and lung diseases are at the highest risk of dying from COVID-19 — and the black community disproportionately suffers from these conditions.

The question for the future, then, is what’s to be done about this? How do we improve overall health for black Chicago?

Opinion

A 1986 World Health Organization agreement, the Ottawa Charter, provides a blueprint for promoting community health that could be helpful here. It enumerates nine areas that need to be addressed to develop healthy communities — peace, shelter, education, food, income, a stable eco-system, sustainable resources, social justice and equity.

What might be some concrete steps, guided by this document, that we can take as a city to improve health outcomes in Chicago’s black community?

Peace: Reduce mass incarceration through bail reform and decriminalize drugs. Strengthen efforts to reduce gang violence through existing community-based programs. Expand mental health outreach. Promote ongoing police and community dialogue and engagement.

Shelter: Increase the amount of affordable housing in Chicago. Invest in infrastructure and make sure that all parts of the city have access to safe public transportation, bridges, overpasses and roads.

Education: Continue efforts to support public education and improve graduation rates.

Food: Encourage a more vegetarian or vegan diet — “What would Jesus eat?” Encourage every church to plant an “edible” garden.

Income: Continue to support and advocate for a livable wage, as well as for minority participation in infrastructure and building projects. Impose a Tobin tax — a small tax on short-term currency transactions — on the trading of stock, bonds and futures contracts.

Stable eco-system: Reduce levels of air pollution in Chicago through improved mass transit and the planting of trees. Do a better job of municipal recycling.

Sustainable resources: Encourage solar and wind power efforts, such as solar roofs. Ensure minority participation in the installation of green technology.

Social Justice: Lower the eligibility requirements for Medicaid in Illinois. Improving access to health care is a matter of social justice.

Equity: Continue efforts at affirmative action. Enforce existing laws on minority hiring and access to quality city services.

To be sure, many of these advancements will be a challenge to carry out. Without this kind of systematic reform, however, the health disparities in our city that have become glaringly obvious during this pandemic will continue, always with the same dire consequences.

Opinion

Normal is millions of low-income students leaving school without the skills to get a job and millions of college graduates drowning in debt. Normal is a digital divide that denies millions of students and families the same access to technology most of us take for granted. Normal is 100,000 Americans injured or killed with guns each year and school children doing live shooter drills.

Normal is most working people living paycheck to paycheck and unable to cope with a $400 emergency. Normal is limited family leave and no support for child or elder care. Normal is rising substance abuse and declining life expectancy in communities from urban to rural.

Normal is 38 million American households paying too much for a roof overhead and half a million people sleeping on the streets every night. Normal is the top one percent of America having more wealth than the bottom 90 percent and CEO’s earning nearly 300 times more than their employees. Normal is billionaires paying a lower percentage of their income in taxes than their secretaries.

Lawmakers in Washington just passed a $2.2 trillion stimulus that bails out existing companies and small businesses, helps the newly unemployed, and provides some support to state and local governments. There’s also money for the health care industry, checks for working families and the poor, and some relief from student loans.

While these needs are all real in this crisis, that $2.2 trillion of our money will do nothing to change the structural inequities in our society. As an African-American emergency room doctor in Chicago wrote, “To really address the issue of African American health risks in the age of corona virus, we need to acknowledge the root causes.”

Those root causes include racism and discrimination. They include disinvestment in inner-city communities. They include our broken politics that have paralyzed governments and our misguided tax and labor policies that have consolidated wealth and hollowed out the middle class.

As Congress considers additional measures needed to recover from the COVID crisis, let’s think a little harder about the world we want and need rather than the world we have. Let’s imagine a world where incarceration is a last resort rather than the default solution to crime. Let’s imagine a world where guns are kept from people who shouldn’t have them.

Let’s imagine a world where health care and housing are affordable and available to everyone, along with paid family leave, child care and elder care. Let’s imagine a world where on-line learning is accessible to every student who needs it.

Let’s imagine a world where science rather than politics drives our response to climate change. Let’s imagine a world where elected officials are held accountable for misleading us and where they are unable to rig elections with gerrymandering and voter suppression.

Finally, let’s imagine a world where there’s plenty of incentive to work hard and even get rich but there are some common-sense measures in place to ensure that a tiny few can’t capture an obscene amount of the nation’s wealth while the majority of Americans struggle.

In the world we can imagine, shared prosperity is possible by recommitting to the basic middle-class promise: a good job that can support a family, affordable housing, health care and education, and a dignified and secure retirement.

The COVID crisis will be with us for several more months, but the economic fallout will be with us for years, and the underlying inequities will be with us forever if we don’t do something about them. It’s time to seize the moment and create a new normal.

These measures include closing “non-essential” businesses, schools, universities and public services for a specified time period. Other measures focus on “social distancing” and prohibiting meetings, sports events and other public gatherings.

Opinion

Despite our best preventive health measures, thousands of people are expected to be hospitalized. This will be expensive.

ProPublica and the Harvard Global Health Institute have recently released a fascinating analysis of U.S. national, regional and municipal hospital capacity and how it relates to COVID-19.

The report looks at U.S. hospital capacity under various scenarios. The report asks what would happen to an area’s hospital capacity if 20%, 40% or 60% of an area’s population were infected with COVID-19 over a six-month, 12-month or 18-month interval.

For example, Chicago would reach approximately 120% of total hospital capacity if 20% of the population were infected in six months, according to this model. However, if 20% of Chicago’s population were infected over 18 months, hospital capacity would not be reached.

Many of those who have been infected with COVID-19 will be admitted to intensive care units with respiratory failure and will require support with mechanical ventilators.

The health insurance dilemma caused by unemployment

A majority of Americans receive their health insurance through their jobs. But on April 2, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that over 6 million people filed for unemployment benefits.

Many of these people have lost their health insurance and have joined the ranks of the approximately 28 million Americans who had no health insurance prior to the COVID-19 crisis.

It has been estimated that just one hospitalization for COVID-19 may range from $38,000 to $74,000. So not only must families worry about contracting COVID-19, they may also have to worry about being uninsured and, if someone becomes ill, potentially having to take dire financial steps, including filing for bankruptcy.

A potential solution

The Trump administration has recently stated that it would help hospitals by providing coverage for uninsured COVID-19 patients. But a better way to solve this problem might be to look at two very successful health programs — Medicare and Medicaid. These two programs could be expanded. The expansion would cover many of those uninsured Americans.

While the Trump administration’s plan to help uninsured COVID-19 patients is laudable, the plan does little to help uninsured patients who have other health issues requiring hospitalization. Here are a couple of suggestions to fix things:

• Consider lowering the age of Medicare eligibility to 60 years. This would help those working people who are not old enough to have Medicare eligibility, which begins at age 65.

• Relax the criteria for Medicaid eligibility. This can be done through an 1115 waiver. This provision allows a state to request additional funding and flexibility in determining eligibility in providing care to those who qualify for Medicaid. Gov. J.B. Pritzker has applied for a such a waiver for Illinois.

Both these steps will help us be better prepared for health care in the COVID-19 era . . . and the post-COVID-19 era.

We need to pressure the Congress and the Trump administration to address the long-term issue of health care and the uninsured by expanding eligibility for Medicare and Medicaid.

Surviving a life-threatening accident at a young age transformed me. Afterwards, I had no more illusions about my mortality or the sacredness of time. I discovered a new urgency to live well. My long-term goals came front and center.

From my accident I learned that the smallest choices made while in crisis significantly influence our futures — even more so than during the ordinary times of life. Each moment matters. The potential of time is magnified. How we handle tough times really does define us.

Opinion

Now, our entire society is in crisis as we scramble to survive the coronavirus pandemic. None of us have clarity about when this will end. What we do during these days is crucial to our futures.

As I write this, I am in day 36 of “sheltering in place.” As I adjust to this reality, I notice that the little choices I make are transforming me. I tidy my bedroom more. I finally bought a watch, hoping to look at my phone less. Although this may be mundane, I wonder how these new habits will change me.

I was curious whether others were forming new habits too; if anyone else was finding themselves using time differently. So I asked my Twitter followers, “What new thing are you doing now in quarantine that you hope to keep doing after this madness ends?”

I found that some people are using this time to nurture their creative sides. One friend is learning new folk songs with her partner. Others are learning to play classical masterpieces. One woman told me she is writing her memoirs for her grandchildren.

I noticed that others “sheltering in place” are developing their domestic sides. Some are cleaning more. Many people are organizing their pantries and baking so much bread the stores are on short on yeast.

With death counts in the daily headlines, we are more aware of the sacredness of our relationships. Parents are, by necessity, becoming more involved with the education of their kids, sometimes learning alongside them. We’re talking on the phone more. We are even writing letters again.

Amid the anxiety and fear, we recognize this time as an opportunity to redefine who we are. We can restructure how we live our lives —and this can be both a challenge and a gift.

The writer Jessica Mesman tweeted that this crisis has graced her with is a different understanding of time: “I no longer feel rushed. Time has elongated. There seems like there will be time for everything. That’s unnerving but it’s also showing me how much of my busy-ness was self-imposed.”

Now that time has been rearranged we have choices to make. We each have a chance to decide: who do I want to be during and after this crisis and how can I use time differently in order to become that person?

While life is taking on a new structure, new habits are being established and priorities being revealed — along the way we are becoming new people. Many of us are living through profound trauma and grief. But we might also become more grounded and connected; more intentional, authentic and emotionally healthy. During this crisis, we can all change for the better.

To defeat a lethal enemy, we sacrifice freedoms, limit contact with others, surrender financial security, and restrict ourselves from things we would like to be doing, in service of the greater good of saving lives.

It strikes me that the same thing was happening around this time 57 years ago.

Opinion

On April 16, 1963 (Good Friday that year), 50 courageous individuals chose to be commanded by the government to remain in place; they did so to combat a pernicious, nation-ravaging evil that had taken countless lives and seemingly knew no borders. Led by Martin Luther King, Fred Shuttlesworth and Ralph Albernathy, these peaceful protest marchers were incarcerated by Bull Connor. They intentionally remained in jail, eschewing bond, to combat the deathly evil of racism.

From that very Birmingham Jail, Dr. King would pen his rightly famous letter. He challenged us to pay attention to what his moment made clear, bringing to the surface the problems already present.

“We bring [racism] out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. … Injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured.”

Dr. King taught us that racism must be exposed. In the age of COVID-19, racism certainly has been exposed as a stubbornly infectious and lethal American virus. Racism is combining with the coronavirus to double the damage inflicted upon African Americans.

We learned last week that people of color are dying disproportionately of the novel coronavirus. While some sing the chorus “the virus knows no color”, African Americans are dying of the disease at alarming rates: people of color constitute 42% of COVID fatalities, but only 21% of the national population. Here in Chicago, the statistics are more stark: 70% of coronavirus deaths have found victims in our African American community.

The injustice has been exposed is that both COVID-19 and racism are killing the black community in Chicago and throughout America. This is not the bias of petty personal prejudice, but racism entrenched in American institutions: the legacy of intentional racist policies that led to tragic disproportions in housing, educational opportunities, food availability, employment prospects, and wealth generation.

Racism kills. It killed through the master’s whip. It killed through lynchings. It killed through the KKK. It kills through mass incarceration, with Cook County Jail serving as the worst current example. But racism also kills through the continuing effects of centuries of American policy that are every bit as lethal.

Yes, we are seeing death by COVID-19. But we are also witnessing death by racism. And through our history, racism has a much higher and even more tragic body count.

Fifthy-seven years ago, Dr. King did more than shelter-in-place to combat racism; he went to jail.

I imagine Dr. King might be encouraged to see all we are sacrificing to counter COVID-19. But I know he would also challenge us with this question: if we are willing to sacrifice to fight one deadly disease, what will America muster finally to combat the lethal virus of racism?

Americans have proven this month that, even without strong centralized leadership, we can unite to combat a pernicious killer. We can combine individual effort with state leadership and unprecedented federal investment to overcome a menacing threat.

Once we defeat the coronavirus, the time has come — and the road map has been drawn — for us as a nation finally to defeat the plague of racism.

Workers are being furloughed or losing their jobs altogether. Families are worried about making rent and feeding their kids.

As we work together to contain the spread of COVID-19, we must also have an open and active conversation about ensuring Illinois’ economic recovery is as strong as possible. That means establishing a process and timeline to safely and effectively open the economy, so we are not only protecting lives but also safeguarding livelihoods.

Opinion

Gov. J.B. Pritzker has failed to address Illinois’ broken unemployment system, which has been unable to deliver benefits to people desperate for a lifeline. He has been incapable of cutting through the confusion facing small business owners, gig workers, independent contractors and sole proprietors about the status of their benefits. And on Sunday, after the nation’s top infectious disease expert said some sectors of the economy might be able to start reopening in May, Pritzker finally hinted that the state is thinking about — just thinking about — how to safely get key sectors back online, but that remains a closed conversation.

The uncertainty created by Pritzker’s lack of leadership on these issues is making residents panic. We are hearing from them daily.

We heard from a Morton husband and wife team staring down $46,000 in property tax payments as their tenants can’t make rent.

We heard from an Eldorado trucker who saw his paycheck cut in half, and who wants the progressive income tax hike removed from the ballot for fear it will drive his customers out of state.

We heard from a new Chicago restaurant owner in the South Loop, who started a change.org petition that calls on the governor to fix a loophole in the small business loan program.

Pritzker has said repeatedly that he cannot count on the White House, but he isn’t offering details on recovery solutions of his own. He should follow the example of other states, such as Utah, where state and local governments are putting together their own plans to navigate reopening the economy without prompting a second-wave outbreak. Or the example of New York, which reached out to Google to fix their unemployment system so new federal benefits could reach self-employed workers.

My organization, the Illinois Policy Institute, is the strongest taxpayer advocate network in Illinois. I am proud that we have been able to use our megaphone to make sure the people of Illinois are seen and heard by state and local lawmakers, and we’ve fostered conversations within our community as to what should happen next.

Those conversations are open-minded and productive. The same is not true in Springfield, where so far the only specifics residents have heard in the way of economic problem-solving is pointing the finger at the federal government. In a crisis, strong leaders prove themselves by stepping up and taking action. My organization has commended Pritzker on his efforts to contain the spread of the virus when it was warranted — we understand that public health and people’s lives must always come first.

But we hear almost every day from people struggling to make ends meet, with no money coming in this month or last, and no idea when they’ll be able to work again. So we decided to open up a conversation, asking people what they think and what they’d like their leaders to do.

Instead of offering help to the Illinoisans we highlighted, a spokesperson for the governor proceeded to attack us for providing them a forum.

That is not leadership.

Gov. Pritzker: Uncertainty is the enemy.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been a trying and unprecedented time, but that does not excuse defensive leadership that shifts blame. Accountability and openness are needed from those in whom the people have placed their trust — and to be specific, that means public confidence rises when Illinoisans see you and your team are open to ideas and working on a plan and a timeline to get the state back to work.

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced teachers, students and families to make quick adjustments into new daily roles and routines.

Some families may be undergoing such profound stress that students cannot do any schoolwork at all. For other students, schoolwork may provide some stability and a sense of purpose for their future.

The good news is that even when faced with major disruptions in learning, children are resilient and tend to catch up in skill development to where they would have been, as long as they enter a supportive environment after the disruption. Students who have a smaller gain in learning in one year tend to have a larger gain in the following year.

Opinion

As the district, teachers, and families figure out the strategies that work best for them, there are lessons from research conducted under normal conditions that may be helpful in this unique situation.

Countering the limitations of online Instruction

Research indicates that most students learn better when instruction is in person, rather than online, and students with the lowest achievement seem to benefit least from online classes. Even if online instruction isn’t as effective as face-to-face instruction, it is still effective for most students, and better than no instruction.

One reason students sometimes struggle with online learning is because of a lack of flexibility in what is taught. While online classes are usually self-paced, course content can feel rigid. In a study comparing online to face-to-face algebra credit recovery classes, researchers found that face-to-face teachers adjusted the content of their instruction considerably more than online teachers, even though the online teachers had the technology to be able to offer mini-tutorials and respond directly to students’ questions.

It was easier for the in-person teachers to recognize when students needed help and adapt their instruction accordingly. In fact, when students taking the algebra course online had access to a supportive math teacher in their computer lab, they ended up with similar pass rates as students enrolled in face-to-face versions of the same class.

All of this suggests that online learning places more demands on teachers around intentional communication with students and their caregivers.

Communication among teachers, students, and families is even more critical now

Another downside of online instruction is that it makes two-way communication more cumbersome. Teachers can’t anticipate how all their individual students will respond to instructional tasks, and the feedback they ordinarily get in the classroom as they watch and listen to students engage with the material is vital information for doing their jobs well.

Students feel supported when they believe their teacher knows how they are doing in the class and gives them the support they need to succeed. Without having students in front of them, teachers may not know when they are assigning work that is taking longer than it should to complete and when students feel stuck or overwhelmed. They also will have difficulty recognizing when students are under-challenged or disinterested.

It can be easier for people at home to see whether students need more support, whether work is taking too long, or if students feel under-challenged. To support learning at home, teachers and families need to be in regular communication, whether they have the technology for face-to-face online chats, or are reaching out by phone, group chats, texting, etc.

Even when assignments are not being used for grades, teachers can monitor assignment completion as a signal for who might need help, modifications, resources, or a more personal connection.

Learning is more than test scores — it’s also social and emotional

Brain science has shown that learning has both social and emotional components—people are not computers who can input information and retain it without making an emotional connection and seeing how it fits with their other experiences.

Teachers and caregivers who are supporting learning at home need to talk to students about how they are experiencing the work. Do students believe they can succeed at the task? Do they feel the work is relevant? Do they feel they will learn and grow from the experience?

Students’ confidence that they can succeed at their school assignments, and that the work has value, provides a sense of security and motivation.

What happens in the long-term will matter most

There is no clear roadmap for teachers, parents, and guardians right now. Nobody is going to be perfect in how they are able to support students, even as they all work very hard to do so. The crisis is causing acute immediate stress — from sharing confined space and home technology, to worry about severe financial and health effects on ourselves and others.

There will also be long-term stress from the financial fallout of the crisis and the loss of loved ones. Families will not have all the financial and emotional supports that they did previously, and inequities in education will become more extreme.

Supporting all students ultimately means making preparation so that students have a safe, stable school environment that is responsive to the social-emotional needs of every child when they go back to the classroom.

With the latest 130 deaths, the state’s toll so far in May alone is 1,727 people, and 4,058 overall.

There were also 2,432 more people who tested positive among the latest batch of 26,565 test results, officials said. And Edgar County became the 100th county to record positive cases in the state.

There have been 90,369 confirmed coronavirus cases since the pandemic began.

The state’s overall positivity rate — the number of positive cases compared to total tests received within the last 24 hours — was 9.1%. And the Northeast region, home to Chicago, Cook and the collar counties, remained under 20%, a required benchmark to enter the next phase of Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s regional reopening plan.

But the positivity rate is a seven-day rolling average and the data lags, Pritzker’s office has said. Each of the state’s four regions must be under that rate for 14 days to advance to the third reopening phase, which allows some “non-essential” businesses to resume limited operations.

The current seven day average of the positivity rate is 12%, Pritzker said, down from an April peak of 23.6%. But the governor warned that part of the reason the positivity rate is lower is because of increased testing.

“Remember, we surpassed 10,000 tests per day for the first time on April 24, and we’ve stayed above 11,000 every day since then. Over the last seven days, we’ve nearly doubled that, with an average of 20,000 tests per day,” Pritzker said. “The good news is that our current statewide positivity rate is under 14% on average for the last 14 days. And that’s likely becoming a better indicator of the true infection rate among the general public than it was when testing was far more limited.”

Pritzker also announced six new testing sites in Chicago, in Little Village, Pullman, Hanson Park, Englewood, Gage Park and Bridgeport.

The state is also launching four new drive-thru sites. Starting Saturday, a drive-thru site in Chatham will begin testing, as well as sites in Champaign, Peoria and Rolling Meadows.

All testing is free, and the sites will be open seven days a week.

Dr. Ngozi Ezike, the head of the Illinois Dept. of Public Health, said as of Thursday night, there were 4,367 people in the state’s hospitals with COVID-19. Of those, about a quarter of them — 1,129 — were in intensive care units, and 675 were on ventilators.

Hospital metrics are also key to Pritzker’s reopening plan. To get to Phase 3, regions must show no overall increase in hospital admissions for COVID-19 symptoms for 28 days, and have at least 14% of ICU beds, medical and surgery beds and ventilators available.

Ezike also issued recommendations for expectant mothers, warning they must be tested for the coronavirus before they’re admitted for delivery.

“First of all, many of the symptoms associated with labor can mimic or cover up symptoms of COVID-19, so we could easily escape detection with just symptom screening,” Ezike said. “But we also know that many people with COVID-19 are completely asymptomatic.

Ezike said early data from hospitals show a positivity rate of between 3% and 12% fo expectant mothers admitted for labor. She said women may be at further risk of additional complications if they have COVID-19.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

And as they prepare for the Legislature’s long-sought session next week, Republicans said Thursday they are willing to comply with safety guidelines issued by the Democrats – but they want an examination of their own.

GOP lawmakers said they will wear face coverings, submit to COVID-19 tests and temperature checks and follow other safety measures when they return to Springfield, but they balked at signing a pledge to follow those recommendations as requested by House Speaker Mike Madigan.

And Republicans want to put Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s “Restore Illinois” plan under the microscope with a public hearing.

GOP lawmakers have criticized Pritzker’s “Restore Illinois” plan as “arbitrary,” saying the dates in which parts of the states can begin to reopen don’t make sense, and its metrics ignore geographical differences in COVID-19’s impact.

Hoping to modify Pritzker’s plan, Republican Leader Bill Brady requested a hearing with Pritzker and Democratic lawmakers to “inquire about how they came to the conclusions in their plan.”

“I have heard members from both caucuses suggest this plan should be vetted and revised,” the Bloomington Republican wrote in a letter to Democratic Senate President Don Harmon. “I also believe this should be done in a public setting, which can be undertaken using available technology and social distancing protocols when we convene in Springfield.”

But when asked about the idea of a public hearing to hash out the Restore Illinois plan, Pritzker told reporters “it sounds like grandstanding to me.”

The Chicago Democrat said Brady should just give him a call.

“Leader Brady has my number,” Pritzker said at his daily briefing. “I’m not sure what he’s missing out on.”

“I’m very happy to have conversations with members of the opposite party and with members of the General Assembly, and I have been doing so every single day,” Pritzker said, urging Brady to call him. “I speak with him quite frequently, so there’s no lack of communication.”

Brady quickly responded to Pritzker’s dismissal of his proposed hearing as “grandstanding.”

“My caucus and I take the lives of our residents, and their livelihood, seriously,” Brady tweeted. “The public has a right to know how the decisions impacting their lives are being made. This is not about grandstanding; this is about transparency.”

It’s a recurring Republican complaint, that the Democrats are keeping them in the dark.

When the General Assembly meets next week, it will be the first time since early March. And in that time, more than one million Illinoisans have filed for unemployment benefits, and Democrats have projected the state’s budget shortfall at $6.2 billion.

But even with a return to Springfield, Republicans said they remain concerned that Democrats, who have super-majorities in both the House and Senate and control all statewide elected offices, will still leave the GOP out.

“There’s no reason why this should have taken so long,” said state Rep. Tim Butler, R-Springfield. “We’re a co-equal branch of government, we can convene in a safe manner.”

The Illinois House is planning to meet at the Bank of Springfield Center, while the Senate is scheduled to convene in the State Capitol. In a letter to House Republican Leader Jim Durkin, Madigan asked members of the Republican caucus to follow “precautions that we will take upon a return,” such as submitting to COVID-19 tests and temperature checks, wearing face coverings, observing social distancing and traveling and lodging in Springfield alone.

During a Zoom news conferences Thursday, Republican lawmakers said they had no problems following the health and safety guidelines, “if that’s what it takes to get us back to Springfield,” but when it came to signing a pledge they refused.

“Will I sign a pledge? There’s no need for that,” said state Rep. C.D. Davidsmeyer, R-Jacksonville. “I’m a responsible adult, I don’t need to sign a pledge to Speaker Madigan so he knows what I’m going to do.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

By Thursday, the county assumed the ominous moniker of having the most COVID-19 cases of any county in the United States with 58,457.

But Gov. J.B. Pritzker, facing daily criticisms from Republican legislators and the more than a million Illinoisans who are unemployed during the pandemic, signaled some hope for the Northeast region of his reopening plan, which includes Cook, the collar counties — and counties that aren’t too happy to be in that region, including Grundee and Kankakee.

For the first time on Thursday, the state’s Northeast region met the medical benchmarks set by the Pritzker administration to potentially move from the second phase of the reopening plan to the third phase. That would allow some additional businesses to resume operations on a limited basis when the current stay-at-home order expires May 29.

Those metrics include a 19.9% testing positivity rate for the Northeast region, just barely hitting the 20% standard required by Pritzker’s office over a two-week period.

“Remember, they need to go through a time period, and there needs to be an averaging of those metrics,” Pritzker said.

All other regions previously had been on track to enter the third phase and are still in line to do so.

Meanwhile, health officials said another 138 people have died of COVID-19 in Illinois, raising the state’s death toll to 3,928. And newly reported 3,239 cases are among the 22,678 test results received by the state a day earlier.

In total, there have been 87,937 coronavirus cases confirmed in 99 of Illinois’ 102 counties since the pandemic hit the state.

More than 512,000 people have been tested overall, with the state’s rolling positive rate over the last week at about 17%, officials said.

With the latest cases reported on Thursday, Cook County overtook Queens County, New York, which reported 58,084 as of Thursday, according to data kept by Johns Hopkins University.

Cook County added 2,051 cases over the last 24 hours compared to 336 for Queens, which has fewer than half the number of residents compared to Cook County but a much higher population density.

But Illinois Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike called the increase in cases “a function of increasing our testing.

“No one has captured all cases of COVID-19 — they have captured all cases for which people have been tested,” Ezike said. “This is getting us closer to the actual numbers, but we’re far, far, far from having the actual numbers.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

J.B. Pritzker presented a blueprint for reopening the state, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle on Thursday unveiled her plans for what the county’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic will look like.

The “Cook County COVID-19 Response Plan: From Rapid Response to Equitable Recovery,” includes a Council on Digital Equity, which will oversee the county’s efforts to help bridge the digital divide for more than a quarter of county residents who lack high-speed internet or enough bandwidth to manage Zoom classes or handle other online tasks, Preckwinkle said in a livestreamed appearance before the City Club of Chicago.

The county is also launching a new open-learning platform in collaboration with the University of Chicago’s Office of Civic Engagement to provide six weeks of lectures for residents.

The county is moving ahead with its fair transit project, despite the pandemic causing transit ridership to fall.

That project, which was unveiled last year, continues the work of the county’s Department of Transportation and Highways with regional partners Metra, Pace and the CTA to bring “affordable, accessible transit” to more riders on the South Side of Chicago and in the south and southwest suburbs.

The CTA has not agreed yet to participate, but the county is in negotiations with Metra and hopes for a fall rollout.

The plan also includes a community advisory council composed of community leaders and advocates who are being recruited from across the county. They are to provide feedback from their communities on the effectiveness of the county’s plan and on existing gaps in services and explore potential areas for partnership with the county, the board president said. She hopes the council can begin meeting near the end of the month.

Cook County surpassed Queens, N.Y., as the county with most COVID-19 cases in the U.S. Thursday. Cook County, which has a population of 5.1 million, added 2,051 cases in the last 24 hours compared to 336 for the New York county, which has 2.25 million people.

Preckwinkle said the focus of the plan is on communities because the county has a “moral obligation to focus on equity as well” in its recovery efforts, which “must include everyone,” especially black and brown communities that have been “hit the hardest.”

“These initiatives address the root causes of inequity, including our community partners and residents and ensure that when Cook County recovers from this crisis, we will recover together,” Preckwinkle said. “Our recovery will encompass everyone, not just those who have the access to the most resources.”

The county’s response to the virus could change over the next two years as researchers work on developing a vaccine. Bill Barnes, the head of the county’s Emergency Management and Regional Security department, said the pandemic’s effect will “ebb and flow.”

“This is not a typical disaster where, say, a tornado strikes, and response is going in rescuing people, cleaning up debris and then transitioning to a clean recovery period where it’s rebuilding and restoring services,” Barnes said. “Here, we anticipate several waves of infections which are going to mean that we’re going to have to ramp up and down our recovery to respond to the situation on the ground. Simultaneously, there are going to be recovery actions because we can’t wait to begin the recovery actions until this is over, two years from now.”

Dr. Kiran Joshi, a co-director of the county’s Department of Public Health, said as cases decrease the county will step up its contact tracing efforts, which the county is planning for now.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Darin LaHood claimed Chicago accounts for the vast majority of the state’s COVID-19 cases.

“Peoria is not like Chicago,” LaHood told a CBS affiliate in Peoria. “Ninety-three percent of the cases in the state of Illinois have come from Chicago. … There has to be a tiered system, a more measured and a balanced approach.”

LaHood, a Republican who represents Illinois’ 18th Congressional District, which includes Peoria, made those remarks May 1 after Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker acknowledged some regions may be ready to reopen sooner than others depending on when they pass their peak.

While there’s no doubt major urban centers with large, concentrated populations have seen a higher number of confirmed positive cases, LaHood’s figure for Chicago — where about 20% of the state’s 12.7 million residents reside — seemed improbably high.

On the day he made his claim, the number of cases in Chicago had reached 22,700, about 40% of the state’s 56,000 cases at the time, according to data from the Illinois Department of Public Health. Chicago’s share of the total hasn’t varied much in the days since, the same dataset shows. LaHood’s own Peoria County has seen just 148 positive cases.

Debates over how and when to resume different kinds of business and other activities have raged across states as the nation continues to confront both a rising death toll and historic surges in unemployment.

Pritzker has since released a plan to gradually reopen Illinois that divides the state into four regions. None of the counties LaHood represents are included in the same region as Chicago. Some businesses, such as restaurants, would not open anywhere until the end of June at the earliest under the plan. LaHood said it’s “unrealistic” for downstate regions to wait that long.

When we asked LaHood’s office for evidence of his claim, a spokesperson indicated LaHood was referencing an area that included Chicago and the northern part of the state.

“Northern or upstate IL and Chicago, as of last week, accounted for approximately 93% of the cases, and ‘Northern’ was inadvertently left out during the interview,” a spokesman wrote in an email.

Asked if LaHood misspoke when he cited Chicago instead of “upstate” or “northern” Illinois, we got no response.

Had LaHood referred to counties in northern Illinois that include the Chicago metropolitan region, he would have found himself on much firmer ground. The vast majority of the state’s cases have occurred in Cook County and the five counties that surround it: DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will. Together, those six counties are home to about two-thirds of Illinois residents but accounted for 90% of the state’s COVID-19 cases as of May 13.

It’s common for residents outside of the Chicago area to refer to the significantly larger and more populous northeastern region collectively as “Chicago,” according to state political experts. But they said the inaccuracy reinforces regional stereotypes.

“If you’re already disposed to think of things as us versus them, then that’s reinforcing that narrative,” said Kent Redfield, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Illinois Springfield. “But it’s not precise, it’s not accurate. … If you’re referring to northeastern Illinois, then be specific about what you’re referring to.”

Our ruling

LaHood said 93% of COVID-19 cases in Illinois “have come from Chicago.”

Confirmed cases in Illinois’ largest city account for less than half of the state’s total cases, public health data show. That’s far from the figure LaHood cited during his TV appearance.

LaHood’s spokesperson said he was referring to the northern region of the state more broadly, but experts told us that’s no excuse.

We rate his claim False.

FALSE — The statement is not accurate.

It’s not a hoax’,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DDtE3XEyr4dN3Dn1mW4bkahhBVQ=/0x0:1082x566/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19968200/Screen_Shot_2020_05_13_at_3.13.18_PM.png,"Illinois saw its deadliest day yet from COVID-19, with another 192 Illinoisans losing their lives, officials said Wednesday.

It marks the highest death toll in a 24-hour period since the virus began its spread. And the dire numbers prompted Gov. J.B. Pritzker and his public health chief to offer some of their strongest words about the virus that has so far claimed 3,792 lives in Illinois.

“They’re not just numbers and statistics,” said Dr. Ngozi Ezike, head of the Illinois Public Health Department. “These are real people. and there are families and loved ones who are suffering with each of them, whether in their illness or in their unfortunate passing.”

The governor questioned how anyone could read those numbers any other way.

“One-hundred-ninety-two Illinoisans have lost their lives to this virus in the past 24 hours. 192. How is that not real to you?” Pritzker said to elected officials — and business owners — objecting to his stay-at-home order extension. “More people will get sick and admitted to the hospital and die if we don’t stay the course and follow the guidance the experts have provided.”

The Illinois Department of Public Health also reported 1,677 new cases, bringing the state’s total to 84,698. The state received 17,668 test results and has performed 489,359 total tests.

Wednesday also marked the 16th day with more than 100 lives lost, and resumed an especially deadly period for the virus in Illinois, bringing the number dead this month alone to 1,459.

The governor’s administration released new projections on Monday from researchers that indicate the state will see a range of 50 to 150 deaths a day into June or July. Northwestern University, one of three universities involved in the state’s projections, has predicted a more dire daily range of 50 to 300 deaths.

Ezike called on Illinoisans to be patient and keep following the guidelines, whether they know someone afflicted with the disease or not.

“This is a real disease. This is a serious disease. It’s not a hoax.

“And people need to take it very seriously. Please continue to stay home. Please maintain physical separation or social distancing. Please wear your masks.

“Please help us decrease the spread of this virus. And please help us save lives.”

Pritzker’s administration has said the deaths are a lagging indicator of the virus’ spread and are difficult to predict since the virus may affect people differently. Ezike last week said 90% of the fatalities in Illinois have been people with other chronic conditions including heart disease and diabetes. But the fact that Illinoisans are largely abiding by the stay-at-home order extension, and there are still a large number of fatalities is frustrating the many people stuck working at home, or worse, unemployed during the pandemic.

“Folks, I know this is hard. I know that people are hurting,” Pritzker said during his briefing. “This virus has taken many lives and destroyed many livelihoods. COVID-19 has turned our world upside down and stolen our sense of normalcy and stability. I want this to end as much as you do.”

The governor also on Wednesday said all residents and staff at the state’s four veterans homes have been tested for COVID-19. Pritzker said a coronavirus patient at the home in Manteno died. At Anna Veterans’ Home there have been five positive cases; in Manteno, 30 residents and 19 employees who tested positive. At the LaSalle Veterans’ Home, there has been one positive case. None have been reported at the Quincy Veterans’ Home.

At the state’s nursing homes, the public health department is testing all residents and staffers, even without known outbreaks. Tests are also being provided for all employees with known cases. So far, there have been 30,000 tests provided to 129 facilities.

The state as of Friday had lost 1,553 nursing home residents to COVID-19. The public health department has been updating those figures once a week.

Pritzker this week has been delivering his daily briefing from his home office after a senior staffer tested positive for the coronavirus. The governor said he himself has tested negative twice for coronavirus.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Tuesday also marked a record-high number of new cases — 4,014 — although Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s office said that positive count came from 29,266 tests results. That’s the most the state has ever received back in a day. Pritzker said more than 20,000 were performed within 24 hours, marking a new record for the state in testing.

“There is a proportionality there, that as you test more, you’re going to get more positives from within those additional tests,” Illinois Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said.

The state has now seen 83,021 positive cases, as the virus remains in 98 of 102 counties. Illinois has received 471,691 total tests back since the pandemic began, health officials said.

Illinois’ positivity rate is 18% from May 2 to May 9. That metric is being looked at under a magnifying glass since Pritzker included it as one of several numbers needed under 20% in his regional reopening plan.

The total number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care units was down by 33 from Sunday to Monday. During that same timeframe, there was no change in ventilator use, although the number of total COVID-19 patients entering hospitals went up by 307, the governor’s office said.

Tuesday’s fatality count is higher than the previous two days, when the state saw fewer than 100 deaths each day. The governor’s administration released new projections a day earlier from researchers that indicate the state will see a range of 50 to 150 deaths into June or July. Northwestern University, one of three universities involved in the state’s projections, has predicted a more dire range of 50 to 300 deaths.

But Pritzker signaled some optimism on Monday in revealing three of four regions in his reopening plan are “on pace” to potentially enter a new phase of reopening when his latest stay-at-home order expires on May 29.

The governor on Tuesday said he is speaking with the governors in nearby Midwestern states, some of whom are already reopening businesses.

“We are sharing ideas and making sure that we’re following best practices. It is different from one state to another. Indiana is a different state than Illinois. We have different concerns and Michigan’s different as well,” Pritzker said. “...Each of us have different timetables. It’s again based a lot on at least or Illinois and a lot of the other states, based on health care metrics.”

Pritzker, however, said he is concerned about Illinoisans traveling to neighboring states.

“I am concerned because I think that in many ways that opening too early or the potential spread of the virus in those states will affect our metrics in Illinois,” Pritzker said. “I understand that people may cross over the border, but I think they should take into account the danger, the potential anyway, of the spread of the virus and their ability to carry that virus back over the border when they come back.”

Facing some pushback against his order extension, Pritzker said he “would consider” withholding federal aid or taking other actions like revoking liquor licenses against local leaders and businesses who disobey the directive, as Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf has threatened to do in that state.

“I would just suggest that there are a number of enforcement mechanisms that are available to us. And I don’t want to utilize those. I have asked people to do the right thing and I want to point out that the vast majority of people in Illinois have been doing the right thing and I’m so very proud of that,” Pritzker said, calling opponents of the stay-at-home order “outliers.”

Journigans is among 120 employees of Trinity Services Inc. who during the COVID-19 pandemic have moved into residential facilities for developmentally disabled individuals in Illinois to reduce the risk of transmitting the disease.

Instead of eight or nine different staff members a day coming and going across three eight-hour shifts at the Joliet care home where he works, Journigans and two other women left their own homes behind to live 24/7 at the facility for a month.

Opinion

“At first I wasn’t interested,” said Journigans, 63, who normally lives with his sister in Lockport. “It worked out pretty good.”

It’s quite a personal sacrifice, albeit one that comes with additional compensation of overtime pay and bonuses.

The sacrifice also is made easier by the special relationships that often exist between residents and workers.

“You develop bonds with them. I always worry about them. Basically, we are their family,” he said.

The so-called “stay in place” approach requires workers to cut themselves off physically from the community, almost as if they were working on an oil well at sea.

The idea is that the coronavirus cases plaguing nursing homes and other group living arrangements usually are brought into those settings by asymptomatic staff members who do not realize they are carrying the virus.

By reducing the number of people going in and out of a building, officials at Trinity hoped to limit the potential exposure to residents.

It appears to have worked. Only six individuals have tested positive for COVID-19 with just one death across Trinity’s 100 facilities housing 650 clients.

Nobody has become sick at the Joliet intermediate care facility where Journigans has spent the past month caring for its 14 residents.

Fifty-one of Trinity’s 100 homes, including all eight in Chicago, are using the stay-in-place staffing system.

Other Illinois service providers to the developmentally disabled have adopted similar approaches after learning about Trinity’s efforts, said Thane Dykstra, chief executive officer of the non-profit organization.

Dykstra said staying in place has worked well for residents but has been difficult for employees.

“I think people are glad when they come out. It’s a lot of work,” he said.

In addition, some struggled with missing family events such as Easter and Mother’s Day. Another couldn’t be there when a family member died.

“It’s been challenging for folks, but a lot of them understand the value and the difference they’ve made for our program participants,” Dykstra said.

Journigans and his co-workers are known as “direct support professionals” or DSPs, a notoriously low-paid line of work involving some of society’s most dedicated caregivers.

As I have written previously, caregivers in these settings don’t have the luxury of social distancing. In many cases, they have to help residents eat, bathe and dress. They also have to prepare the food and clean.

Starting pay is $10.10 an hour. The state reimburses providers such as Trinity at $13 an hour. The low pay rate is a constant problem because it makes it difficult to recruit and retain workers.

“We’ve lost so many fabulous workers, and the only reason they left was because of money,” said Journigans, who is president of his AFSCME local union.

Since shutting himself in at the Joliet facilty, Journigans said he’s worked 16 to 17 hours a day on average, which means he’s piling up 80 to 90 hours of overtime per week — at time and a half. Employees are not paid for the time they are sleeping. He’ll receive a $2,000 bonus for completing the 30 days — and another $2,000 when he finishes the additional 15 days.

Dykstra said Trinity is able to temporarily afford the bonuses because the state is continuing to pay for the day program the agency normally provides but can’t during the shutdown. Given the staff shortages, overtime costs are always present, he said.

Residents of the Joliet home have been diagnosed with Down syndrome, autism and other developmental disabilities. They range in age from 29 to 65.

All are mobile, although some are in wheelchairs. Not everyone speaks, but “most understand what you’re saying,” Journigans said.

Journigans came to this line of work as a young man after being laid off from a factory job and found that it changed him for the better, teaching both patience and empathy.

He takes his sense of accomplishment in the small things, such as teaching a 60-year-old man how to tie his own shoes for the first time.

Facing what it says are losses of $10 million, Navy Pier Inc. says the loan from the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program will cover expenses and the salaries of 147 employees, some who have been “sidelined” since the pier was shut down in March by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The federal loan will be used to cover all salaries, including that of Marilyn Kelly Gardner, the Navy Pier Inc. president and chief executive officer whose salary, bonus and other compensation totaled $541,051 in 2018, according to records filed with the Internal Revenue Service.

The company’s board of directors, which includes former Mayor Richard M. Daley’s daughter, spends more than $3 million a year on pay for Gardner and seven other top employees. That includes $419,204 for chief operating officer Brian Murphy, a former Chicago cop who was Daley’s deputy chief of staff, and $258,816 for vice president of operations Michael Degnan, the son of longtime Daley political adviser Timothy Degnan.

The pier’s payroll topped $15.4 million for 2018, the most recent data available.

The $2,489,500 loan “made it possible for us to resume work and payroll from some employees who had been sidelined prior to receiving the loan,” according to Navy Pier Inc. spokeswoman Payal Patel. “Unlike other similar cultural institutions sitting on public land in Chicago, the pier does not have an endowment nor does it receive any monetary support from any government entity. Ninety percent of Navy Pier’s revenue is realized through earned operating income, and the balance is generated through philanthropy.”

Navy Pier Inc. does get a big break on rent, though. It pays the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois just $1 a year to lease the pier, which is the state’s largest tourist attraction.

The PPP loans cover about 10 weeks of expenses and won’t have to be repaid as long as the companies don’t cut their workforces.

Illinois businesses, including the parent company of the Chicago Sun-Times, secured about 69,000 loans through April 16 totaling $15.9 billion, according to SBA data.

Navy Pier was long run by the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority, a government agency established by the city and the state to oversee the pier and also to operate McCormick Place. In 2011 as Daley was soon to leave City Hall, he agreed to a deal, approved by Illinois legislators, to allow the authority to lease the pier to the newly created Navy Pier Inc., run by Daley allies including his daughter Nora Daley Conroy.

Navy Pier’s operators, past and present, have a history of making deals with politically connected people and businesses, giving them lucrative contracts to operate restaurants and shops and other attractions that together lure 9 million visitors a year to the pier.

Who got those deals was public information when McPier ran Navy Pier. Now, the not-for-profit’s board says the public no longer is entitled to know the terms of those lucrative contracts.

The Better Government Association has sued for such access. Cook County Circuit Judge Thomas Allen threw out the suit, but the BGA has appealed to the Illinois Appellate Court.

In 2018, Navy Pier Inc. lost nearly $5.5 million, primarily because its revenue declined to $56.5 million from $65.3 million the previous year.

At the end of 2018, Navy Pier Inc. owed $57.9 million in bonds and construction loans. It’s required to pay slightly more than $3 million on those debts this year.

With Illinois residents still sheltering at home while non-essential businesses remain closed under orders from Gov. J.B. Pritzker, there’s no timetable for Navy Pier to reopen or to resume its weekly fireworks displays along the lakefront.

“We got to be open to the public as soon as this thing lifts,” according to a source familiar with Navy Pier’s operations, who says the hope is that the government money will allow that to happen.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Once the Illinois Secretary of State’s Driver Services facilities do reopen, residents will have 90 days to renew their expired vehicle registrations. Also put on hold is the requirement for drivers in the Chicago and Metro East regions to get their vehicles’ emissions tested before they renew their registrations.

In March, Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White announced the closure of driver services facilities across the state, as the country braced for the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, it’s not known when driver services facilities will open again, a spokesman for the office said.

But any drivers who have already met the requirements can renew their registrations online.

“We encourage people who are not due [for an emissions test] to get the sticker online,” said Dave Druker, a secretary of state spokesman.

And that could mean 50 to 150 Illinoisans losing their lives to the coronavirus a day – or possibly as many as 300 each day.

Those were some of the grim estimates Gov. J.B. Pritzker delivered from his own home on Monday, a mix of troubling projections coupled with a few optimistic signs of progress for parts of the state outside the Chicago area.

The daily death toll Monday was 54, at the low end of the projections for the peak period. But that follows an especially deadly week, and it was announced amid a new round of scientific modeling.

And those dire projections come at an extremely inopportune time for the Democratic governor, who is facing criticism from Republican legislators, unemployed workers who appear stuck in limbo and President Donald Trump.

It also comes as many in Illinois are suffering from cabin fever, growing increasingly restless over their lives having been disrupted for more than eight weeks.

For the first time Monday, Pritzker delivered his daily briefing from his home office — a drawing of his late mother behind him — as he broadcast live after a senior staffer tested positive for coronavirus. The governor said he himself has tested negative twice for coronavirus.

The governor also offered some good news along with his bad news projections. After announcing his reopening plan last week that divides the state into four regions and evaluates phases of re-openings based on health metrics, Pritzker said all regions except for the Northeast region “are on pace” to be able to move to the next phase come May 29, the last day of the stay-at-home executive order.

The next phase, Phase 3, allows a number of businesses to reopen, with the use of “face coverings as the norm,” including non-essential manufacturing and some non-essential businesses, including barber shops and salons.

But in the Northeast region, home to Chicago and Cook County, the positivity rate — the number of positive cases compared to tests taken — remains too high. Still, the governor signaled there’s still time to get that number lower. His plan in part entails 14 days of a positivity rate under 20%.

In total, 3,459 people have died of coronavirus in Illinois — 803 of them last week. As of Monday, the state also reported 1,266 new cases, bringing the total of positive cases to 79,007. The state received 12,441 tests results.

In late April, Pritzker’s office released a COVID-19 projection and worst-case fatality scenario based on scientific modeling that predicted a range of 50 to 150 deaths per day into early May. That projection was created by researchers from the Illinois Department of Public Health, as well as researchers from Northwestern University, the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The latest projection shows Illinois is indeed in a peak period for coronavirus deaths, but it’s less like a peak and more like a plateau.

The death range remains between 50 and 150 a day in models from both the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Northwestern University, however, is projecting a range of 50 to 300 daily deaths. The University of Chicago predicts the state seeing a death plateau until July, while both Northwestern and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are predicting it could last until June.

Beginning on April 23, the state saw 11 days in that originally predicted death range. On May 4, 46 deaths were reported. On May 5, the state saw its worst day with 176 fatalities. And since May 6, the state has consistently seen between 50 and 150 deaths a day, which is what the modelers predicted.

“We haven’t passed our peak yet. We have seen more stability in our numbers, but so far, we are not seeing significant declines in key metrics like hospitalization,” Pritzker said. “The updates to our models reflect that data.”

Pritzker said the time frame of “plateauing near a peak” into mid-May “has been expanded from mid-May into mid-June.”

“In many ways, this news is disheartening,” Pritzker said. “We have made great progress, but it’s forced us to remain at a moderated though still high level of key metrics for this extended period. A pushing out of our estimated peak is a natural consequence of flattening the curve. Remember that no one can truly stop this virus without a vaccine. But what we’ve been aiming to do since early March is slow down the exponential rate of transmission.”

The slowing down, he said, has helped health care workers to treat those with coronavirus and give pharmaceutical researchers time to develop effective treatments and ultimately a vaccine.

“Pushing the peak down and therefore to a longer time frame might not sound like good news to some, but I promise you it is saving lives,” Pritzker said.

The number of COVID-19 patients entering ICU beds went up by 16, from Saturday to Sunday night, according to Pritzker’s office. The number of ventilators being used by coronavirus patients also increased by 21, and the total number of COVID-19 patients increased by 26 patients.

The positivity rate statewide as of Monday is 10.17%. In the Northeast region, which includes Cook County and Chicago, the positivity rate is about 22%.

Meanwhile, Pritzker’s administration said the state has not yet received a shipment of swabs and viral transport media from the federal government. That shipment was anticipated in early May but has not yet arrived. The governor’s administration is also asking for federal help in obtaining surgical gowns, which are going fast, they said.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Pritzker’s senior staff has tested positive for COVID-19, and all staffers — including the governor — will work from home for an “appropriate isolation period,” the governor announced on Monday.

The staff member — whom Pritzker acknowledged worked “down the hall” from him and attended daily meetings with him — was asymptomatic but tested positive late last week.

All of Pritzker’s senior staffers were tested last week and the Democratic governor and the rest of the staffers have tested negative. Pritzker was tested once again early Sunday and tested negative, his office said.

“One member of my senior staff who was not exhibiting any symptoms has tested positive for COVID-19 and for that reason, in accordance with the best public health practices and protocol, and recommendations of doctors, the rest of the team, myself included, is working from home,” Pritzker said during a briefing in his Chicago home on Monday afternoon.

Pritzker did not disclose the identify of the staffer, citing a potential breach of privacy. But he said the staff member did not attend any of the daily COVID-19 press briefings.

For more than eight weeks, 20 senior members have been regularly reporting in person to work downtown at the James R. Thompson Center. The employees have used safety protocols such as daily temperature checks, wearing face coverings and social distancing.

Those staffers were also not frequenting stores and were being told to only go home and back to the Thompson Center. The senior staffers met at least once a day collectively, and during those meetings they wore face coverings, including the governor, according to Pritzker spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh.

When it was time to eat, staffers ate individually packaged food, she said. The senior staffers worked at the Thompson Center from about 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. to varying degrees. Abudayyeh said the staffer who tested positive has not been present at Pritzker’s news conferences.

Now, Pritzker will be livestreaming his 2:30 p.m. COVID-19 briefings from his Chicago home, and without any staffers present to help, Abudayyeh said. Dr. Ngozi Ezike, the head of the Illinois Department of Public Health, will also join via a video chat. And a print and broadcast reporter will also be added to the line.

The governor’s office is also undergoing a deep cleaning, and staffers are being monitored for symptoms.

“The governor and staff will return to the office when IDPH deems appropriate,” the governor’s office said, referring to the Illinois Department of Public Health.

COVID-19 has also impacted the White House and some of its staffers. Katie Miller, press secretary to Vice President Mike Pence, on Friday was removed from Air Force One after testing positive. Miller is married to Stephen Miller, a top adviser to President Donald Trump.

The Washington Post featured a photo of Katie Miller speaking to reporters Thursday outside a nursing home in Alexandra, Virginia. Katie Miller was not wearing a face covering. Four reporters surrounding her were.

The White House last week also confirmed one of Trump’s personal valets has tested positive for coronavirus.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The weekend marked the first time in eight weeks in which Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Ezike didn’t stand before the cameras for daily COVID-19 briefings. Instead, Ezike — a mother of four — spent her Sunday delivering a lengthy sermon for Hope Church via their Facebook page.

“This Mother’s Day is especially challenging. That’s putting it ever so mildly,” Ezike said. “No one will ever forget Mother’s Day 2020.”

“Many of us can’t visit and celebrate this day in person with our mothers in the traditional way. For some, a visit would be putting our loved mother, our beloved mother, at risk of contracting this virus that we’ve all become intimately aware of,” Ezike said. “Some of our mothers are in a nursing home, where visitation is now banned, again, for their safety. Maybe your mother is no longer with us on this side of Earth.”

The state has lost 3,406 people to COVID-19, including 1,553 in the nursing homes.

“And then there are over 1,000 mothers that we have lost in Illinois alone to this awful coronavirus in just the last two months,” Ezike said.

Ezike said her spirituality helped her cope with the loss of her father, who died in February in California just before the pandemic began its rapid spread. And the health director said she’s “running on fumes with little to no sleep” and is humbled and grateful to be leading the state’s response to the virus.

Ezike heads the state’s Department of Public Health after being the Cook County Juvenile Detention Center’s medical director during 15 years working for Cook County Health. An internist and pediatrician, she oversaw medical care at the Cook County Juvenile Detention Center during the 2009 H1N1 flu virus pandemic.

“Who am I to even be here before you? A daughter of poor African immigrants, born in California, and now leading the state of Illinois through a pandemic, the likes of which we haven’t seen in 100 years,” Ezike said. “The impossible becomes possible when you see that God is in it. The fact that I’m involved in this pandemic with all my imperfections flaring and glaring is just because I am part of his perfect plan.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

In a May 4 interview with CNN, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi shot back with her own assessment of Illinois’ financial straits.

“Look at him saying these states want to be bailed out,” Pelosi told host Wolf Blitzer. “The state that he used as an example was Illinois, which got into fiscal problems because of a Republican governor who was governor there until Gov. Pritzker has come to pull it out.”

The National Governors Association sent a bipartisan letter to Congress in April that made clear the financial pressure caused by COVID-19 is being felt by states nationwide, not just in blue states as Trump has said.

But what about Pelosi’s assessment of how Illinois got itself into a financial bind?

Her comment suggests Illinois’ hardships are a matter of recent history, dating back just a few years to the time of Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s Republican predecessor. State finance experts say that’s misleading.

Rauner’s role

Understanding what Pelosi was referencing requires a brief detour into recent state history.

In November 2014, Illinoisans elected Republican Bruce Rauner as governor. Rauner, a private equity investor and political newcomer, reached an impasse with Democrats who control the Legislature over how to run the state. That left Illinois without a spending plan for two years.

With government spending left operating largely on autopilot, social services suffered, public universities laid off thousands of employees and the state’s pile of unpaid bills tripled, causing credit rating agencies to reduce Illinois’ rating to near-junk status.

As the state’s chief executive, Rauner played a starring role in the showdown that caused the budget crisis. But he had plenty of co-stars among the state’s leading Democrats, including longtime House Speaker Michael Madigan, who has exerted influence over every state budget for the past four decades.

Democratic leadership also allowed a temporary state income tax increase to expire days before Rauner was sworn into office in 2015, leaving the state with even less cash to make ends meet during the crisis. Rauner had urged the Legislature to let it lapse before taking office, and Madigan along with then Senate President John Cullerton obliged despite warnings from then Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn, who lost to Rauner in 2014.

A legacy of fiscal mismanagement

Foisting all the blame for the state’s unprecedented budget crisis on Rauner isn’t the only problem with Pelosi’s narrative. That’s because the tale of how Illinois dug itself into a fiscal hole dates back much further than his single term in office.

When we raised this with Pelosi’s office, a spokesman responded with an email saying she was “clearly referencing the fact that Illinois’ situation greatly worsened” under Rauner — not that he alone was responsible for the state’s fiscal woes.

But experts interpreted her statement differently.

“To claim that this is a problem created by Gov. Rauner is clearly misleading,” said David Merriman, an economist who heads the Fiscal Futures Project at the University of Illinois’ Institute of Government & Public Affairs. “It’s a problem that’s developed over decades.”

Illinois governors and lawmakers from both parties have long managed to increase government spending without raising the revenue needed to support it.

“For many, many years we’ve provided more goods and services … than our revenues would support,” said Charles N. Wheeler III, who has studied decades of state budgets as both a journalist and professor at the University of Illinois Springfield. “It’s always easier for lawmakers to fund programs than it is to raise the revenues to cover it.”

Indeed, the alarm bells began sounding long before Rauner took office. A 2011 report from the state comptroller’s office warned of a looming financial crisis created by many years of rampant spending. The report cautioned that the recession at the time had exacerbated the state’s ongoing failures to reduce its debt, build up its emergency reserves, or contribute enough to state employee pension funds.

And when it comes to pensions, Illinois’ problems date back even further. In 1917, a report commissioned by the General Assembly was already warning the funds were “moving toward crisis” due to inadequate payments from the state.

“We’ve been shortchanging the pensions for more than a hundred years,” Wheeler said.

Our ruling

Pelosi said Illinois “got into fiscal problems because of a Republican governor who was governor there” before Pritzker.

Illinois’ financial situation did worsen during Rauner’s term while the state operated without a spending plan for an unprecedented two years, but he wasn’t solely to blame. What’s more, the state was already teetering on the brink when he took office because of decisions made by leaders from both parties dating back decades.

But how do individual states within the U.S. compare with one another?

That’s a subject Mayor Lori Lightfoot raised at a news conference while highlighting the need for increased testing capacity in Illinois to respond to the outbreak.

“Illinois lags way behind all of our neighbors and certainly we’re in the bottom tier of states that are doing testing because of the availability,” Lightfoot said on April 7. “It’s not for lack of desire, it’s for lack of the tests themselves, the reagents, some of the other materials that we need to be able to process the tests.”

Illinois, like many states, has struggled to expand testing due to the national shortage of tests and other supplies. And while the numbers are improving, Gov. J.B. Pritzker has said the state is still falling short of the goal he set for performing 10,000 tests per day. In an interview aired on April 14, the governor said the state is now conducting almost 8,000.

But Illinois is not unique in the testing challenges it is facing, so we wondered whether the state was really as far behind as Lightfoot suggested.

In response to our inquiry, a spokeswoman for the mayor’s office acknowledged testing figures have improved somewhat from several weeks ago, but provided a March 27 report from ABC 7 that found more than half of all states had done more testing than Illinois had after accounting for population size, including neighboring Wisconsin.

Those results were based on data from March 26 — almost two weeks before the mayor made her comparison. Given how rapidly testing data are fluctuating, we decided to evaluate her claim based on more recent figures.

To do that, we turned to data from the COVID Tracking Project, a source Lightfoot’s office pointed to in a later response.

The project, which is managed and updated by volunteer journalists and scientists, gathers data from state health departments around the country and provides figures on the total number of tests conducted by both public and commercial labs.

Its database shows Lightfoot was partly right and partly wrong when she said Illinois was testing at a rate that put it behind all its neighbors as well as in the “bottom tier” nationwide.

The day Lightfoot made her claim, Illinois ranked 28 out of all 50 states for testing on a per capita basis, figures from the project show. Its ranking has improved only slightly in the time since, with the state coming in 24th as of April 14. Its current tally of just over 110,600 total tests comes out to about 8,730 tests per million residents. New York, which tops the list, has run more than 25,650 tests per million.

But Lightfoot’s Illinois comparison doesn’t hold when it comes to the states it borders. On the day she made her claim, Illinois came out slightly ahead of Wisconsin, Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana and Iowa. And in the days since, its lead has continued to grow.

Given how frequently testing figures change — along with differences in the ways states report their data — that lead in the Midwest may not mean much. But it’s enough to show Lightfoot is incorrect in her assertion that Illinois is trailing the region.

Our ruling

Lightfoot said, “Illinois lags way behind all of our neighbors and certainly we’re in the bottom tier of states that are doing testing.”

At the time Lightfoot made her statement, Illinois did lag a majority of states nationally in terms of the share of its population that had been tested for COVID-19, according to data compiled by an independent reporting project.

But the same dataset shows Illinois tested — and continues to test — more residents per capita than the states it borders.

We rate Lightfoot’s claim Half True.

HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Trump expressed his confidence in the test from the north suburban drug manufacturer after a preliminary study by New York University researchers reported problems with it. Trump and his deputies have have promoting the 15-minute test as a “game changer.”

The Food and Drug Administration said late Thursday it was investigating preliminary data suggesting the Abbott test can miss COVID-19 cases, falsely clearing infected patients.

“Abbott is a great test; it’s a very quick test,” Trump said at a Rose Garden event to highlight his administration’s efforts to develop a vaccine for the virus. “And it can always be very rapidly double checked.”

The test is used daily at the White House to test Trump, key members of his staff as well as any visitor to the White House complex who comes in close proximity to the president or Vice President Mike Pence.

“We’ve got to get to the bottom of it, but we still have confidence in the test or we wouldn’t have it on the market,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told Fox Business Network.

White House officials on Friday continued using the Abbot ID Now test. Reporters at the White House underwent the test before Trump’s Rose Garden event. The president noted that the administration officials and staff around him, not all of whom were wearing masks, also had undergone testing Friday.

Trump, who also did not wear a mask, was asked why not everyone was wearing a face covering.

“I’ve been tested, we’ve all been tested and we’re quite a distance away, and we’re outdoors,” said Trump. “I told them I gave them the option they can wear it or not.”

Azar described the FDA warning as a routine announcement that comes after medical manufacturers submit any type of negative information about their product.

Trump has praised the Abbott test as “very quick, very good” and alluded to the tests helping keep him safe.

FDA commissioner Steve Hahn said that if a person is suspected of having the disease caused by the coronavirus, “it might be worth, if the test is negative, getting a second confirmatory test. That’s what our guidance is about.”

Hahn, asked on CBS on Friday whether he’d continue to recommend using the test at the White House, said, “That will be a White House decision.” But he said the test is on the market and the FDA continues to “recommend its use or to have it available for use.”

Federal health officials have been alerting doctors to the potential inaccuracy in the test, which is used at thousands of hospitals, clinics and testing sites across the United States.

The FDA warning came a day after New York University researchers reported results suggesting Abbott’s test can miss up to half the infections caught by a rival test made by Cepheid. The research has not been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal and was based on about 100 patients.

The researchers found that Abbott’s test, run on the company’s portable ID NOW system, missed one-third of the infections caught by Cepheid’s test when swabs were stored in liquid used to transport laboratory samples. When the samples were kept dry the test missed 48% of the cases flagged by Cepheid’s test.

The researchers called the test’s performance “unacceptable,” due to the risk of falsely clearing patients who could spread the infection to others. They acknowledged shortcomings of the study, including the time needed to transport patient samples to the device for processing.

Abbott rejected the findings, saying the researchers used the test “in ways that it was not designed to be used.”

“ID NOW is intended to be used near the patient with a direct swab test method,” the company said in a statement.

The company pointed to other independent study results that found the test accurately detected 90% or more infections.

Last month Abbott changed the instructions for its test to explicitly warn against putting patient samples in transport chemicals. The update came after researchers at the Cleveland Clinic reported a 15% false negative rate for samples stored in the chemicals.

The FDA said it was reviewing the data with Abbott and was working on a letter to health care providers about potential accuracy issues. The agency said physicians may need to confirm the results of a negative Abbott test if patients have symptoms of the virus. Regulators said they are requiring Abbott to conduct follow-up studies on the test’s accuracy.

Federal contracting data show the White House spent $140,666 on the Abbott rapid test kits in April. The Department of Heath and Human Services also paid more than $27.3 million last month for the problematic Abbott tests",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Dick Durbin visited Stroger Hospital Friday morning, calling the hospital the “frontline of a battle against COVID-19” ahead of a potential vote on a bill that could provide another round of funding for testing.

The battle against the deadly coronavirus should include more money for testing, Durbin said, standing outside of tents that serve as walk-up and drive-thru testing sites for county health patients and employees on the hospital grounds.

“The good news is that there’s $483 million coming into the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago from that federal appropriation that was announced last night with the Centers for Disease Control,” the Springfield Democrat said.

“That is money that will be used for testing — we absolutely, positively need to have even more. A new bill before Congress that may be voted on today could provide another $75 billion for testing, and when the president stands up and says ‘we have prevailed over COVID-19,’ he is just flat out wrong. ... This is still a battle that we have to win.”

Half of the 250 patients at the county’s marquee hospital have COVID-19, Debra Carey, Cook County Health’s interim CEO, said. Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle said caring for those who seek the county’s help, sometimes without a means to pay for the care they receive, has proved a “tremendous challenge” for the health care system.

“This health and hospital system has served our county for 180 years. It’s always taken in anyone who comes through our doors regardless of their race or gender, sexual orientation, immigration status or ability to pay,” Preckwinkle said. “And this challenge, this pandemic challenge, just reflects the incredible health inequities that we see in our county and our country ... This is not a red state or a blue state issue, local government all across the country are hurting.”

The county is already facing a $200 million revenue shortfall because of the pandemic’s effect on the economy, and yesterday the county reached a grim milestone, surpassing Queens County in New York as the U.S. county with the most coronavirus cases Thursday, based on a Sun-Times analysis of the latest public data.

As of Thursday, there were 58,457 total cases of COVID-19 recorded in Cook County, which includes all of Chicago and many suburbs, after officials added 2,051 new cases in the last 24 hours. Queens, by comparison, added only 336 cases over the same time frame to bring its total to 58,084.

Durbin said more federal help would be needed to help lower the coronavirus case load.

“If we are going to fight this successfully, spare people suffering and death, if we’re going to reopen this economy, we can’t announce we have prevailed,” Durbin said. “We have not prevailed, [the] battle still continues, but testing is critical to prevailing, this $483 million to our state will help. We need more.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Democrats are eagerly embracing Obama as a political wingman for Joe Biden, who spent two terms by his side as vice president. Obama remains the party’s most popular figure, particularly with black voters and younger Democrats, and Biden’s presidential campaign is planning for him to have a highly visible role in the months to come.

For President Donald Trump, that means an opportunity to focus the spotlight on one of his favorite political foils. In recent days, Trump and his allies have aggressively pushed conspiracy theories about Obama designed to fire up the president’s conservative base, taint Biden by association and distract from the glut of grim health and economic news from the coronavirus pandemic.

“Partisans on both sides want to make this about Obama,” said Ned Price, who served as spokesperson for Obama’s White House National Security Council.

The renewed political focus on Obama sets the stage for an election about the nation’s future that will also be about its past. As Biden looks to Obama for personal validation, he’s also running to restore some of the former president’s legacy, which has been systematically dismantled by Trump. The current president is running in part to finish that job.

Yet Trump’s anti-Obama push also frequently takes on a darker, more conspiratorial tone that goes far beyond differences in health care policy and America’s role in the world. His current focus is on the actions Obama, Biden and their national security advisers took in the closing days of their administration, as they viewed intelligence reports about Michael Flynn. Flynn had a short-lived stint as Trump’s national security adviser before being fired for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his interactions with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S.

Trump’s own administration acknowledged on Wednesday that Obama advisers followed proper procedures in privately “unmasking” Flynn’s name, which was redacted in the intelligence reports for privacy reasons. Flynn ultimately pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, though Trump’s Justice Department moved last week to drop the case against him.

Despite there being no evidence of wrongdoing by Obama, Biden or other administration officials, Trump is eagerly pushing the notion of an unspecified crime against the former president, branding it “Obamagate.” He’s being backed up by Republican allies, including Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley who took to the Senate floor this week to ask of the Flynn matter: “What did Obama and Biden know, and when did they know it?”

Trump’s zeal has sparked fears among some former Obama and Biden advisers about how far he may be willing to go in using the levers of government to push his case against them in an election year. The Justice Department is conducting an investigation into the origins of the Russia probe that ensnared Flynn and other Trump associates.

Trump’s renewed focus on Obama comes as Republicans grow increasingly anxious that the rising coronavirus death toll and cratering economy will damage the president’s reelection prospects in November. More than 84,000 Americans have died from the virus, and more than 30 million have claimed unemployment.

Biden’s campaign drew a direct connection between the president’s attacks on Obama and the twin crises battering his administration.

“It’s no surprise that the president is erratically lashing out at President Obama, desperate to distract from his own failures as commander in chief that have cost thousands of Americans their lives during this crisis,” said TJ Ducklo, a Biden campaign spokesman.

Trump’s emphasis on Obama also comes as the former president begins to emerge from a three-year period of political restraint as he prepares to embrace his role as leading surrogate for Biden. Last week, Obama told a large gathering of alumni from his administration that DOJ’s decision to drop the Flynn case put the “rule of law at risk.” He also criticized the Trump White House’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

Biden’s campaign has been eager to get Obama involved in the election, though his exact role is still forming, particularly given that the pandemic has upended the campaign’s plans for rallies and other in-person events in battleground states. The former president is also expected to campaign for Democratic House and Senate candidates across the country.

Though Obama campaigned for Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterms, he has mostly tried to avoid overt politics since leaving the White House. He’s spoken out publicly against Trump on rare occasions, frustrating many Democrats who have wanted him to be more aggressive in calling out his successor.

But the 2020 election has always loomed as the moment when Obama would step off the sidelines, and he’s told advisers he’s eager to do so. Despite his strident public neutrality during the Democratic primary, he spoke to Biden regularly and has continued to do so as the campaign moves into the general election, according to aides.

Biden’s campaign sees Obama as a clear asset as they seek to not only energize Democrats,but to also appeal to independents and more moderate Republicans who may be wary of four more years of Trump in the White House.

A recent Monmouth University poll found 57% of Americans say they have a favorable opinion of Obama. That includes 92% of Democrats and 19% of Republicans.

Obama’s favorable ratings are higher than either of the men who will be on the ballot in November. The same poll showed 41% of Americans had a favorable opinion of Biden, and 40% viewed Trump in a favorable light.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

A joint statement says China’s efforts pose a “significant threat” to the health care, pharmaceutical and research sectors.

The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency says it would release technical details of the threat in the coming days and asked organizations to report any suspicious activity.

Manafort, 71, was released Wednesday morning from FCI Loretto, a low-security prison in Pennsylvania, according to his attorney, Todd Blanche. Manafort had been serving more than seven years in prison following his conviction.

His lawyers had asked the Bureau of Prisons to release him to home confinement, arguing that he was at high risk for coronavirus because of his age and preexisting medical conditions. Manafort was hospitalized in December with a heart-related condition, two people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press at the time. They were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.

Manafort was among the first people to be charged in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, which examined possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election campaign.

Manafort, who was prosecuted in two federal courts, was convicted by a jury in federal court in Virginia in 2018 and later pleaded guilty in Washington. He was sentenced last March and was immediately hit with state charges in New York after prosecutors accused him of giving false information on a mortgage loan application. A New York judge threw out state mortgage fraud charges, ruling that the criminal case was too similar to one that already landed Manafort in prison. Prosecutors have pledged to appeal.

Manafort’s release comes as prison advocates and congressional leaders have been pressing the Justice Department for weeks to release at-risk inmates before a potential outbreak in the system. They argue that the public health guidance to stay 6 feet (1.8 meters) away from other people is nearly impossible behind bars.

Attorney General William Barr ordered the agency in March and April to increase the use of home confinement and expedite the release of eligible high-risk inmates, beginning at three prisons identified as coronavirus hot spots. There are no confirmed coronavirus cases at FCI Loretto.

As of Tuesday, 2,818 federal inmates and 262 BOP staff members had positive test results for COVID-19 at federal prisons across the country. Fifty inmates had died.

The bureau has given contradictory and confusing guidance how it is deciding who is released to home confinement in an effort to combat the virus, changing requirements, setting up inmates for release and backing off and refusing to explain how it decides who gets out and when.

Under the bureau’s guidelines, priority is supposed to be given to those inmates who have served half of their sentence or inmates with 18 months or less left and who served at least 25% of their time. The bureau has discretion about who can be released.

Manafort, who was jailed in June 2018, does not meet those qualifications, and the bureau did not answer questions about why Manafort was being released.

Other high-profile inmates such as Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen and lawyer Michael Avenatti, who rose to fame representing porn star Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against Trump, have been released.

An agency spokeswoman said more than 2,400 inmates have been moved to home confinement since March 26, when Barr first issued a home confinement memo, and more than 1,200 others have been approved and are in the pipeline to be released. But prisons officials will not give out any demographic information.

Kathy Hawk Sawyer, a senior adviser at the Bureau of Prisons who formerly led the agency, said in an interview in late April that to “suggest that we are only identifying high profile white collar inmates for home confinement, is absurd.”

Manafort’s release was first reported by ABC News.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The House is expected to vote on the package as soon as Friday, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said there is no “urgency.” The Senate will wait until after Memorial Day to act.

The so-called Heroes Act is built around nearly $1 trillion for states, cities and tribal governments to avert layoffs, focused chiefly on $375 billion for smaller suburban and rural municipalities largely left out of earlier rounds of aid.

It will offer a fresh round of $1,200 direct cash aid to individuals, increased to up to $6,000 per household, and launches a $175 billion housing assistance fund to help pay rents and mortgages. There is $75 billion more for virus testing.

It would continue, through January, the $600-per-week boost to unemployment benefits. It adds a 15% increase for food stamps and new help for paying employer-backed health coverage. For businesses, there’s an employee retention tax credit.

There’s $200 billion in “hazard pay” for essential workers on the front lines of the crisis.

Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the bill “will be ready” to call lawmakers back to Washington for the vote.

But the 1,800-page package is heading straight into a Senate roadblock. Senate Republicans are not planning to vote on any new relief until June, after a Memorial Day recess.

President Donald Trump has already signed into law nearly $3 trillion in aid approved by Congress.

The new package extends some provisions from previous aid packages, and adds new ones.

There are other new resources, including $25 billion for the U.S. Postal Service. There is help for the 2020 Census and the November election. The bill also provides $3.6 billion to help local officials prepare for the challenges of holding elections during the pandemic.

The popular Payroll Protection Program, which has been boosted in past bills, would see another $10 billion to ensure under-served businesses and nonprofit organizations have access to grants through a disaster loan program.

For hospitals and other health care providers, there’s another $100 billion infusion to help cover costs and additional help for hospitals serving low-income communities.

There’s another $600 million in funding to tackle the issue of rapid spread of the virus in state and federal prisons, along with $600 million in help to local police departments for salaries and equipment

As states weigh the health risks of re-opening, McConnell said the nation needs to “regroup and find a more sustainable middle ground between total lockdown and total normalcy.”

The Republican leader on Tuesday called the emerging Democratic bill a “big laundry list of pet priorities.”

“To those who would suggest a pause, I would say the hunger doesn’t take a pause, the rent doesn’t take a pause,” Pelosi said late Monday on MSNBC. “We have a big need. It’s monumental.”

But Senate Republicans are in no rush to spend what could be trillions more on aid.

“I don’t think we have yet felt the urgency of acting immediately,” McConnell told reporters Monday at the Capitol.

McConnell said he has been in close contact with the White House, assessing the aid Congress has already approved in response to the virus outbreak and next steps.

Trump is expected to meet Tuesday with a group of Senate Republicans. “If we decide to go forward, we’ll go forward together,” McConnell said. His priority is to ensure any new package includes liability protections for health care providers and businesses that are reopening.

Senate Republicans are not expected to act on any further aid until after the Memorial Day recess, according to a senior Republican aide unauthorized to discuss the planning and granted anonymity.

The Senate is set to recess at the end of next week for a previously scheduled break, with senators scheduled to return June 1.

The Senate recently reopened its side of the Capitol while the House remains largely shuttered due the the health concerns.

Senators have been in session since last week, voting on Trump’s nominees for judicial and executive branch positions and other issues. The Senate majority, the 53-member Senate Republican conference, is meeting for its regular luncheons most days, spread out three to a table for social distance. Democrats are convening by phone. Many senators, but not all, are wearing masks.

At least a dozen Capitol police officers and other staff have tested positive for the virus, and at least one senator, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, is in isolation at home after exposure from a staff member who tested positive. Other lawmakers have cycled in and out of quarantine.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer warned that if Trump and congressional Republicans “slow walk” more aid they will be repeating President Herbert Hoover’s “tepid” response to the Great Depression.

Fauci is among the health experts testifying Tuesday to a Senate panel. His testimony comes as President Donald Trump is praising states that are reopening after the prolonged lockdown aimed at controlling the virus’s spread.

Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn, chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said as the hearing opened that “what our country has done so far in testing is impressive, but not nearly enough.”

Fauci, a member of the coronavirus task force charged with shaping the response to COVID-19, which has killed tens of thousands of people in the U.S., is testifying via video conference after self-quarantining as a White House staffer tested positive for the virus.

With the U.S. economy in free-fall and more than 30 million people unemployed, Trump has been pressuring states to reopen.

Fauci, in a statement to The New York Times, warned that officials should adhere to federal guidelines for a phased reopening, including a “downward trajectory” of positive tests or documented cases of coronavirus over two weeks, robust contact tracing and “sentinel surveillance” testing of asymptomatic people in vulnerable populations, such as nursing homes.

“If we skip over the checkpoints in the guidelines ... then we risk the danger of multiple outbreaks throughout the country,” Fauci wrote. “This will not only result in needless suffering and death, but would actually set us back on our quest to return to normal.”

A recent Associated Press review determined that 17 states did not meet a key White House benchmark for loosening restrictions — a 14-day downward trajectory in new cases or positive test rates. Yet many of those have begun to reopen or are about to do so, including Alabama, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Utah.

Of the 33 states that have had a 14-day downward trajectory of either cases or positive test rates, 25 are partially opened or moving to reopen within days, the AP analysis found. Other states that have not seen a 14-day decline, remain closed despite meeting some benchmarks.

Fauci put himself in quarantine after a White House staffer tested positive for the virus. Alexander also put himself in quarantine after an aide tested positive.

Besides Fauci, of the National Institutes of Health, the other experts include FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn and Dr. Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — both in self-quarantine—and Adm. Brett Giroir, the coronavirus “testing czar” at the Department of Health and Human Services.

The health committee hearing offers a very different setting from the White House coronavirus task force briefings the administration witnesses have all participated in. Most significantly, Trump will not be controlling the agenda.

Eyeing the November elections, Trump has been eager to restart the economy, urging on protesters who oppose their state governors’ stay-at-home orders and expressing his own confidence that the coronavrius will fade away as summer advances and Americans return to work and other pursuits.

The U.S. has seen at least 1.3 million infections and nearly 81,000 confirmed deaths from the virus, the highest toll in the world by far, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

Separately, one expert from the World Health Organization has already warned that some countries are “driving blind” into reopening their economies without having strong systems to track new outbreaks. And three countries that do have robust tracing systems — South Korea, Germany and China — have already seen new outbreaks after lockdown rules were relaxed.

WHO’s emergencies chief, Dr. Michael Ryan, said Germany and South Korea have good contact tracing that hopefully can detect and stop virus clusters before they get out of control. But he said other nations — which he did not name — have not effectively employed investigators to contact people who test positive, track down their contacts and get them into quarantine before they can spread the virus.

“Shutting your eyes and trying to drive through this blind is about as silly an equation as I’ve seen,” Ryan said. “Certain countries are setting themselves up for some seriously blind driving over the next few months.”

Apple, Google, some U.S. states and European countries are developing contact-tracing apps that show whether someone has crossed paths with an infected person. But experts say the technology only supplements and does not replace labor-intensive human work.

U.S. contact tracing remains a patchwork of approaches and readiness levels. States are hiring contact tracers but experts say tens of thousands will be needed across the country.

Worldwide, the virus has infected nearly 4.2 million people and killed over 286,000, including more than 150,000 in Europe, according to the Johns Hopkins tally. Experts believe those numbers are too low for a variety of reasons.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal say the program operates “with little to no transparency.”

Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who ran for president, tweeted on April 27: “Project Air Bridge is Jared Kushner’s secretive public-private partnership for COVID-19 supplies – but it’s failing. States can’t get equipment & nobody’s explaining how the project works. @SenBlumenthal & I want answers from the participating suppliers.”

That same day, Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, tweeted: “Trump seems to be playing politics again with public health — misdistributing scarce medical supplies. @SenWarren & I demand transparency on Project Air Bridge & how it works.”

Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and a White House senior adviser, is identified in a variety of news reports as the central player in launching Project Air Bridge in March. A key feature is using companies, including Medline, to distribute the medical supplies nationwide.

The senators are pressing Medline for a list of all supplies delivered via Project Air Bridge and all recipients, whether state or local governments, hospitals or medical systems or other clients.

Medline Industries CEO Charlie Mills was at the White House on March 29 for a meeting of coronavirus supply chain distributors with President Donald Trump. The firm is among the nation’s largest privately-held health care manufacturers and distributors.

The firm — once in the news for its ethylene oxide environmental issues at its Waukegan sterilization facility — is making masks, gloves and sanitizers in Lake County. The Waukegan facility is now reopened and with new emissions control equipment is sterilizing the high- grade N95 masks in short supply.

On April 27, Warren and Blumenthal sent a letter to Mills, asking about “your company’s interactions” with the White House Coronavirus Task Force, the Federal Emergency Management Agency “and other executive branch entities distributing medical supplies during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.”

The letter also stated that “the American people need an explanation for how these supplies are obtained, priced, and distributed through Project Air Bridge. Unfortunately, neither the administration nor your company has explained critical details, such as the content of any existing contracts or financial agreements.”

“Between reports of shortages across the country, seizures of supplies by the government, and outrageous prices, there is an extraordinary level of confusion and dismay about the current state of the medical supply chain.”

The senators told the executives the administration is “stonewalling” about Project Air Bridge and requested supply chain information the companies are in a position to know.

The senators wanted replies by Friday. Medline spokesman Jesse Greenberg told the Chicago Sun-Times on Friday, “I decline to respond at this time.”

Similar letters were sent to executives of five other Project Air Bridge companies: Cardinal Health; Concordance Healthcare Solutions; Henry Schein; McKesson; and Owens and Minor.

As of May 4, Project Air Bridge completed 112 international flights, with another 23 ready to go, according to the Department of Homeland Security. O’Hare Airport is among the destinations.

No shipments included goods intended for distribution by the state of Illinois. “We have not received anything directly from Project Air Bridge,” Jordan Abudayyeh, a spokesman for Gov. J.B. Pritzker, told the Sun-Times.

Pritzker has been in the spotlight for airlifting urgently needed supplies from overseas suppliers in cloak-and-dagger operations to avoid having items headed for the state end up sidetracked to federal supply chains.

The Trump White House frequently brags about the amount of desperately needed medical supplies from Asia that are flown into the U.S. instead of coming by ship, which is slower.

Warren and Blumenthal are concerned about how the goods are distributed, the financial relationships with the companies involved and the potential for profiteering.

The federal government pays for the supplies — masks, face shields, gowns, gloves — as well as the air freight.

According to FEMA, Medline and the other Project Air Bridge companies are required to make a priority of selling 50% of the supplies to clients in “hot spots” with the firms free to sell the rest through their “traditional channels.”

The Elmhurst resident, a middle school science teacher, was a Trump delegate from Illinois.

Almost four years later, with the COVID-19 pandemic bringing an unprecedented health crisis and economic meltdown to the U.S., Fratella told me he won’t be voting for Trump in 2020.

What can persuade a change of mind for a Trump supporter? For the science teacher, it was Trump’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak.

“I’ve never voted Democrat for president. I don’t know if I would vote for [Joe] Biden or I would just sit it out. But I just can’t square that it’s worth it to vote for him [Trump],” Fratella said.

In 2016, Trump made sense to Fratella, an anybody-but-Hillary man. That Trump was not a “traditional Republican” was fine with Fratella, even though his roots were more with the regulars, not the Trump rebels. Fratella’s first deep dive into politics was volunteering for Bob Dole’s 1996 GOP presidential campaign, when Dole ran against Bill Clinton.

Fratella, 42, liked Trump’s “plain straightforward talk” at the time. “I think to me the alternative was having another Clinton in the White House, and moving further and further to the left, which I thought would happen if Hillary won. So I think that was the main attraction,” he said.

When schools closed and stay-at-home orders were imposed in March, Fratella started watching Trump’s daily Coronavirus Task Force briefings, which quickly became a Trump produced TV show starring Trump.

Fratella, in part, wanted to see what Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Deborah Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator, were saying.

“The other part of me was interested just to see what [Trump] would do and what kind of ridiculous statements he would make, you know, or who he would get into it with in the press corps or what kind of silliness he would get involved in,” Fratella said.

I asked Fratella when he realized Trump was going too far.

“I think it was kind of a slow build that each day there was something new where he was saying something incredible, or contradicting his experts.

“I remember him saying in the fall it will be gone. And then Dr. Fauci comes out and says ‘This isn’t going away’ five minutes later,” he said.

“…I don’t know if there’s one point specifically or if it was just kind of a snowball, snowballing effect. But it is frustrating as, you know, to see him just, you know say things that are scientifically untrue.”

A blatant example was Trump’s promotion of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 cure.

“It was mind blowing that he would suggest a drug that he knew nothing about or that he had just heard secondhand that well, maybe this works and then the other day with the sunlight, the disinfectant, those kinds of things blew my mind, …..He’s telling people to inject or to put UV light in your body,” Fratella said.

What is it Trump’s base hears when he predicts the COVID-19 outbreak threat will soon diminish? I asked Fratella to translate.

“They hear the president, the leader of the country say, ‘It’ll be gone’ and they think that he may know something that they don’t,” he said.

You hear Trump talk a lot about his “base.” There is an important difference between the “base” and Trump backers, or in Fratella’s case, ex-supporters. He explains it for me.

“I think the difference between the base and a supporter is that the base will support him no matter what. Come hell or high water....Supporters are a little more analytical and their opinions are less fixed than the base,” Fratella said.

Many in the base, are not as willing, Fratella said, to “see the other side of an argument.”

“I don’t think I was ever part of his base. I was always a supporter, but I could see faults. The fault with the handling of coronavirus was just too much to reason through. It was more than just a policy. It was something that had immediate real-life consequences,” he said.

“I think some of those real-life consequences are being seen in the protests. People being defiant because they read him saying they need to ‘liberate’ their states.”

But for those who don’t know, it means “deceased.” As in dead.

So you can imagine Janet Williams’ surprise last week when she received a $1,200 federal stimulus check in the mail made out to her late stepfather, “Arthur Keyser DECD.”

Opinion

Keyser died in November 2018, which the government apparently knew, Williams notes, BECAUSE IT SAYS SO RIGHT ON THE FACE OF THE $1,200 CHECK THEY SENT HIM.

It’s already been widely reported that the Treasury Department mistakenly sent out thousands of stimulus payments to dead people in its rush to get money out the door and revive the economy.

The explanation is there wasn’t time to cross reference the list of check recipients with the Social Security Administration’s death index, which is understandable to a point.

But couldn’t some computer whiz have fashioned a fairly simple program to weed out the people with “DECD” behind their names?

Keyser was hardly the only “DECD” person to get such a check with that fairly obvious clue printed right on the face. There have been similar anecdotal reports from other news outlets around the country, as well as from the mother-in-law of one of my bosses at the paper, which cinches it.

The question is what to do with such a check once it has been received.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the Wall Street Journal that dead people aren’t eligible to collect the $1,200 and that their relatives and estates should repay the money to the government. Presumably, if they didn’t receive the money by direct deposit, they should just send back the check.

But others are questioning Mnuchin’s authority to make that determination, arguing the law passed by Congress makes no provision for the federal government to claw back stimulus funds sent in error.

The IRS issued detailed instructions Wednesday on how to return stimulus checks by mail or pay them back if they’ve already been deposited.

Williams, who lives in Roscoe Village and works for a medical trade association, said she does not plan to return the check, but neither does she intend to cash it.

“It’s more trouble for me than it’s worth to send it back,” she said, noting there’s no harm to the U.S. Treasury as long as the check isn’t cashed.

Plus, she said, “It’s a nice souvenir.”

Williams said the check came to her home address because she has power of attorney for Keyser’s estate and filed a tax return on its behalf for 2018, which is what triggered the stimulus payment.

Williams sees the check as emblematic of the incompetence of the Trump Administration on full display during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“They don’t understand public health. They don’t understand managing a public health crisis. They don’t understand national security and working with others around the world on solutions,” she said. “This is just another example of their ineptitude.”

Although I share her dim view of the president, it must be pointed out in all fairness that there were similar problems when the Obama Administration rushed out stimulus payments during the Great Recession in 2009.

The Social Security Administration inspector general reported a year later that the government had sent $18 million in stimulus checks to 72,000 dead people.

So maybe this just falls under the general heading of nonpartisan bureaucratic incompetence in Washington.

It would seem likely that with so many people hurting financially right now that many of them are going to cash their dead relatives’ checks and worry about the consequences later.

Count Williams among those who are doubtful the government will ever see that money in its coffers again, despite President Donald Trump’s assurance during a briefing last week that: “We’ll get that back.”

“If they didn’t cross reference those names to begin with, how do we believe they’re going to eventually catch up with the people who cash them,” she said.

As for the check to her stepfather, she thinks about all the other people who could benefit from that money right now.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The justices were hearing their third day of arguments conducted by telephone because of the coronavirus pandemic. The first of two cases before them Wednesday stemmed from the Obama-era health law, under which most employers must cover birth control as a preventive service, at no charge to women, in their insurance plans.

In 2017, the Trump administration announced it would broaden an exemption to the contraceptive coverage requirement that previously applied to houses of worship, such as churches, synagogues and mosques. But the change was blocked by courts.

The Supreme Court’s four liberal justices suggested they were troubled by the changes, which the government has estimated would cause about 70,000 women, and at most 126,000 women, to lose contraception coverage in one year.

Chief Justice John Roberts, a key vote on a court split between conservatives and liberals, suggested that the Trump administration’s reliance on a federal religious freedom law to expand the exemption was “too broad.”

And Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who joined the conversation from a Maryland hospital where she was being treated for an infection caused by a gallstone, gave the government’s top Supreme Court lawyer, Solicitor General Noel Franciso, what sounded like a lecture.

“You have just tossed entirely to the wind what Congress thought was essential, that is that women be provided these .... services with no hassle, no cost to them,” said Ginsburg, who is expected to be in the hospital for a day or two.

The court’s conservative justices seemed more willing to side with the administration, with Trump appointee Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggesting the administration’s changes might be considered “within the bounds of reasonable.”

Beyond exempting churches, synagogues and mosques from the contraceptive coverage requirement, the Obama administration also created a way by which religiously affiliated organizations including hospitals, universities and charities could opt out of paying for contraception, but women on their health plans would still get no-cost birth control. Some groups complained the opt-out process itself violated their religious beliefs.

That opt-out process was the subject of a previous Supreme Court case, but the court, with only eight justices at the time because of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, didn’t decide the issue. It instead sent both sides back to see if they could work out a compromise.

That didn’t happen. “Is it really the case that there is no way to resolve those differences?” Roberts asked at one point.

After the Trump administration took over, officials announced a rule change that allows many companies and organization with religious or moral objections to opt out of covering birth control without providing an alternate avenue for coverage.

New Jersey and Pennsylvania challenged the rules in court, and a judge blocked them from going into effect. The judge found the Trump administration did not follow proper procedures for issuing the rules. An appeals court agreed, and the administration appealed to the Supreme Court to step in, as did the Little Sisters of the Poor. The order of Roman Catholic nuns had been instrumental in challenging the Obama administration rules.

But on Wednesday, Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned why the Little Sisters of the Poor were even at the court because for a number of reasons they don’t have to provide contraceptive coverage. Sotomayor also referenced the coronavirus pandemic during her questioning, asking attorney Paul Clement, who was representing the nuns, whether an employer might be able to object to paying for a coronavirus vaccine. He said “no.”

Even though the Trump rules remain blocked, a ruling by a federal judge in Texas in June already allows most people who object to covering contraception to avoid doing so.

In the second case the justices heard Wednesday, political consultants and pollsters were among those asking the Supreme Court to strike down a federal law from 1991 that bars them from making robocalls to cellphones. The case only arose after Congress in 2015 created an exception in the law that allows the automated calls for collection of government debt.

The court wrestled with whether it could get rid of just the government-debt restriction or would have to invalidate the entire ban on cellphone robocalls. “No one wants robocalls on their cellphone,” Roberts said, though he typically votes for the challengers in free-speech cases.

The argument provided a light moment of the day when Justice Stephen Breyer got cut off when someone tried calling him. Breyer said after he rejoined the court’s arguments: “The telephone started to ring, and it cut me off the call and I don’t think it was a robocall.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Brian Miller, a lawyer in the White House counsel’s office, goes before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday for his nomination as special inspector general for pandemic recovery. The post would place him in charge of overseeing a roughly $500 billion Treasury fund for industry created as part of the economic rescue law approved in late March.

In prepared testimony, Miller pledged to be vigilant in protecting the integrity and independence of his office and vowed “to seek the truth in all matters that come before me and to use my authority and resources to uncover fraud, waste and abuse.’’

Miller has worked at the Justice Department and was inspector general for nearly a decade at the General Services Administration, which oversees thousands of federal contracts. While he is respected in the oversight community, Miller’s role in the White House counsel’s office — which led Trump’s defense during impeachment — is troubling, Democrats and watchdog groups said.

Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, top Democrat on the banking panel, said he questions whether Miller will be able to hold the Trump administration accountable for how it administers the business program and “guarantee that corporations getting taxpayer money put their workers first.″

“Mr. Miller will be called upon to answer how he will ensure he is independent and will hold the administration accountable,’’ Brown said in a statement.

Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said Miller’s nomination is part of a pattern of “roadblocks thrown up” by Trump to block oversight of his administration.

In recent weeks, Trump has fired an inspector general tied to his impeachment and sidelined another who was set to lead a group of inspectors general overseeing the rescue package. On Friday night, Trump moved to replace yet another inspector general, an acting official who criticized the coronavirus response by federal health officials.

Trump also said in signing the rescue law that he will resist oversight provisions.

“All of this taken together means real oversight will be met with retribution, which makes it all the more important,’’ Bookbinder said.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

With social distancing guidelines possibly curtailing in-person voting at the polls in November, states are drawing up plans to rely more heavily on a mail-in system that has until now seen only limited use.

Get the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.

Historically, there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud through mail-in voting. But social media users are already pushing grandiose theories casting doubt on the method. President Donald Trump has encouraged the skepticism, saying during a televised briefing that “a lot of people cheat with mail-in voting.” On Saturday, he tweeted: “Don’t allow RIGGED ELECTIONS!”

Justice Department officials are concerned foreign adversaries could exploit any vulnerabilities in the vote-by-mail process, especially since even minor tampering could trigger widespread doubts about the integrity of the vote.

“Is it possible, in particular for a foreign actor, to cause enough mischief in the vote-by-mail process to raise a question in the minds of Americans, particularly Americans perhaps whose candidate has lost, that somehow the result of this election is unfair?” Assistant Attorney General John Demers, the department’s top national security official, said in describing a key question confronting law enforcement.

Several disinformation experts said they have not found evidence yet that foreign actors are covertly pushing a false narrative about mail-in voting.

But a sham social media campaign that feeds existing doubts about the U.S. election process would align with the Kremlin’s playbook, said Bret Schafer, a media and digital disinformation fellow at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a Washington think tank. During the 2016 election, Russia-linked groups polluted American voters’ social media feeds with messages about hot-button topics like race relations, gun laws and immigration.

“You don’t have to hack the vote to hack people’s perception of the vulnerability of the vote,” he said. “All you need to do is to seed enough doubt about the legitimacy of a vote.”

Well before the coronavirus upended America’s electoral process, federal officials were girding for the prospect of foreign interference in the U.S. election. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security warned in February that Russia could seek to misuse voter registration data and even secretly advise campaigns or candidates, according to documents The Associated Press obtained.

Now, a potential overhaul of how millions of Americans vote could present new vulnerabilities for foreign adversaries to weaponize.

Only five states currently conduct mail-in voting, where a ballot is automatically mailed to every eligible voter.

The remaining states have substantial work in the months ahead. They will have to make major changes to their voting and tabulating systems, buy equipment or software to track the ballots and sort out who — individual voters or taxpayers — will pay for return postage in less than six months’ time to accommodate more voting by mail.

Some states are exploring how to simply expand existing absentee voting systems, in which voters can request a ballot.

“Just like you wouldn’t want to premiere your play straight to Broadway, it’s hard to have a very new or very changed system in a high-stakes presidential election, especially under conditions where normal meetings, trainings, might be impacted by the pandemic,” said Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine.

Those last-minute changes could spur unsubstantiated claims about rampant voter fraud, an unsupported theory that Trump and some of his supporters have already pushed for years.

Russian state media have already questioned states’ attempts to postpone primaries or transition them to a mail-in process as governors grapple with how to hold an election against the backdrop of the virus.

“Coronavirus is coming, hide the ballots! Calls to cancel campaigns & voting erode already-thin trust in US primaries,” read a headline on the website of the Russian television channel RT, which broadcasts in English and is aimed at audiences outside Russia.

Meanwhile, conspiracy theories that Democrats are hyping the pandemic to push for mail-in voting or that forecasts of a second wave this fall are part of a ploy to cancel an in-person vote have received thousands of likes, retweets and shares on Facebook, Twitter and Reddit. The theories are popular in dozens of Facebook groups that have been created in recent weeks to protest governors’ stay-at-home orders.

“When you have this ambiguity and uncertainty, that’s fertile ground for pushing out false information,” said Schafer, the think tank fellow. “This is creating a perfect environment for these narratives to thrive.”

Negative chatter around mail-in ballots spiked in those Facebook groups after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi proposed expanding early voting and mail-in voting last month, said Madelyn Webb, a research reporter for First Draft, an organization that tracks disinformation.

One popular meme accused Democrats of extending the quarantine to push “mail in ballots so they can cheat.” The image received a combined 90,000 likes, comments and shares, mostly on pro-Trump and conservative Facebook pages.

And for under $100, the Alaska Republican Party took out a Facebook ad that said: “Democrats are using the coronavirus pandemic to gut election fraud protections. Don’t let them. Add your name to our petition to STOP BALLOT HARVESTING!” Facebook said the ad, which is still running, does not violate its policies.

Meanwhile, liberal social media users are pushing mail-in voting as a surefire option, glossing over some of the challenges such drastic changes to the voting system will present.

Facebook groups like Occupy Democrats and Being Liberal widely circulated an article promoting vote by mail, saying it has a history of success because the U.S. military has used the method for decades.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

J.B. Pritzker said at his Sunday briefing. “We don’t have enough swabs.”

Earlier on Sunday, Pritzker said in an interview on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” “Recently we got a call from the White House telling us that in May they’re sending us 600,000 swabs, and I’m very grateful for that.”

What is a swab?

It’s an item as light as a feather but in short supply as the demand for COVID-19 testing grows. Mass testing is key to trying to reopen our lives, schools and economy.

The federal Food and Drug Administration in recent weeks has expanded swab testing options and materials, fast tracking decision making in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

Swabs are essential to collecting samples from a nose or throat. Swabs are put in a package with a reagent — it could be some kind of a liquid — to preserve the sample. The sample is sent to a lab with a testing machine to see if it is positive for COVID-19.

No swab, no test.

Merriam Webster defines a swab as “a wad of absorbent material usually wound around one end of a small stick and used especially for applying medication or for removing material from an area.”

That definition doesn’t go far enough.

Medical swabs for COVID-19 testing, it turns out, are quite bespoke tools. Here are seven things to know about swabs in the era of the novel coronavirus:

• Q-tip, the best known swab brand used every day for a variety of purposes, is made of 100% pure cotton and is bonded to a short paper stick. It is not approved by the FDA for COVID-19 testing.

According to STAT, the health and medical publication, a Q-tip does not work for testing “in part due to the fact that the cotton on the tip contains its own DNA; cotton, after all, is a plant.” That DNA could be confused with the DNA from the testing sample and trigger a false result.

The swabs being used currently are nylon or foam, STAT reported.

• Most COVID-19 testing swabs used in the U.S. are made mainly by two companies: Puritan Medical Products in Maine and a company in Italy, a coronavirus outbreak epicenter.

• Not all medical swabs are the same. There are COVID-19 testing swabs for use by health professionals and swabs for self-collection that are just emerging on the market.

Tests used by the pros involve swabs on long sticks that can reach deep into a throat or nasal cavity, an uncomfortable procedure. That means the person collecting the specimen has to use PPE — personal protective equipment, also in short supply. Self collection means less need for PPE.

• On April 16, there was a breakthrough. The FDA allowed fully synthetic swabs to be made with polyester tips to be used on shorter sticks. These Q-tip size polyester swabs can be used for front of the nose testing and sent to the lab preserved in a saline solution.

Front of the nose testing is “notable,” the FDA said, “because it allows self-collection for patients, thereby limiting exposure of health care providers; it is more comfortable for patients, and it can be performed by a swab that is more readily available and manufacturable at scale.”

• With the FDA approval, U.S. Cotton, based in Cleveland, was able to launch the large-scale manufacture of polyester swabs.

• While cotton has not been used on COVID-19 swabs, on April 21, the FDA, using emergency authorization, gave permission to the Laboratory Corporation of America, known as LabCorp, to use a specially made Q-tip style cotton swab it developed for home collection kits.

Addressing the exception allowing the use of cotton, an FDA spokeswoman said, “These swabs have been evaluated to see if they caused false negatives/positives or if they impacted the controls [which they do not].”

During the pandemic, the FDA said it has been working with more than 380 test developers.

• On April 29, the Department of Defense announced it was awarding a $75.5 million contract to Puritan Medical Products using the Defense Production Act. A Pentagon spokesman said that will “quickly” double its capacity to 40 million swabs a month, with production to begin in May.

Pritzker said last week on NBC’s “Today” show that the White House was “promising to deliver to us for the month of May about 20,000 swabs per day, which is very important.” The state is also procuring swabs through its own sources, with no number available of what’s on hand.

Pritzker’s aim is to have enough swabs for 18,000 tests per day, with the average now at about 15,000, spokesman Jordan Abudayyeh said.

“We need as many swabs as we can get our hands on,” she said.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Get the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.

“From our perspective, this remains speculative,” Dr. Michael Ryan told reporters in Geneva. “We have not received any data or specific evidence from the U.S. government relating to the purported origin of the virus.”

He said WHO would be “very willing” to receive any such information the U.S. has.

The comments come as the Trump administration has denounced both China and the U.N. health agency for alleged missteps in handling the outbreak that first emerged in the city of Wuhan and has now infected millions and killed at least 239,000 people. Trump on Friday said WHO was “like the public relations agency for China.”

Ryan reiterated that the evidence and advice that the U.N. health agency has received suggest that the novel coronavirus is of natural origin, even if Pompeo and Trump have alleged evidence they have seen suggests it could be from the Wuhan Institute of Virology lab.

“If that data and evidence is available, then it will be for the United States government to decide whether and when it can be shared,” Ryan said. “But it’s difficult for WHO to operate in an information vacuum in that specific regard.”

On Sunday, Pompeo told ABC’s “This Week” program that there was “a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.”

Ryan and Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical lead on the WHO emergencies program, put their focus on the hunt for the animal host that is believed to have relayed the coronavirus from bats. Such a determination could help drive public health policies, like advising people to keep away from some types of wildlife or livestock.

They said Chinese scientists continued to work with the world against the pandemic, and suggested such collaboration remained crucial — and that efforts to “investigate” possible wrongdoing by Chinese officials could derail such scientific cooperation.

“We need to understand that we can learn from Chinese scientists, we can learn from each other, we can exchange knowledge and we can find the answers together,” Ryan said. “If this is projected as aggressive investigation of wrongdoing, then I believe that’s much more difficult to deal with. That’s a political issue. That is not a science issue.”

“Science will find the answers,” he added. “The implications of those answers can be dealt with from a policy and political perspective.”

WHO heaped praise on China from early on in the outbreak.

On Jan. 30, moments before announcing that the coronavirus was a global health emergency, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said China was “setting a new standard for outbreak response.” He praised the speed with which China detected the outbreak, sequenced the genome and shared that information with WHO. He said its ”commitment to transparency” was “beyond words.”

The joint team said at the time that it was not probing any allegations that China may have mishandled the outbreak.

The changes are a result of the coronavirus pandemic, which has made holding courtroom sessions unsafe, especially with six justices aged 65 or older and at risk of getting seriously sick from the virus.

The historic session began at the usual time of 10 a.m. EDT, when Marshal Pamela Talkin called the court to order and Chief Justice John Roberts announced the day’s case.

“Oyez! Oyez! Oyez!” Talkin began, dropping the words commanding people “to draw near” to reflect the unusual circumstances.

Arguments, scheduled to last an hour as they would generally in the courtroom, ran 17 minutes long, but without serious problems. The justices asked roughly two questions apiece at a time, and Roberts occasionally interjected to keep things moving.

And there was one mild surprise: Justice Clarence Thomas asked questions for the first time in more than a year.

Several justices said “good morning” to the lawyers, a telephone nicety not often heard in the courtroom. The justices also did not interrupt each other, as they frequently do in court, and instead took turns asking questions.

The court’s plaza, normally bustling on the mornings of arguments, was deserted Monday, as it has been since the building was closed to the public in mid-March because of the virus outbreak. Two months of arguments were postponed before the court decided to hear 10 cases over six days in May.

The experiment could propel the court to routinely livestream its arguments. Or it could just be an extraordinary exception to the court’s sustained opposition to broadening the audience that can hear, if not see, its work live.

Cases that will be heard over the next two weeks include President Donald Trump’s effort to shield tax and other financial records and whether presidential electors have to cast their Electoral College ballots for the candidate who wins the popular vote in their state.

The court chose a somewhat obscure case about whether the travel website Booking.com can trademark its name for its first foray into remote arguments. The lawyers on both sides are well known to the justices and experienced in arguing before the nation’s highest court.

Justice Department lawyer Erica Ross, who once served as a law clerk to Justice Elena Kagan, was first up. She last argued at the court in late February. She delivered this Supreme Court argument, her sixth, from a Justice Department conference room.

She was followed by Lisa Blatt, a onetime government lawyer who will be arguing her 40th Supreme Court case. Blatt will be at her Washington-area home, she told The Washington Post.

She is known for her colorful writing and speaking style and for her ability to engage in a healthy give and take with the justices. She was also a prominent liberal supporter of Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his contentious Senate confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court.

Blatt, representing Booking.com, got Justice Sonia Sotomayor to laugh out loud when she told the justice, “It looks like we would have lost if you were the trial judge.”

Each lawyer got two uninterrupted minutes to make an opening statement, after which Roberts kicked off the questioning. After that, the justices asked questions in order of seniority. Kavanaugh, who joined the court in 2018, went last.

The court sometimes issues opinions at the start of argument sessions, with the justice who wrote for the majority reading a summary of the opinion and, more rarely, a second justice summarizing a dissent. But in another change wrought by the virus outbreak, opinions are being posted online without any statements from justices. The court will next issue opinions on Thursday.

The session ended as it always does in the courtroom. Roberts said, “The case is submitted.”

Talkin followed: “The honorable court is now adjourned until tomorrow at 10 o’clock.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Among the Chicago-area companies to benefit, records show, were:

A railcar manufacturer — which secured the maximum $10 million — that closed a factory in Virginia last year and opened a new one in Mexico while paying its CEO $2.1 million in total compensation.

A clean-energy company in Cicero that told shareholders when it announced its $9.5 million loan that COVID-19 hadn’t harmed its business.

Two companies that employ thousands of workers — well over the program’s usual 500-employee limit, though businesses also can qualify based on net worth or net income.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said this past week that the rules that had allowed publicly traded corporations and other big companies to quickly deplete the initial $349 billion pot — shutting out many mom-and-pop operations — needed tightening. He warned publicly held companies that got more than $2 million through the coronavirus stimulus program that they would be audited. And he has asked large enterprises to voluntarily give back the money or possiblly face criminal charges if found to have cheated.

The U.S. Small Business Administration, which is overseeing the program, requires that “borrowers still must certify in good faith that their PPP loan request is necessary,” taking into account access to cash and credit. “For example, it is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith,” the Trump administration said April 23.

The SBA won’t disclose who got the bailout money. But some large national franchises have said they’ll give back the money they got after reports disclosed that. Among them: Potbelly, the Chicago-based sandwich giant.

The loans were part of a $2 trillion coronavirus-relief package Congress passed in March. In part, they were to cover fixed costs like rent and utilities, but the bulk of the money for companies under 500 workers was to keep people on the payroll. Another $321 billion has since been added to the program.

Illinois businesses, including the parent company of the Chicago Sun-Times, secured about 69,000 loans through April 16 totaling $15.9 billion, according to SBA data.

Eight publicly traded companies in Illinois have disclosed their participation. Altogether, they‘ve collected more than $38 million in the low-interest loans:

FreightCar International, a Chicago manufacturer of rail cars, received the maximum $10 million on April 16. The president of the company, which has 496 employees, was in line in 2019 for $2.1 million in total compensation, including a $750,000 bonus, according to its filings with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission.

That same year, as it reported $229.9 million in revenue and a net loss of $75.2 million, the company closed a plant in Virginia, then leased a manufacturing facility in Mexico that’s set to open later this year. FreightCar also eliminated medical and vision insurance for retirees and their dependents as of Jan 1, telling shareholders that saved $6.6 million.

Company representatives didn’t respond to messages seeking comment.

Broadwind Energy, a Cicero manufacturer of clean-energy equipment, received $9.5 million even as it reported earlier in April that it had $12.5 million in available credit and nearly as much in cash.

“We did not experience significant impacts from the novel coronavirus disease in the first quarter of 2020, in part, because our facilities currently operate as essential businesses,” the publicly traded company, which has 521 employees, reported in securities filings April 13.

Jason Bonfigt, Broadwind Energy’s vice president, said Friday that changed in recent weeks.

“Without the support of the PPP loan, there was a strong likelihood that we would have had to consider targeted cost reductions, including a reduction-in-force of valued staff,” Bonfigt said. “Broadwind met all of the requirements set forth by the U.S. treasury to apply for the PPP loan and did so in good faith, ensuring continued employment for our workers during a period of widespread economic uncertainty.”

The SBA permits some businesses, such as restaurants, to treat each location as a separate entity. That allowed the Gibsons steakhouse chain in Chicago to get a loan.

“We applied for it and were fortunate to get some relief,” Gibsons chairman Stephen Lombardo III says, though he would not disclose how much money the company got.

Lombardo says that about 1,800 of Gibsons’ 2,000 workers have gone back to work at its 10 restaurants, which are offering takeout meals during the shutdown.

SigmaTron International Inc. of Elk Grove Village, which has more than 3,106 employees worldwide, got $6.3 million on April 23, according to its federal filings.

Unknown: how many of those employees work at the company’s factories in Mexico, Vietnam and China.

The problem is that no one can say for sure what the test results mean.

Despite a proliferation of COVID-19 antibody tests that are now available, having been churned out hastily under emergency conditions, the science that will help explain whether the antibodies offer future immunity isn’t there yet.

And a recent examination by some of the nation’s top scientists found unacceptably high rates of false positives in some antibody tests, calling into question their usefulness.

As more states inch toward reopening their economies, experts caution that antibody tests are just one tool and an imperfect one at that.

“It’s very early. We need to do so much more work,” says Dr. Mary K. Hayden, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Rush University Medical College and spokeswoman for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

Antibody tests are different from the molecular nasal swab tests used to detect the presence of live coronavirus in an infected person.

The antibody test takes a small amount of blood to look for the presence of antibodies produced by the body’s immune system in response to an infection. With COVID-19, antibodies usually appear a week or more after the onset of symptoms.

Much hope has been placed on antibody tests, on the theory that knowing whether people have been infected in the past might show whether they have enough immunity to safely return to work or school. The results also potentially could show who is qualified to donate blood for convalescent plasma, which is being used investigationally on very ill patients.

There are several concerns, though. The first is accuracy. The majority of antibody tests were manufactured without approval from the federal Food and Drug Administration, which offered “regulatory flexibility” for test developers due to the pandemic.

While swab tests used to diagnose live virus must have an “Emergency Use Authorization” from the FDA, only a handful of antibody tests have made it through that process.

U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Illinois, who chairs a House panel investigating whether the antibody tests work as advertised, has urged the FDA to better police the test-kit manufacturers and pull faulty tests from the market.

The FDA has said the National Institutes of Health will evaluate the tests.

The COVID-19 Testing Project — a joint effort of the University of California-San Francisco, University of California-Berkeley, the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub and the Innovative Genomics Institute — tested 14 coronavirus antibody tests and found that only one delivered no false-positive results, meaning it never detected antibodies in someone who was never infected.

Two others came close, delivering no false positives nearly 99% of the time.

The 11 other tests did not fare as well. Four had false-positive rates ranging from 11% to 16%, and many of the others were around 5%.

Even the three highly accurate tests gave false-negatives about 10% of the time, which means some people who had been exposed to the virus weren’t flagged by the tests.

Poor quality tests could have huge implications if large numbers of people were told they had survived an infection of COVID-19 when they actually had never been exposed to the virus.

Getting a false positive reading 10% of the time or more “definitely I would consider unacceptable,” says Patrick Hsu, a bioengineering professor at UC-Berkeley who is helping lead the COVID-19 Testing Project.

Hsu says he was intrigued by the tests, with at least 150 now available and consumers eager to be tested. “Yet these had not been rigorously or systematically evaluated,” he says.

Even if an antibody test is accurate, no one knows what a positive result means beyond confirming past exposure to the virus. Whether it might give you immunity in the same way that, say, having had chicken pox against getting that disease again does hasn’t been shown.

Experts at Johns Hopkins University caution that “antibody levels have not been correlated with immunity” and that, “while people who have been infected are presumed to have some immunity, it is unclear how much and for how long.”

The World Health Organization says, “There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.”

Scientists also are trying to figure out whether people who’ve had a really bad illness with COVID-19 produce more antibodies than those who’ve had only mild symptoms or were asymptomatic.

The notion that a positive antibody test gives someone an “immunity passport” to resume normal life is dangerous, according to Hsu, who says, “There are a lot of unknowns here.”

For now, antibody tests are more useful in giving a wide-lens look at where the virus already has swept through and where it has yet to arrive, Hayden says.

A large-scale testing program could be used to compare geographic communities or population groups with each other, providing they were “apples-to-apples” comparisons, Hayden says.

More testing also could help pin down more accurate death rates.

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the NIH have announced plans for testing.

Accuracy is important because, in communities where the coronavirus hasn’t heavily penetrated, false positives would make up a greater proportion of all the positive results and might even outnumber the true positives.

The bottom line: Antibody tests aren’t a get-out-of-jail-free card for antsy people hoping to get back to their old lives.

But it’s not all doom and gloom, Hayden says.

Besides working to understand how the coronavirus antibodies function and refining the tests, scientists are developing tests that could detect viral antigens, which would be another way to catch infectious patients at an early stage. They’re also working on a vaccine and testing drugs.

“Four months ago, we didn’t even know this virus existed,” Hayden says, noting the fast progress scientists have made. “But we have a lot to do and a lot to learn.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the clearinghouse for the web of U.S. spy agencies, comes as President Donald Trump and his allies have touted the as-yet-unproven theory that an infectious disease lab in Wuhan, the epicenter of the Chinese outbreak, was the source of the global pandemic, which has killed more than 220,000 people worldwide.

Get the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.

In recent days the Trump administration has sharpened its rhetoric on China, accusing the geopolitical foe and vital trading partner of failing to act swiftly enough to sound the alarm to the world about the outbreak or to stop the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.

The new statement says, “The Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified.”

“The IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.”

Trump addressed the theory earlier this month, saying, “More and more, we’re hearing the story.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo added, “The mere fact that we don’t know the answers — that China hasn’t shared the answers — I think is very, very telling.”

Pompeo also pressed China to let outside experts into the lab “so that we can determine precisely where this virus began.”

While Trump and Pompeo have made public statements speculating about the lab, a U.S. intelligence official disputed the notion that there was any pressure on agencies to bolster a particular theory. The intelligence official was not authorized to publicly discuss the issue and spoke only on condition of anonymity.

Scientists say the virus arose naturally in bats. Even so, Pompeo and others have pointed fingers at an institute that is run by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It has done groundbreaking research tracing the likely origins of the SARS virus, finding new bat viruses and discovering how they could jump to people.

“We know that there is the Wuhan Institute of Virology just a handful of miles away from where the wet market was,” Pompeo said two weeks ago. The institute has an address 8 miles, or 13 kilometers, from the market that is considered a possible source.

U.S. officials say the American Embassy in Beijing flagged concerns about potential safety issues at the lab in Wuhan in 2018, but they have yet to find any evidence the virus originated there nearly two years later.

The Chinese government said Thursday that any claims that the coronavirus was released from a laboratory are “unfounded and purely fabricated out of nothing.”

Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang cited the institute’s director, Yuan Zhiming, as saying the lab strictly implements bio-security procedures that would prevent the release of any pathogen.

“I would like to point out again that the origin of the virus is a complex scientific issue, and it should be studied by scientists and professionals,” Geng said.

Geng also criticized U.S. politicians who have suggested China should be held accountable for the global pandemic, saying they should spend their time on “better controlling the epidemic situation at home.”

But a Chinese government spokesman, Zhao Lijian, demonstrated that China was not above sowing confusion in the face of the pandemic. He tweeted in March the falsehood that the virus might have come from the U.S. Army.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The NBA and NHL will reawaken in time to play out their postseasons. Baseball will come — perhaps in early July — to big-league ballparks from coast to coast. The NFL will stay on schedule — or close to it — for its season.

And away we’ll go.

Again, that’s if all goes well. From this page to God’s ears, right?

Even in the best-case scenario, though, we’ll have to get used to seeing major pro sports played in largely empty arenas and stadiums. How will that look? Sound? Feel?

Does one of these sports stand to lose more than the others, in terms of the TV viewing experience, if no fans are in the seats? That’s question No. 1 in “Polling Place,” your weekly home for Sun-Times sports polls on Twitter.

“I think you feel the energy and the players’ [tendency] to be affected by it more in the NBA,” @riczaj01 commented. “Some NFL stadiums are like that also, but not on average.”

“With so much downtime, I would think MLB scans the crowd more than any other sport,” @StevesFitz noted.

The most votes, however, went to football. In the NFL, according to @nativehoosier, the “fans are like extras in an entertainment show, like [with] movie crowd shots.”

Aren’t crowd shots standard fare in pretty much all sports flicks? There’s always a love interest nervously hoping for the best, a yahoo dad yelling angrily about his kid’s playing time and a moment or three when the masses leap to their feet in unrestrained applause.

What the heck were we talking about again?

The truth is, we might not know unless — and until — we’ve seen ’em all fan-free. By the way, will any of these networks use recorded crowd music? Or mike up the benches, dugouts and sidelines?

Upshot: “Same” received by far the most votes, but “less” beating “more” by a 3½-to-1 margin seems worth paying attention to — especially because, for so many people, disposable income ain’t what it used to be.

One might think that more than 84,000 U.S. deaths from the disease would have put life in perspective for adults involved in a kid’s game. One might think that money wouldn’t matter so much now to a bunch of millionaires and billionaires.

If one thinks that, one might be a complete idiot.

Baseball players are complaining about owners trying to pull a fast one on them with revenue splits as they negotiate to start the season, probably because the owners usually are trying to pull a fast one. And the owners surely are wondering why the players’ union is being a pain in the butt under such trying circumstances for the nation. Answer: The players’ union is always a pain in the butt.

With the country craving sports, the two sides are arguing over who gets what if and when the season starts in July, a plan the owners recently approved. The players are worried that the owners are using the pandemic to introduce a salary cap to the game, a non-starter for the union. The arguing might eventually give way to peace and an agreement, but it’s almost beside the point. While the virus was bringing the world to its knees, these rich knuckleheads were fighting over dollars.

I don’t believe Tampa Bay pitcher Blake Snell speaks for all baseball players, but his outlook is so outrageously self-centered that it’s a nice starting point for our discussion of sports and money, which are conjoined at the decimal point. Snell said in a recent video interview that he would not play for a reduced salary this season. He said he’s worried about his health, given the COVID-19 outbreak. He should be.

But for him to tie it to money is so … so … baseball.

“Y’all gotta understand, man, for me to go, for me to take a pay cut is not happening, because the risk is through the roof,’’ said Snell, who was scheduled to make $7 million this season. “It’s a shorter season, less pay. I gotta get my money. I’m not playing unless I get mine, OK? And that’s just the way it is for me.

”Like, I’m sorry you guys think differently, but the risk is way the hell higher and the amount of money I’m making is way lower. Why would I think about doing that? Like, you know, I’m just, I’m sorry.”

You want to talk about a bad look? You could have two noses and three eyes and still look better than this guy. Lest you believe Snell is a lone wolf, Phillies star Bryce Harper said: “Somebody’s gotta say it. At least he manned up and said it. Good for him.’’

Here are words to live by: If you’re looking for greed, big-time sports will never let you down. There’s something comforting about that. It’s nice to know that, in a constantly changing blur of a world, there’s something you can count on. You can also count on death.

I’m ashamed to admit that part of me thought there was no way in the world the two sides would get bogged down in money. Surely, I thought, everyone involved would realize how bad financial wrangling would look in this climate. What’s the word everyone uses now? Optics. Right. Arguing over money would be terrible optics.

Forgive me my naiveté.

There are still plenty of concerns over how baseball can return safely in this scary new world. Is it realistic to think that teams can hold the virus at bay while teammates are around each other daily and competing against other players? Is it possible to keep a clubhouse free of germs? Isn’t that like trying to tell a 3-year-old to stay out of the mud? What happens when someone tests positive for COVID-19? Nationals pitcher Sean Doolittle was correct when he pointed out recently that the players union and Major League Baseball officials had skipped right past health and safety issues in favor of conversation about logistics. Read: money.

They can’t help themselves. They just can’t.

But they need to know there could be a price to pay if they allow their haggling to become protracted. They would be wise to remember how angry fans were after the 1994-95 strike and how that anger led to empty seats for several years.

Baseball fans want baseball back. That’s the prize. But they’d like it to be safe for everyone involved. And they’d like it without the greed that pervades professional sports.

Ernesto was not a healthy boy, to be sure.

Since age 6, he had suffered the effects of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a genetic nerve condition that weakens muscles, usually of the lower extremities but sometimes respiratory muscles as well.

Opinion

Ernesto used a wheelchair or a walker and the help of his mother each morning to get out to the street in the front of their Gage Park bungalow to catch a van that until recently took him to Marquez Elementary, an ACERO charter school.

Ernesto also suffered from asthma and obstructive sleep apnea, two other underlying health problems with potentially serious consequences that have figured into many other COVID-19 deaths, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office.

But make no mistake, doctors say it was the coronavirus that caused the pneumonia that took Ernesto’s life early Thursday morning at Advocate Christ Medical Center, Oak Lawn.

Because his death occurred after midnight, it is not yet counted among the 3,928 official COVID-19 deaths in Illinois, but it was listed among the single-day record high of 126 deaths reported Thursday from Cook County by the medical examiner.

None of those individuals were younger than Ernesto. Previously, the youngest known victim was a 19-year-old man from Riverdale, who died April 10.

Early in the pandemic, state officials announced the death of a 9-month-old infant that they attributed to COVID, but that death remains under investigation by the Cook County Medical Examiner and has never been officially determined to be caused by the virus.

Will the death of a 12-year-old boy cause more people to take this disease seriously?

I doubt it.

Even now, I know someone is reading this and saying “but children die all the time,” and that is true. Children die all the time, and I realize more of them have died of something other than COVID-19 in the two months we’ve been in lockdown.

Still, what if he’s just the first child to die as the disease continues to spread, indeed if it accelerates as we accommodate the desires of those who want to visit their favorite bars and restaurants, or more to the point, the more understandable desire for the owners of those businesses to try to make money again?

There are other vulnerable children. Do we sacrifice them for the sake of the economy, knowing that the financial crisis will take its own toll?

I don’t know the answer to that. Personally, I wouldn’t want to take the risk just yet, but it’s easy for me to say, my family still secure and everyone drawing a paycheck.

Sometime in the last two months, Ernesto’s family moved from the Gage Park home to Indiana, neighbors said. A “For Rent” sign hung Thursday in the window.

In fact, the neighbors did not know Ernesto’s name, not even the children who lived across the street, because Ernesto did not come out and play with the other children, apparently because of his health.

A GoFundMe page that was opened Thursday to support his family showed Ernesto in a white suit at church. First communion maybe? Sorry, I don’t know my religious rituals. But I see a sweet boy.

Officials from Marquez Elementary issued a statement saying they were heartbroken to learn of his death.

“Ernesto was a cherished member of the Marquez community joining our family in Kindergarten through most of his sixth-grade year. Although he and his family recently relocated, he was still one of our Marshals and kept in close touch with his Marquez friends and teachers. He was a special member of our school community.”

“Ernesto loved Fortnite, art projects, science experiments, jokes and riddles, spending time with friends, and is remembered for being an incredibly sweet and loving confidant to everyone he met. We love Ernesto and will miss him with our whole heart.”

I reached a family member by phone. Through her tears, she said she did not speak English.

The man who came on the line next said politely: “We have no comment at this time.”

I’ll have to let their GoFundMe page do the talking.

Since his first surgery for Charcot-Marie-Tooth, Ernesto “has been fighting for his life with his strong spirit,” it states.

“While he may have been taken from us at such a young age, we will never forget the importance of unity and family he valued so much. He was constantly surrounded by love and happiness, and we know he’s made an impact on anyone he’s met.”

Take this seriously, folks. Take it very seriously, because the life you risk may not be your own.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Most are nearing the end of their competitive sports days, and you hate to see them robbed.

For younger kids, I see a silver lining. It’s a chance for them to do more bike riding. They can learn to rollerblade or skateboard. Maybe they can join their parents for runs or walks.

They could get a much-needed break from an over-scheduled life, especially when it comes to sports.

Or, maybe not. In Missouri, a 40-team youth baseball tournament was held last weekend by GameTime Tournaments. You won’t see this in Illinois right now because of the stay-at-home order to curb the spread of the virus. But, at least one Illinois team, the Black Sox from central Illinois, made the trip, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

GameTime instituted social distancing guidelines, including no high-fives, and sanitized the ball often. But some things can’t be helped in baseball: The catcher always will be positioned behind the batter. Players bump into each other on some plays. Out of habit, coaches are bound to get close to players to give instruction.

After being at home for weeks, the games had to be a relief for the players and parents who watched. But 40 teams? That’s downright irresponsible, even if permissible by Missouri’s looser restrictions related to the virus.

Fewer games, or no games for a year, could be a very good thing for kids.

Almost from the time they’re born, too many kids heed a schedule. At 5, you can be signed up for sports leagues. There are 7-year-olds who practice four or five days a week, whether it’s football, soccer or baseball, followed by games on the weekends.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends 60 minutes of daily physical activity for kids in grade school through high school. The kids don’t need to be part of an expensive organized team to get it. But we’ve lost our creativity and spontaneity. The days of neighborhood kids putting together sandlot games went away decades ago.

I know young adults who started sports early, some at 5, and by the time they reached middle school, they didn’t want to practice. Losses got shrugged off because there was always another game.

They burned out. Five years ago, participation studies showed that about 70% of children quit playing sports by the time they are 13.

A friend’s daughter, who had the ability to play soccer in college on a scholarship, stunned her parents when she dropped her club early in her teens. She had tired of it.

Our friends had invested thousands of dollars in games, training and cross-country travel. They had counted on that scholarship. I covered high school sports for nine years as a reporter and met many parents who had done the same. Parents are better off investing early in their children’s college tuition instead of spending lots on expensive sports clubs and personal coaches.

In youth sports, for every knowledgeable coach, you can find others who just aren’t very good, though they mean well.

Some don’t know how to train athletes properly. Some encourage kids to specialize in one sport year-round. The more games, the better — that’s the thinking of some coaches, parents and kids.

Studies show that specializing in one sport contributes to a higher rate of injuries, especially from physical overuse.

“There’s plenty of data that says it’s much better to play multiple sports,” Dr. James P. Bradley told me. He’s the head orthopedic surgeon for the Pittsburgh Steelers and president of the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine based in Rosemont.

Bradley told me about a 13-year-old patient whose father had him throwing lots of pitches in baseball.

“ ‘You know, you’re ruining his shoulder,’ ” Bradley told the father. “ ‘Let him play basketball, run track. When he’s growing whiskers, then we get him throwing curveballs.’ ”

Let kids engage in more “free play,” as doctors call it. It’s unstructured time to run around, free of parental interference, yet critical for physical and emotional development. It’s about kids trying different sports. It lets kids be kids.

The coronavirus will put some limits on that for now, but it should be the goal.

Everybody else in the White House has to wear them, and Boss Trump reportedly yells at people who get too close. But he’s no sniveling Democrat taking sensible precautions.

Of course, real men also don’t wear cake makeup, girdles or platform shoes. For that matter, most don’t spend hours each day on their damn hair.

Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.

So, no, I won’t be taking lessons in masculinity from Trump, last seen running away from two journalists — Weijia Jiang of CBS News and CNN’s Kaitlan Collins — who had the temerity to ask why he sneered that Jiang should ask China the “nasty” question she’d asked about testing for COVID-19.

The CBS correspondent immigrated to the U.S. from China with her parents at age 2. She was raised in West Virginia and educated at the College of William & Mary. She’s as American as Trump. But all he can see is her race.

So you’d think he’d like Collins, a onetime University of Alabama sorority girl. But Collins also stands up to him. Last month, he tried to get her banished to the back row of the briefing room, but she stood her ground. (The White House Correspondents Association handles seating arrangements.) When he saw her shining face in the front row, Trump fled the room.

Of course, that was soon after his crackpot suggestion that doctors inject disinfectants into COVID-19 patients’ lungs, so perhaps it was just as well.

The ostensible purpose of Trump’s most recent Rose Garden appearance was to brag that the United States now leads the world in the total number of COVID-19 tests. It’s true that progress has been made, just not nearly enough. This country also leads the world in fatalities by a wide margin. With roughly 5% of the world’s population, Americans comprise more than 25% of the dead.

Shocking, isn’t it? A stunning failure of crisis management. Polls increasingly show that White House efforts are failing to convince Americans otherwise. Michigan surveys say that 72% of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s constituents approve of her decisive handling of the pandemic; only 39% think well of Trump’s performance.

Yet he urged on a ragged crowd of toy soldiers who descended upon the Michigan state house carrying guns. “LIBERATE Michigan,” Trump tweeted. He derided the state’s governor as “Half Whitmer,” in one of his typically witless junior high school-style insults.

Women voters are likely to punish him for that. So you’d have to suspect that Michigan, an important swing state come November, is gone. Ditto Pennsylvania, where the numbers are 72% and 45%, respectively. Another swing state lost, even if Joe Biden hadn’t grown up there.

Thirty-nine percent, see, is sufficient to summon a mob, but not to win an election. Also, carrying a gun to a political demonstration will definitely get you on TV. But it pretty much guarantees that you’re losing the argument. People do resent being bullied.

They’re also resistant to having a matter of personal survival turned into a partisan issue. Thanks to Dr. Anthony Fauci and his colleagues, Americans broadly understand the realities of the pandemic and the dangers of “reopening the economy” too soon.

Everybody, absolutely everybody, wants to see normal life return as soon as possible. Me, I’m just lost without baseball. I worry about people I know in the restaurant business, and I’d give a lot to be able to meet friends at the joint down the street for a cold one and a mess of fried catfish.

But I wouldn’t give my health or my wife’s. Or my sons’ or my neighbors’. My grandfather Michael Sheedy died in the 1919 Spanish flu epidemic — that is, after the first wave of infection passed in 1918, only to come back stronger when people convinced themselves it had gone away. It would be catastrophic to see something similar happen again.

As is quite likely if Boss Trump succeeds in bullying his more heedless supporters into taking foolish risks. Biden recently put it this way in a Washington Post column:

”President Trump is reverting to a familiar strategy of deflecting blame and dividing Americans. His goal is as obvious as it is craven: He hopes to split the country into dueling camps, casting Democrats as doomsayers hoping to keep America grounded and Republicans as freedom fighters trying to liberate the economy.”

As Biden points out, it’s a false choice. These people you see crowding unmasked into just-opened restaurants, rubbing elbows and carrying signs bragging, “I won’t trade my freedom for your safety” are worse than fools.

They’ve joined a political death cult.

Meanwhile, everybody in the West Wing gets tested every day. They’re contact-tracing and self-isolating as every workplace should in order to control the disease until a vaccine can be found.

But masks are for protecting other people, and that’s not something Boss Trump has ever cared about.

An ancient woman, whose pleadings will haunt me to my death, sat in a hallway in a wheelchair endlessly shouting, “Help me! Help me!” with her arms outstretched.

I ran to the nursing station nearby, where many people were busily working but ignoring the patient in need. “That woman needs help,” I barked.

A nurse, nurse’s assistant, attendant or someone in a uniform whose rank I could not identify slowly turned their head toward me from the paperwork they were working on at the time.

Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.

“She does not need help,” this person said very firmly. “That is just what she does.”

I was convinced that this nursing home employee was a wretched person, as were they all. No feeling individual could turn a deaf ear to such cries of anguish. I walked over to the woman myself and said, “Can I help you?”

“Help me,” the tiny woman cried. “Help me!” There was no further explanation.

Years passed. I grew older. Visited many nursing homes. And eventually placed my father in one.

And one day, that tough old man, that World War II veteran, that survivor of the Great Depression, who as far as I know never asked anything from anyone, was sitting in his wheelchair in a hallway shouting, “Help me!”

“What, Dad?” I asked. “What do you need?”

He looked at me with searching eyes and said, “I don’t know.”

I came to the conclusion that he wanted out. Out of his predicament. Not just out of the nursing home, that wretched place where people wait for the end, but out of his body and out of the muddle that perplexed his mind.

It is a terrible place to be. To live or to work. To even think about.

I suppose that is why so many of us refuse to visit long-term care facilities, even before COVID-19 struck, before there was a quarantine.

I would visit my father every day. But I was usually alone. That didn’t make me better than other people. It did make me a little more mentally unstable during that time, I suspect.

It is said that for most states, a third of COVID-19 deaths are in long-term care facilities. In 14 states, more than half of the virus deaths are in such places.

Political leaders must do something to help our elderly, shriek those with grandmothers, grandfathers, aunts and uncles, mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, in such places.

And political leaders themselves shout that something must be done.

Yet, we know what these places are. We always have.

They are underfunded. Inspections are haphazard. They are often money factories. They are far too often warehouses, storage facilities, for those waiting to die.

That is not to say we don’t love the people inside. In fact, often we love them too much to see them waste away. It is terrifying to watch such a thing.

And so we leave underpaid, overworked and too often uncaring people to deal with the dirty work. We don’t want to look.

What happens when we don’t look is the same thing that always happens when people turn away. Abuse. Neglect. Incompetence.

There are sometimes angels at work in these places. I have seen them with my own eyes. They care. They pay a personal price I cannot imagine.

But when I hear howls of righteous indignation on this issue from the public and their representatives, I am reminded of the false outrage that erupts following a mass shooting by people who are mentally ill.

We are all standing on the “Help me!” floor listening to the anguished cries. I sometimes wonder if that’s my own pathetic voice I hear joining the chorus.

She’s a nurse, in the emergency department at Mount Sinai Hospital.

Latona certainly doesn’t consider herself heroic.

“No, I don’t,” she said. “I wake up every morning and I come to work and do my job.”

A job that demands she tend to the sick and the dying for 12 hours at a stretch. To juggle patients, rooms, medicines, doses, equipment, colleagues, hours, breaks, all the time keeping focused on the central task: making people well again.

“We’ve been saving lives the entire time,” she said, admitting that since the COVID-19 pandemic hit Chicago in mid-March, things have changed.

“This is a different time,” she said. “But I’ve continued to show up to work and do what I do.”

Latona never knows what’s coming through the door.

“This is a trauma center,” she said. “We still have gunshots, car accidents. Kids still fall off bunk beds. Now there are extra precautions. We have to go under the assumption that everyone is positive until they’ve proven negative. The COVID adds a little bit of extra stress.”

That “little bit of extra stress” has to be heroic, the modesty of the truly courageous, since most folks feel extra stress going to the supermarket, never mind having to intubate COVID-19 patients in an ongoing worldwide crisis hitting nursing much harder than most professions.

Nurses are the tip of the spear. The National Nurses Union reports at least 50 nurses have died in the United States from the coronavirus, and some 10,000 have been sickened by it. The only reason the death toll isn’t higher is because nurses tend to be younger, and fitter. Latona says her main hobby outside the hospital is working out.

She is one of almost 4 million registered nurses in the United States. Since Tuesday is International Nurses Day, it’s worth mentioning that there are 20 million nurses in the world, according to the World Health Organization.

If you haven’t heard of International Nurses Day, that isn’t because it’s new — the celebration began in 1965. It’s on May 12 because it’s the birthday of British nurse Florence Nightingale, who was in charge of nursing in military hospitals in Turkey during the Crimean War. Like nurses ever since, she had to overcome hostile doctors, who at first would not allow the new female nurses in the hospital wards. And like today, Nightingale battled obstinate authorities to get desperately-needed equipment, which she often dug into her pocket to pay for. Nightingale shrugged off attempts to honor her after the war, taking the collection grateful Londoners had taken up for her benefit and using it to found a nursing school in 1860, the first in the world.

Asked what she likes most about nursing, Latona replied:

“Our team here, we have such a strong team. We’re like family. We’re showing up. We’re picking up extra shifts. We’re filling in holes where we need to. We’re helping each other so much.”

Pandemic hits home

Latona grew up in Bensenville, her father a Mexican immigrant. Before she worked at Mount Sinai, she worked at a clinic for underserved patients. “I just really enjoyed working with that population,” she said. “Low-income, uninsured, immigrants with no paperwork. I could relate. Just because they’re here doesn’t mean they don’t deserve to be cared for.”

Her husband is a lawyer, and they have three young children: two boys, Theodore and Benjamin, 6 and 3, and a girl, Victoria, 22 months.

“My oldest always says, ‘Do you have to go to work?’ I say, ‘Yes, I have to go help sick people.’ He’s said, ‘Mom, I want to go to work to help sick people.’ He understands. All the kids understand when I come home, nobody can touch me until I take a shower.”

Latona feels safe, feels confident coming home to her husband and children.

“I do,” she said. “We feel comfortable. We’re taking the proper precautions. My kids are all really healthy, we have no preexisting conditions. My husband said, ‘Do you want to quarantine in a hotel?’ and I said, ‘Who knows how long I’ll be gone?’ ”

Victoria is named after her mother, “probably my best friend, probably the strongest person. I know.”

“She was a huge caregiver for my kids,” said Latona. Then her mother was diagnosed with COVID-19.

“She got sick back in March, right when this took off,” Latona said. “She was intubated, in the ICU for three weeks.”

Being a nurse, Latona knew what being intubated meant: About 90% of people who go on ventilators don’t survive.

“The worst part was, she was alone. I couldn’t go to the hospital with her,” Latona said. “She is in the ER by herself. She calls me and says, ‘They want to intubate me.’ I immediately started crying, because I knew what that meant. I hung up thinking, ‘Was that the last time I talked to my mother?’”

Latona had to care for everyone but the one person she most wanted to care for.

“It was definitely hard to come to work, seeing everything here; trying to focus, trying not to think of my mom,” said Latona. “I want to be present and care for my patient. Especially knowing what my mom is going through.”

Her mother is off the ventilator and recovering; in an odd way, her getting sick made her daughter an even better nurse.

“The fact my mom is by herself, it makes me more empathetic and understanding of the stress family members are feeling, the panic they are having,” Latona said. “Sometimes we’ll get phone calls from the family, and before you might feel, ‘We’re trying to do work!’ Now there is realization: They’re scared. I completely get it. The patient is scared. The family is scared they can’t be there, and they don’t know what’s going on.”

Second career

Latona wasn’t one of those girls who grew up bandaging her dolls and taking their temperature. Nursing wasn’t on her radar.

“It was actually a second career for me,” she said. She went to Illinois State, studied marketing, soon found herself wrangling the Shrek toys that went into McDonald’s Happy Meals.

“I was thinking: ‘What did I accomplish today?’ I felt very unfulfilled, not happy with it. I was thinking: ‘I want to do something to help people.’ I always liked science, and I always liked people. I was having a conversation with my mom, and she said, ‘I wish I had gone to nursing school.’ That got me thinking that’s the route I want to go. I went to nursing school.”

And what part of nursing is more fulfilling than marketing?

“All of it,” she replied. “In the emergency room you learn something new every day. You never feel stagnant. You ask, ‘What can I do?’ and there is always something to improve on, something to learn. The fun part of medicine is you’re never done learning what you can do better.

“We are such a family here. If you see somebody struggling, you go over to help them. ‘Give me something to do; what do you need?’ I never feel alone at my job.”

And COVID-19? Another chance for nurses to step up and shine.

“Even with everything going on personally, after all this started, I never called in [to take time off]. I felt I owed it to my work family to be here and help them.”

Five years into the profession, Latona has found her home.

“Something about nursing just called to me, and I’ve been very happy in that decision,” she said. “I don’t see myself doing anything else ever. You’re always learning something.”

Like Marines, like firefighters, there’s an annealed-in-flame quality to nursing. They’ve gone through the worst, together, which makes them strong, as a group and as individuals.

“It’s all pretty true,” she said. “We’re a tough group of people. We love our job. We see the worst of the worst. The ER is hard because we see somebody’s worst day, every day. We go from somebody passed away in that room, the worst day of that life, and we go in the next room, and that person is having the worst day of their life. That’s why our job is hard. It gets hard.”

Hard, though the job is not without benefits. The praise can be a little embarrassing. But the food is appreciated.

“We’re been very spoiled, lunch provided for us, really frequently,” she said. “We don’t think of ourselves as heroes. We’re just showing up doing our job. That said, we’re not going to say no to a nice lunch.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

They now want to have all their grandkids over to play and are upset with me because I refuse.

Tell her this is why you have chosen to follow the directions issued by the Centers for Disease Control. You wish she and your dad would be more careful about their own health, but you respect that they are adults making their own choices, and you expect that she will extend to you the same courtesy.

DEAR ABBY: I recently gave a family member a gift. Immediately upon opening it, they exclaimed, “I don’t want this! I will never use this. Can I return it and get something else?” This was followed by repeatedly saying they didn’t want the item and dragging out of the closet a similar item another family member had given them, exclaiming, “See? I already have almost the exact same thing, and I’ve never used it.”

This relative kept repeating they didn’t ever want anything like this and what I should always get them. This is the same person, by the way, who buys me whatever they want to get me whether I want it or not, and refuses to listen when I state what I would like as gifts. Am I too sensitive, or is this behavior bad manners? — GIFT HORSE IN WYOMING

DEAR GIFT HORSE: It’s an example of appalling bad manners and lack of gratitude. Because the relative is also unwilling or unable to choose appropriate gifts, why not agree to stop exchanging them? In cases like this, a nice, neutral greeting card would cause fewer hurt feelings.

DEAR ABBY: My husband and I disagree about something, and I’d like you to be the tie-breaker.

The 300-guest wedding of her dreams, and those of her 40-year-old fiance, Jake Avery, will happen once a COVID-19 vaccine is in place. For now, a close friend recently ordained will marry them in their yard June 6.

Their approach, born of necessity, is a play on micro weddings, the first choice for some couples looking for a more intimate experience or unable to afford splashier affairs.

Before the pandemic so dramatically changed lives, 20,000 to 30,000 weddings happened every weekend in the U.S., with more than 550,000 originally planned for April, May and June this year, according to data from the wedding planning site TheKnot.com.

Worldwide, 93% of couples whose weddings are impacted by the virus are rescheduling, with only 7% canceling altogether, the site said.

The average cost of weddings pre-pandemic was teetering at just under $34,000, and the average guest count at 131.

Nicole Ochoa and Brad Wilkinson, both 27, had an initial guest list of 200-plus before choosing to go micro for their July nuptials. Really, really micro. The Sonoma County, California, couple decided on fewer than a dozen guests for the wedding on a ranch near home that overlooks estate vineyards.

“We just really wanted it to be personal,” Ochoa said. “I hope that other people can pause and consider this as an option. It feels like the wedding industry and wedding trends have turned into such a show.”

Guest lists of 50 or fewer accounted for just 8 percent of U.S. weddings last year, down from 10 percent the year before, according to The Knot, which surveys more than 25,000 couples annually. Weddings with 51 to 150 guests encompassed 54 percent of couples.

Kristen Maxwell Cooper, editor in chief of The Knot, said couples who want to keep their original plans but worry that virus restrictions will drive their guest counts down might consider “shift weddings.”

Once conditions allow, she said, “They can host their ceremony with a group of 25 of their guests while live-streaming to the rest of their loved ones, followed by a reception with the same group who attended the ceremony for a few hours before the next group of guests arrive.”

With the second of three deposits due on their venue, Ochoa and Wilkinson are in the process of asking for a “force majeure” clause in their contract so they can get their money back in case virus restrictions remain in place.

“If the venue denies our request, we’ve decided to keep the date and get married in Nicole’s parent’s Sonoma County backyard,” Wilkinson said.

Ochoa added: “We would be incredibly sad if we can’t be married at the venue we fell so hard for, but there’s something pretty magical about the thought of walking across the lawn in my dress with my Dad, too.”

Vendors focused on micro weddings and organized elopements have seen an uptick in interest since the virus struck, but some couples were ahead of that curve.

Melissa Todd, 50, and Jeffrey Hall, 59, used PopTheKnot.com for their $7,000 elopement with seven guests. They married last November in Chicago, where they live, and wanted to do something quick.

“I’m just one of those people who never dreamed of a big elaborate wedding,” Todd said. “I’m pretty mellow.”

Pop the Knot makes use of downtime at venues around the country. It operates in nine cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Austin, Texas.

“We already were quite busy, but sadly we have been receiving a ton of emails from clients that had their weddings canceled due to COVID and are now wanting to do a small pop-up,” said owner and wedding planner Michele Velazquez.

SimplyEloped.com offers low-cost packages in destinations including the Florida Keys, Lake Tahoe and New Orleans.

“Since the coronavirus outbreak, I’ve had numerous couples come to me every day with similar stories: They’re canceling their big wedding due to travel complications, not wanting to assemble a big group of people or other virus-related problems,” said the site’s editor, Karen Norian.

“These couples are heartbroken, not just about the financial losses, but the thought of pushing their marriages out to some ambiguous future date is devastating,” she said.

Renee McCarthy, 33, and her husband, Ryan McCarthy, live in San Diego and wed at Temecula Creek Inn in Temecula, California, in March 2019, with 24 guests attending.

“We both wanted to focus on the guests we did have there, our families and closest friends” Renee said. “Even for a small wedding it was overwhelming trying to put it together, but we couldn’t be happier with how our wedding turned out.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Combined, they account for some of the biggest economic and labor casualties of the COVID-19 pandemic as stay-at home-orders have grounded potential customers and diners and put businesses on the brink.

While financial recovery programs still find their footing, in the past couple of weeks, a few Illinois small businesses have discovered a different kind of lifeline thanks to a wave of national exposure that has put an emphasis on goods from Chicago and beyond.

“We now have something we didn’t have before — hope,” said Lake Forest resident Cindy Kienzle, the founder and owner of The Hungry Monkey Baking Co., after her baked goods were evangelized by comedian/TV personality Howie Mandel on the growing online platform Talkshop Live.

It’s a “live streaming selling vehicle for anyone, anywhere at any time,” said Talkshop Live co-founder Bryan Moore. Or, as others like Forbes have playfully called it, “QVC meets Facebook Live.”

Launched two years ago, the social media retail platform was inspired by a mission to “save Main Street” and offers member business owners the chance to have a “storefront” without the overhead. Once registered on the free app, members are given a dedicated online channel, and followers are automatically notified any time the member business goes live.

“[Membership] has gone up considerably post COVID-19,” said Moore. “We are finding a lot of people are starting to use us as a resource to stay viable.”

The Talkshop Live team had been in talks with Mandel, the “America’s Got Talent” judge (and a one-time carpet salesman), before the pandemic hit. But as soon as stores started shutting down, Mandel partnered with the platform in a “Save Small Business America” campaign. Mandel pitches his favorite products in bi-weekly episodes; members can also submit an application on Mandel’s Talkshop Live page.

The first episode ran April 1 and featured The Hungry Monkey Baking Co.’s Social Distancing Treat Boxes, a gift box that includes loaves of traditional banana bread, chocolate chip banana bread as well as two small bags of triple chocolate brownies. All come from Kienzle’s homemade recipes and are made in a commercial kitchen in Northbrook.

“I’ve always had a dream to own a bakery,” Kienzle said, and by 2010 she had started her small business in the Northfield Farmer’s Market and is now selling in local food emporiums such as Sunset Foods and Olivia’s Market.

“When the pandemic hit, it’s not the kind of product you are going to necessarily Instacart,” she added. “And I was concerned about what was going to happen.”

So, Kienzle became an early adopter of Talkshop Live. Mandel came across her channel while looking for businesses to profile, and was particularly moved by Kienzle’s 12-year-old daughter Lily who has special needs and helps her mother assemble the gift boxes. In his pitch for the product, Mandel said the banana bread “is beyond anything I have ever eaten” and his testimonial helped Kienzle increase sales from about 150 to 200 gift boxes in a year to 800 within a month.

“Plus, we have received many calls from corporate clients wishing to donate Hungry Monkey [products] to our local communities, and to cheer up clients and their staff,” Kienzle said. “…For our tiny company it’s incredible.”

The April 15 edition of Mandel’s show featured Save The Girls, a maker of fashionable and functional cellphone purses, based in Belleville, Illinois.

“All within the same week, my two daughters lost their iPhones. One out on a walking trail and the other accidentally left hers in a pair of jeans she washed,” recalls owner Tami Lange. “As I was talking about the issue with my sister-in-law, she pulls her own phone out of her bra — the woman has breast cancer! I knew there had to be a better way to protect your phone.”

Lange’s company, which launched a cell phone “touchscreen purse” design that allows for ease of functionality and protection, sold $1 million in its first year in 2018, $3 million in 2019 and was on track to sell $5 million this year — until COVID-19 hit.

“We are in about 2,500 retail locations that were all shut down,” says Lange. “As a result, our sales went down by over 95%.” Lange’s sister told her about Mandel’s program and she filled out an application. Mandel, a well-known germaphobe, loved the design for its “germ-free” aspect as well as the fact that Lange donates 10% of profits to breast cancer research.

Bucktown’s popular dining spot Mable’s Table also got a national exposure business boost after being featured in a segment on “Good Morning America” in late April.

“We received a call from one of the producers who had some friends that lived in our neighborhood,” said chef/owner Anthony Reyes.

The restaurant is currently offering curbside service and deliveries through Caviar and Grubhub. The “GMA” segment also highlighted Reyes’ efforts to help his neighbors during the coronavirus pandemic. He has donated rolls of toilet paper, paper towels, soap and flour to anyone in the neighborhood in need — inspired to do his part after witnessing the work of his wife who is a nurse practitioner, and his brother, a Chicago police officer.

The “GMA” segment also featured a “how-to” for making the restaurant’s famous jumbo meatballs.

“The menu is based on good old-fashioned home cooking, and I think a lot of people at home are focused on that now, too,” said Reyes.

Before the pandemic, the restaurant was serving about 1,000 people a week, but once the restaurant closed its doors, the 30-employee staff went down to five people. “The one thing most important to me is to be able to bring them all back,” said Reyes, hoping the national exposure will help in that mission.

“Usually I sell about 150 meatballs throughout the week, but in two days I’ve sold almost 400,” he said. “People from as far as Georgia have been calling and e-mailing to get a hold of the recipe and calculating conversions.”

Reyes is appreciative of “GMA” giving the restaurant a voice, and said: “I would love when things get back to normal to have people come in here and say ‘I saw you on the show, I want to try to those meatballs!’”

“We think that there’s going to be substantial improvement this summer,” Clorox chairman and CEO Benno Dorer told Yahoo Finance in an interview. “It’s going to be touch and go until then, unfortunately.”

Shoppers have become increasingly frustrated as they scour the internet and local stores for Lysol sprays and Clorox wipes, only to find shelves picked clean after households stocked up on cleaning products to protect against infection, especially in COVID-19 hot zones.

Manufacturers like Clorox were not prepared for skyrocketing demand in a sleepy sector with reliably steady sales that usually fluctuate only during flu season.

On a third-quarter earnings call last week, Dorer told analysts that Clorox saw demand for disinfectant products increase more than 500%.

“Demand has been clearly unprecedented, and we’re in uncharted territory for our supply chain, in particular, in disinfecting products,” he said.

Products such as Clorox 4-in-1 Disinfecting Spray and Lysol Disinfectant Spray are among the products that the Environmental Protection Agency says likely protect against the spread of the coronavirus.

Disinfectant manufacturers have cranked up production, narrowed the number of products they make and have invested in increased capacity to try to catch up with skyrocketing demand.

“To try and meet demand to the greatest extent possible, we’ve been running our cleaning and disinfecting product plants 24/7,” Dorer told analysts last week. “To increase output, we’ve accessed third-party supply sources focused on manufacturing of disinfecting products and those that can be supplied most quickly, and we’ve been partnering with suppliers and retailers to get product where it is needed the most.”

Tom Derry, CEO of the Institute for Supply Management, told USA TODAY last month that shoppers would not be able to easily buy disinfectant wipes and other cleaning products again until June. But he predicted intermittent shortages could persist for months.

Last week, Clorox reported that third-quarter sales rose 15%, buoyed by purchases of bleach, wipes and other cleaning products. The company’s cleaning segment, which includes disinfectant wipes, bleach and Pine-Sol, saw sales growth of 32%, the company reported.

Should I start growing my own?

A good idea, said Lisa Hilgenberg, a horticulturalist at the Chicago Botanic Garden in Glencoe.

Think of it as “self reliance,” if you like, said Hilgenberg. But it’s also a good way to celebrate Earth Day and Arbor Day — Wednesday and Friday, respectively — while getting outside, even if it’s only to fill a few pots on a high-rise balcony.

“You really learn by doing,” Hilgenberg said. “Start small and just plant something.”

Despite the recent snow in the Chicago area, it’s not too early to begin planting “cool season” seeds outside, including, lettuce, cabbage, carrots, radishes, arugula and others.

“Vegetable gardening is all about timing,” she said. “It’s the perfect time to do that.”

If you’re worried about rabbits devouring the fruits — and veggies — of your labor, consider planting a ring of onions or garlic [which they don’t like] or building a low fence around your vegetable patch, Hilgenberg said.

“Read the back of the seed packet and learn about planting depth and spacing,” she said. “You don’t need a big garden to plant some things you can harvest from.”

It’s also a good time to plant fruit trees, such as apple or pear varieties. They’re best planted as “bare root” trees and when they’re dormant, Hilgenberg said. Consider also stone-fruit trees such as those bearing peaches, nectarines or cherries — but make sure they’re the hardy kind, specially bred to to tolerate Midwest weather.

And it’s not too early to start growing — in seed trays kept inside — “warm season” crops, including tomatoes, eggplant and peppers, among other vegetables. Or if you like herbs, consider dill, oregano, fennel or basil — plants that can be taken outside when consistently warmer weather arrives in late May or early June.

If you’d like some color in your garden, consider nasturtiums, pansies, violets or snap dragons at this time of year.

Mistakes are to be expected among novice gardeners.

“Look at Thomas Jefferson, who gardened for 40 years. And he started over and tried again every one of those 40 years,” Hilgenberg said. “Then he came back with another new tool in his toolbox to attack things in a different way.”

But remember that along with the hard work, gardening is supposed to be soothing — an escape from life’s worries.

“Be sure to remember to stop and smell the flowers and enjoy that beauty, which really is so uplifting — not to mention all the vitamin D you’re getting from working out in the sunshine,” Hilgenberg said.

On Saturday, the mayor’s decision to start delivering on the central promise of her corruption-fighting mayoral campaign came back to haunt the residents of Little Village, several aldermen now say.

Armed with a city demolition permit that local Ald. Mike Rodriguez (22nd) said he was powerless to block, a subcontractor hired by Hilco Redevelopment Partners demolished a 95-year-old smokestack at the site of a shuttered coal-fired power plant without abiding by the safety measures it had promised to implement.

That caused a giant plume of dust to rain down on the area, potentially creating a public health hazard in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. Homes, vehicles, streets and sidewalks were left filthy.

On Tuesday, Rodriguez said he would have delayed the smokestack demolition if he could have and twice tried to do just that, only to be told by the city the project would proceed.

He now plans to introduce an ordinance requiring so-called “special-use permits” from the Zoning Board of Appeals before future large-scale demolitions.

“In that special-use permit, there will be much more strict guidelines and much more community engagement and aldermanic power,” said Rodriguez, who lives five blocks from the demolition site. “I ran a non-profit organization for eight years. We were about organizing community members to take power. That’s what we need to empower here.”

Aldermen Brian Hopkins (2nd) and Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th) couldn’t agree more.

They argue that Lightfoot’s decision to consolidate permitting power in the mayor’s office means she “owns” the Little Village debacle as much as she said Hilco does.

Hopkins noted that during his first-term as alderman, he presided over “one of the most extensive demolition projects” in Chicago’s history — on the site of the Lincoln Yards project. That demolition included: Finkl Steel; a 100,000 square-foot fleet maintenance facility with more than 20 underground storage tanks filled with hazardous chemicals; a rubber recycling company; a tannery, and a variety of other large industrial structures.

“I was consulted every step of the way. Involved in the decision-making process. The dust mitigation, the environmental remediation, scheduling it at a time when it would be less disruptive to the neighborhood,” Hopkins said Tuesday. “Contrast that with the way the city handled aldermanic involvement in this. Alderman Rodriguez was merely notified at the last minute. He wasn’t told he had veto authority. He wasn’t asked for permission. He was simply informed this was happening. It’s the exact opposite of what I went through.”

When Chicago finally returns to some semblance of normality, Hopkins said, he hopes aldermen will take back their permitting powers.

“An alderman knows that he [or she] will be held responsible for negative consequences of any decision like this. So an alderman is going to approach it much more cautiously. ... We use our aldermanic authority to protect neighborhoods. That’s been taken away from us,” Hopkins said.

“When the COVID-19 crisis subsides and there’s no longer such extreme justification for mayoral authority to be solely concentrated in the hands of one person, we should go back to the way it’s always been in Chicago, where the people who are elected by and accountable to the neighbors are making decisions.”

Sigcho-Lopez argued Lightfoot’s decision to “centralize power” has had “unfortunate and shameful consequences” in Little Village. The same could happen with a concrete plant he opposes in his own ward.

“She can try to point fingers all she wants. But at the end of the day, the departments issued the permit in the first place. She has to own this as much as Hilco owns this,” Sigcho-Lopez said.

The mayor’s office advised Hopkins and Sigcho-Lopez to “re-orient themselves with the facts” before trying to “politicize” the Little Village controversy.

In a statement Tuesday afternoon, Lightfoot’s administration noted “nothing about the building code was changed” by the mayor’s executive order, nor did it “change any demolition practices at the Department of Buildings.” In fact, the Municipal Code “still requires that aldermen receive a 10-day notice period, which allows them to raise any concerns about potentially permitted activity,” the statement said.

The mayor’s office noted: work on the Little Village site began two years before Lightfoot took office; Hopkins was “among the 41 aldermen who supported” Hilco’s warehouse project; and Sigcho Lopez campaigned on “his support of repealing aldermanic prerogative.”

The statement further noted Rodriguez was “heavily involved with the developer, including the CEO of the company, as well as other city departments multiple times” before Saturday’s demolition.

It concluded: “It is simply shameful for politicians like Aldermen Hopkins and Sigcho-Lopez to pontificate about a tragic incident in which people were traumatized all to try to score cheap political points. Their uninformed statements speak volumes about their character and their shameless quest for recognition at someone else’s expense.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

“They own this,” said Lightfoot, who described Hilco’s chief executive as “very contrite and embarrassed” about the demolition of a 95-year-old smokestack.

The result was a giant plume of dust that left homes and vehicles filthy and, potentially, created a public health hazard in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.

“If anybody in the city government or the alderman’s office knew what was represented to us wasn’t actually gonna be followed on site, we would have stopped it in its tracks,” Lightfoot said. “But promises were made. Those promises were not kept.”

Lightfoot promised the city would do “everything we can” for Little Village residents. Street sweepers were dispatched Saturday and Sunday. All will be at Hilco’s expense, the mayor said.

“Hilco’s actually sending a team of people out today to go literally door-to-door to assess what the damages are,” the mayor said.

The company must “mitigate the harm that’s been done to residents and residents’ property,” she added.

“I want cars cleaned. I want streets swept. I want houses to be cleaned of the dust that’s settled. That is the charge I’ve given to my team, and Hilco is gonna have to own responsibility for that.”

Hilco CEO Roberto Perez issued a statement saying Hilco is “sensitive to the concerns of the community” and will continue to work with the city.

Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said the smokestack was tested before the demolition permit was issued. Those reports show asbestos removal took 18 months and was completed Nov. 30 in the main building at the old Crawford power plant.

“There’s nothing in these reports at this time that is suggestive that asbestos would have been a problem,” Arwady said.

“That said, we’re collecting additional information — including some of those samples taken on site — just to make sure that everything was done appropriately.”

Arwady said testing of air samples from the neighborhood is likely to be done by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, as well as its Illinois equivalent.

The Buildings Department issued Hilco a demolition permit to implode the smokestack and other parts of the former power plant March 30, city records show.

Ald. Michael Rodriguez (22nd) said when he was notified of the permit three days later, he asked the city health department if the company had met all requirements.

“I inquired with the city if they were allowed to do this work, and the city said yes,” he said.

Rodriguez said he later asked the health department if the work could be postponed because Hilco had delivered paper notices to some residents only a day before the demolition. The city still gave the go-ahead, Rodriguez said.

Given the late notice to residents, “I did inquire with the city whether putting a pause on the job was an option, and I was told it wasn’t an option, that they had a right to do that work,” Rodriguez said.

“Something obviously went terribly wrong.”

Maryland-based Controlled Demolition was hired to demolish the smokestack.

“Per our contract, any communication involving any of the job goes through Hilco,” said one employee reached over the phone.

Attorney Frank Avila Jr., who plans to sue on behalf of Little Village residents, likened the scene in Little Village to Chernobyl.

Lightfoot bristled, calling it a “really poor choice of words” to compare it to the Russian nuclear power plant disaster.

“I appreciate the hyperbole, but I really don’t think that’s appropriate in this time,” she said.

Lightfoot was asked whether she would support a City Council vote rescinding a $19.7 million subsidy granted to Hilco for its warehouse project on the site.

“I don’t know that there’s any basis for our taking that kind of action. But we’re reviewing everything,” she said.

As the city and Hilco try to mitigate the damage, some nearby residents feel despondent.

Kathryn Ramirez-Mercado, 32, who lives about half a mile from the old power plant, said she heard about the planned demolition Saturday morning through the news.

“My wife went outside that morning and saw the paper left on the floor. I didn’t realize that they’d only given us a day’s notice,” she said.

Ramirez-Mercado said many of her neighbors are young children and elderly residents with underlying health conditions.

“There are so many kids on our block and so many old generations,” Ramirez-Mercado said. “As a resident, it makes me feel like we’re insignificant, we’re voiceless and powerless throughout this process.”

But nature can be a guide to us at this time, providing a model of cooperation, a place to heal, and ways to connect, even at the recommended distance.

Opinion

In nature, cooperation abounds.

As author Peter Wohlleben, of “The Hidden Life of Trees” explored, “[trees] send distress signals about drought and disease, for example, or insect attacks, and other trees alter their behavior when they receive these messages.” While social distancing feels like a sacrifice now, the stay at home order has saved countless lives, from high-risk populations to medical and service professionals. Altering our behavior at this critical time, just as nature does in the face of challenges, is community resilience in action.

Even at a safe distance, nature heals.

One study after another documents its positive effects on physical and mental health for people of all ages and backgrounds. Nature offers balm and solace to the weary — being a source of beauty, wonder, and inspiration. And nature can be found everywhere — including in the trees outside your apartment or home.

Nature connects us.

Looking out your window you can see it, as the birds have begun their grand migration through our region. Living in a major flyway, residents can experience this annual spectacle, just as those thousands of miles away experienced it, reminding us just how interconnected we are.

As we collectively wade through this worldwide pandemic, nature’s resilience should serve as our guide. Through collective cooperation, connection and healing, we will overcome this moment and thrive as nature blooms today.

It is only right that we take this time to reconnect with it.

Many of us are angry at leaders stumbling to protect us during the crisis. It’s healthy and important to convert emotion into action right now.

Opinion

Gov. J.B. Pritzker, his staff, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and legislative leaders have done a phenomenal job of leading us through this crisis in the vacuum of leadership at the federal executive branch. They’ve been right to prioritize our health and safety. As an individual, you can make a difference by staying home, washing your hands and not flushing wet wipes, which clog pipes — the last thing we need right now is clogged sewer systems. Call your friends, family and neighbors to make sure they are doing OK.

It is right to focus on these immediate steps. We must also be vigilant as decision-makers look to dedicate trillions of public dollars to relief packages. Environmental advocates must shift our priorities to make sure these plans are focused on helping the most vulnerable. We can do that by emailing our lawmakers — avoid calling to keep office lines free for emergencies — and expressing the following:

Communities and people should be the center of relief efforts. Union contracts, rights and benefits for low-wage workers, paid sick leave and improved working conditions have always been environmental issues. COVID-19 is not just a public health crisis; it is an environmental and economic justice crisis disproportionately impacting workers and disadvantaged communities already burdened by racism, pollution and compromised immune systems. Tell your lawmakers to support policies that improve worker conditions such as paid sick leave and support low income people — for example, ending utility shutoffs or offering rent support.

Our safety net is under attack and must be rebuilt. The Trump administration has systematically weakened our institutions of government, jeopardizing the safety net for all of us and making us more vulnerable to crises of all kinds. Let’s make sure elected officials know that we must rebuild the agencies that have been decimated by defunding and neglect.

Climate change is exacerbating this crisis. High levels of pollution have put vulnerable communities at greater risk of serious health impacts from COVID-19. Air pollution damages lungs and can cause chronic diseases like asthma, COPD and lung cancer. Scientists expect catastrophic events and pandemics to increase as the climate changes, and this tragedy is showcasing how unprepared we are for that future. Stimulus packages must not subsidize businesses that are contributing to climate change and harming public health. Long-term policy must continue to fight climate change emissions.

Environmental advocacy in this time of crisis needs to address the glaring structural weaknesses in our economic and political system laid bare by the pandemic. We should only consider our economy to be thriving if workers, the environment and communities are protected and healthy.

Once securing your own health and safety, I urge you to contact your elected officials to make sure the world we create after this crisis is more resilient and compassionate than ever before.

The Disney show opened in March 2018 and placed among the top five Broadway productions for both gross and attendance over both years it ran, often pulling in over $1 million, and even $2 million a week.

Until now, only shows that were waiting to officially open have announced postponements or cancellations. Disney still has “The Lion King” and “Aladdin” on Broadway and five productions of “Frozen” worldwide.

Actors’ Equity Association, which represents 51,000 actors and stage managers, reacted with dismay to the news and urged New York and national politicians to rescue the arts sector.

“Today’s news should be an all hands-on-deck moment for Gov. (Mario) Cuomo, Mayor (Bill) De Blasio and Congress,” said Mary McColl, executive director. “The arts and entertainment sector drives the economy of New York, just like it does in cities and towns across the country. Decisions made in the days and weeks ahead will shape the future of the arts sector for years to come. Public officials at all levels must think much more boldly about supporting the arts or our entire economy will be slower to recover.”

Disney Theatrical gets no corporate subsidy from the Walt Disney Company and its stage shows must be financially self-sustaining.

Although an exact date for performances to resume on Broadway has yet to be determined, Broadway producers are now offering refunds and exchanges for tickets purchased for shows through Sept. 6.

Broadway performances were suspended on March 12 after Cuomo imposed a ban on gatherings of 500 or more people. There were 31 productions running, including eight new shows in previews and another eight shows in rehearsals preparing for the spring season.

Some shows like an upcoming revival of Neil Simon’s “Plaza Suite” starring Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker, as well as a musical about Michael Jackson, have pushed their production to next year.

Other shows scheduled to open this spring have abandoned their plans, including “Hangmen” and a revival of Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Amanda Kloots on Instagram wrote late Saturday that Cordero “made it out of surgery alive and is headed to his room to rest and recover.”

Cordero had been treated with blood thinners to help with clotting in his leg, but his doctors had to stop the treatment because it was causing internal bleeding.

“We took him off blood thinners but that again was going to cause some clotting in the right leg, so the right leg will be amputated today,” she said earlier Saturday.

Cordero entered the intensive care unit at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on March 31 and has been on a ventilator and unconscious after contracting COVID-19.

His wife has been sending him daily videos of her and their 10-month-old son, Elvis, so he could see them when he woke up, and urging friends and fans to join a daily sing-a-long. A GoFundMe fundraiser has raised over $200,000.

Cordero played a mob soldier with a flair for the dramatic in 2014 in Broadway’s Woody Allen 1994 film adaptation of “Bullets Over Broadway,” for which he received a Tony nomination for best featured actor in a musical. He moved to Los Angeles to star in “Rock of Ages.”

The lanky Cordero originated the menacing role of husband Earl opposite his estranged wife, played by Jessie Mueller, in “Waitress” on Broadway, as well as the role of Sonny in Chazz Palminteri’s “A Bronx Tale.”

On the small screen, Cordero appeared in several episodes of “Blue Bloods” and “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” as well as “Lilyhammer” and he had a role in the film “Going in Style.”

A crystal ball would come in handy.

To say the coronavirus crisis has thrown theaters big and small into unprecedented turmoil is an understatement. Every theater has been jolted by the mandated shutdown of all non-essential businesses.

Taking the hardest hit in the theater community (outside of creatives who’ve lost their jobs) are the storefront organizations, most operating on a shoestring budget with nowhere near the deeper pockets of larger theater companies.

The stay-at-home edict came as many Chicago theaters were ready to open new productions and others were about to begin rehearsals for shows slated to debut in late April or May.

Other plays, caught in the middle of a run, were canceled, with a handful able to offer online streaming for ticket holders.

Many theaters also had major spring fundraisers postponed, canceled or moved online.

Some welcome relief came with Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s announcement of the Arts for Illinois Relief Fund to provide financial assistance to artists, artisans and cultural organizations.

“We’re very grateful that so many people and organizations have come together to support the arts at this time,” said Leda Hoffmann, artistic direct of Strawdog Theatre, with an operating budget of $250,000. “There are still a lot of unknowns about the long-term effect of these closures on small organizations like us, but we know relief is needed now, and I’m glad we can get started.”

The League of Chicago Theatres says 93 of its 237 members have budgets of under $75,000 a year. At these smaller companies, one show’s revenue often helps pay for the next.

Strawdog’s staging of Brian James Polak’s “Welcome to Keene, New Hampshire” was set to begin April 17. Rehearsals were moved online, as was a fundraiser, but the show is postponed.

Hoffmann said it’s a scary time for storefront theaters, but she’s “grateful to have the flexibility of a smaller organization. Small theaters have always been able to find a way somehow. The finances are the big struggle, but the will is very much there.”

At Griffin Theatre, whose annual operating budget is around $400,000, the final two weekends of “Mlima’s Tale” (usually a show’s most lucrative dates) were canceled, as were two tours of the company’s highly successful children’s shows: “The Stinky Cheese Man” and “Frindle.” Artistic director Bill Massolia said the tours are a loss of $60,000 to $70,000.

Griffin has an online fundraising campaign going to raise money to pay the “Milma’s Tale” artists through the end of the run and finance the company through July.

“If we can just get through the summer, that will give us the breathing room to be able to figure out a strategy for the fall,” Massolia said. “This is all a little bit overwhelming.”

At Raven Theatre, which is also a rental house, artistic director Cody Estle said, “I’m wearing tracks into my wood floors because I keep pacing.”

Over the past few years, Raven, with an operating budget of $750,000, worked on making sure there were some reserves, Estle said. “But when I say reserves for a theater our size, it’s not very much. It could cover us for eight weeks or so.”

Broken Nose Theatre artistic director Elise Marie Davis said her biggest fear is that some companies won’t be able to bounce back. Broken Nose moved this season’s final show, Eric Reyes Loo’s “This Is Only a Test,” to next season. Davis said the company’s operating budget is “under six figures.”

“I think we’re going to see a very different theater scene moving forward,” she said. “My big fear is this will be a death sentence for some non-Equity theaters.”

How quickly will theatergoers, many of them older, return when the OK is given?

“Perhaps smaller spaces will be allowed to open firs,t” said League of Chicago Theatres executive director Deb Clapp. “Their audiences skew younger than some others, so maybe those audiences will be more willing to go back to the theater sooner. They may be in the best position for recovery. But, of course, that is all conjecture.”

Rivendell Theatre artistic director Tara Mallen said: “I am so encouraged by how much we have actually been able to accomplish online over these past three weeks — the play readings, the production meetings, the classes we have continued to teach. We are still working at Rivendell, still crafting stories that need to be shared and lifting up voices that need to be heard.”

J.B. Pritzker on Wednesday announced a new relief program to provide financial assistance to the city’s creative scene and cultural organizations impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.

The Arts for Illinois Relief Fund, which has raised about $4 million from the public and private sector, is a partnership between the city and the state, along with the local philanthropic community.

Through the relief fund, the city’s creatives — stage and production members and part-time cultural workers — can apply for one-time grants of $1,500 distributed by 3Arts, an organization that supports artists of color, disabled artists and women artists. Grants will be awarded through a lottery system and will be disseminated quickly, according to the official announcement.

Nonprofit arts and cultural organizations of any size will be able to apply for relief through the Arts Work Fund. Based on financial need, organizations will be awarded grants from $6,000 to $30,000.

The Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE) has contributed $1 million to the relief effort. Local charitable organizations such as the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Field Foundation and the Walder Foundation, have also made donations.

Fundraising efforts will be co-chaired by Illinois first lady M.K. Pritzker and Chicago first lady Amy Eshleman.

“Art has always been of incredible importance to me and to my family,” Pritzker said during his daily COVID-19 statewide press conference on Wednesday. “But of course so many of the usual ways of enjoying art together have had to be put on pause, and tragically, our creative communities have felt the financial hardship. [When] M.K., who has always put others front of mind in any hardship, told me that she had an idea to support art and artists in the fight against COVID-19, I was really excited to see what she would come up with. Honestly, she’s blown me away.”

The initiative has also launched artsforillinois.org, a website showcasing the work of Illinois creatives — artists, performers, singers, poets, painters and writers as well as dance and theater companies and museums — available for free viewing to the public.

“Artists live in relationship to their audience,” said DCASE commissioner Mark Kelly. “And for the audience to have disappeared in that visceral way of real life, it’s pretty shocking. And then on top of that, is just the economic devastation of lost jobs and lost income. In Chicago, without our music clubs, our theaters, our dance stages, without our films, poets, and painters, we’re not the great city that we live in every day.”

The financial impact of the pandemic on Illinois’ arts/creative community is staggering. According to survey by Arts Alliance Illinois, organizations closed under a statewide mandate are poised to lose more than $84 million in revenue; more than 24,124 individual events or performances have been canceled or postponed. A total of 3,563 full-time and 13,144 part-time/contract jobs have been impacted.

“This fund is so deeply appreciated,” said Amanda Williams, a Chicago-based visual artist who also spoke at Pritzker’s press conference on Wednesday. “To my fellow artists, I speak to you now. My hope is that this emergency fund can help you keep your lights on, or bridge you until the next cell phone bill is due, or to put food on your table.

Thirty-two companies responded to the survey, and that’s just a fraction of the state’s dance organizations. In Chicago alone, See Chicago Dance reports having more than 88 members, and at least 100 additional companies use its marketing resources.

Put simply, the state’s dance scene has taken a body blow. Indeed, industry leaders fear that some companies won’t recover from this crisis at all and others could come back in a weakened or reduced form.

“Not only the Joffrey, for all of us, it’s a precarious time,” said Ashley Wheater, artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet. “And the arts are so fragile as it is.”

Kevin Iega Jeff, co-founder and creative director of Deeply Rooted Dance Theater, believes his company can get by as long as the restrictions related to COVID-19 conclude by May. “If it goes beyond that, then we are starting to get into real trouble.”

One ray of hope could come Wednesday. State and city officials are expected to announce a relief fund for the Illinois cultural sector to be administered by the Arts Alliance. Funds would come from the City of Chicago and private and corporate donors.

In addition, the recently passed $2.2 trillion stimulus bill includes $75 million each for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for Humanities. These agencies will distribute 40 percent to state and regional arts agencies for re-granting, and the rest will go directly to applicant organizations nationwide.

Moreover, according to Americans for the Arts, qualifying arts organizations will be able to apply for other emergency help contained in the stimulus bill. Such aid includes $5 billion in community development block grants and $350 billion in emergency loans from the Small Business Administration.

“I do think if there is not a concentrated effort to support arts organizations through this, they will be missed,” said Vershawn Sanders-Ward, founder and artistic director of the Red Clay Dance Co. “People won’t really realize it until we’re on the other side of this and they see who is no longer there for their community.”

According to the Arts Alliance survey, nearly 2,500 dance performances and programs statewide have been affected by the COVID-19 shutdown. Here is a quick look at its impact on six Chicago companies:

Deeply Rooted Dance Theater (annual budget, $1.1 million) . The company, which marks its 25 th anniversary in 2021, expects to take a $700,000 hit. It announced March 25 that it was postponing “GOSHEN,” an ambitious new collaboration with Broadway in Chicago that was to include possible touring.

The company, which champions classical Indian dance, has been forced to cancel performances set for March, April and May. It hopes it won’t have to nix its annual summer dance camp, which earns the company $130,000, in late July.

The company, which champions classical Indian dance, has been forced to cancel performances set for March, April and May. It hopes it won’t have to nix its annual summer dance camp, which earns the company $130,000, in late July. Red Clay Dance Co. (annual budget $311,000). The company has had to eliminate its spring program, “Visions and Voices,” and its annual fundraiser, which annually nets as much as $10,000. If it cannot restart its programs by the end of June, it expects to take a $70,000 hit.

With all these cutbacks, dancers are hurt the most. Deeply Rooted, for example, has had to furlough its dozen dancers and is trying to find a way to give them at least some partial remuneration. Joffrey is keeping its 46 dancers on salary through April 3, then hopes to shift the remaining three to four weeks of their 40-week contract to the summer.

To get through this tough time, dance companies are falling back on cash reserves and slashing expenses. Ensemble Español is considering a GoFundMe campaign, and Red Clay plans to seek emergency help through on-line and texting fundraising platforms it already has.

At the same time, organizations are looking to their long-time supporters for supplemental assistance. Joffrey’s canceled spring fundraiser, Center Stage, has turned into what Wheater calls an “un-gala,” because many attendees are still giving the amounts they committed to the event.

Besides turning to the internet as a way to simply stay in touch with their audiences, some companies, such as the Natya Dance Theatre, are using Zoom and other on-line platforms as a way to keep classes going and maintain some revenue. But artistic director Hema Rajagopalan concedes it has been tough for many reasons, including students not having viable spaces to move at home.

Despite all these challenges, company leaders are trying to stay as positive as possible. Perez is already looking ahead to Ensemble Español’s upcoming 45th anniversary.

“We’ve got to continue to do that,” Perez said. “Move forward. Think ahead. I know this is a setback. It is a new normal that we’ve been hit with, but I think it is so important to keep the art form going.”

Blum, known for his work in movies like “Desperately Seeking Susan” and “Crocodile Dundee,” as well as a host of Broadway and off-Broadway theater productions and television works, was 69. He is survived by his wife, actress Janet Zarish.

Rebecca Damon, vice president of SAG-AFTRA, confirmed Blum’s death: ”It is with such deep sorrow that I’m writing to share the news that our friend and former board member Mark Blum has passed away as a result of complications from the coronavirus.”

News of Blum’s death follows the announcement Tuesday of the coronavirus-related death of Broadway playwright Terrence McNally.

Blum made his Broadway debut in 1977’s “The Merchant” and appeared in works ranging from “Lost in Yonkers” to both revivals of Gore Vidal’s “The Best Man.”

His last appearance on the Great White Way was in 2013’s “The Assembled Parties.”

An actor to the end, his last off-Broadway appearance was in September’s “Fern Hill.”

On the silver screen, he was known for “Crocodile Dundee,” “Desperately Seeking Susan” and “Shattered Glass,” and was a staple on television, including a recent role in the thriller “You” as bookshop owner Mr. Moody. He also was featured on “Fraiser,” Hulu’s ”Mozart in the Jungle” and HBO’s “The Sopranos,” among many others.

Outpourings of love peppered social media Thursday morning as news of Blum’s death spread.

Playwrights Horizons announced his death on Twitter, saying, “With love and heavy hearts, Playwrights Horizons pays tribute to Mark Blum, a dear longtime friend and a consummate artist who passed this week. Thank you, Mark, for all you brought to our theater, and to theaters and audiences across the world. We will miss you.”

Damon’s tribute to Blum continued: “Mark was a dedicated Screen Actors Guild and SAG-AFTRA board member serving from 2007-2013, a passionate champion for merger, and a tireless advocate for members. Those of us lucky enough to have known him will treasure our memories of a gifted actor, a master teacher, a loyal friend and a beautiful human.

“On a personal note — I always appreciated Mark’s clear perception of complex situations. He always spoke the truth and did a great service in informing members of our community about the ins and outs of the union whenever he had the opportunity.

“Mark was smart, funny, and a true actor’s actor. He will be deeply missed. Thinking of you all. Please #stayhome. #COVID19”

Actress Judith Light tweeted, “Mark Blum, so generous, so kind, so humble, so talented. Our time together in the play ‘The Assembled Parties’ at MTC was a true joy. May he rest in peace knowing that he transformed the lives of so many and was cherished by so many; me among them.”

Actor Josh Radnor said, “When I was in drama school Mark Blum was exactly the kind of actor I aspired to be: constantly employed, deeply respected, total mensch. Gutted to hear of his passing. His wife Janet Zarish was my acting teacher at NYU. They were the loveliest couple. My heart breaks for her.”

Playwright Heidi Schreck wrote, “Oh this is devastating. The brilliant and generous Mark Blum was such a life giving force in New York theater. We will miss you dearly.”

Valour! Compassion!” and “Master Class” and the musicals “Ragtime” and “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” has died of complications from the coronavirus. He was 81.

McNally died Tuesday at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Sarasota, Florida, according to representative Matt Polk. McNally was a lung cancer survivor who lived with chronic inflammatory lung disease.

His plays and musicals explored how people connect — or fail to. With wit and thoughtfulness, he tackled the strains in families, war, and relationships and probed the spark and costs of creativity. He was an openly gay writer who wrote about homophobia, love and AIDS.

“I like to work with people who are a lot more talented and smarter than me, who make fewer mistakes than I do, and who can call me out when I do something lazy,” he told LA Stage Times in 2013. “A lot of people stop learning in life, and that’s their tragedy.”

McNally’s “Lips Together, Teeth Apart,” about two married couples who spend a weekend on Fire Island, was a landmark play about AIDS. His play “The Ritz” became one of the first plays with unapologetic gay characters to reach a mainstream audience.

McNally also explored gay themes in the book for the musical “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” for which he won his first Tony Award. His play “Love! Valour! Compassion!” earned him another Tony Award for its portrayal of eight gay men facing issues of fidelity, love and happiness.

“Theater changes hearts, that secret place where we all truly live,” he said at the 2019 Tony Awards, where he accepted a lifetime achievement award. “The world needs artists more than ever to remind us what truth and beauty and kindness really are.”

F. Murray Abraham, the Oscar-winner who appeared on Broadway in “The Ritz” said of McNally: “His plays are a pleasure to do, but what he says is important, too. And he’s like a fountain he keeps on writing and writing and writing.”

Tributes pored in online from Broadway figures, including from fellow playwrights Paula Vogel, who called McNally “the soul of kindness” and Lin-Manuel Miranda, who called McNally “a giant in our world, who straddled plays and musicals deftly.” Actor Conrad Ricamora described McNally as “the most kind, brilliant person to work with” and talk show host James Corden tweeted: “He was an absolute gentleman and his commitment to the theater was unwavering. He will be missed by so many of us.”

Composer Tom Kitt, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for “Next to Normal,” told The Associated Press he considers McNally “irreplaceable.”

“Terrence was an extraordinary man and a brilliant artist,” Kitt said. “He’s a true giant in our art form, and he will be missed and we are lucky that we had him and had his art for as long as we did.”

In 2018 McNally was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He won four Tonys and an Emmy. New York University gave him an honorary doctorate in 2019.

Andrew D. Hamilton, president of New York University, told the crowd that day that McNally put a “unique stamp on American drama by probing the urgent need for connection that resonates at the core of human experience.”

Some of his Broadway musical adaptations include “The Full Monty,” adapted from the British film and scored by David Yazbek; “Catch Me if You Can,” based on the Steven Spielberg film, and scored by composer Marc Shaiman and lyricist Scott Wittman; and “Ragtime,” the musical based on the novel by E.L. Doctorow, which won four Tony Awards. In 2017, his musical reworking of the film “Anastasia” landed on Broadway.

His 2014 Broadway play “Mothers and Sons” — revisiting McNally’s 1990 TV movie “Andre’s Mother,” which won him an Emmy Award — explores the relationship between a mother and her dead son’s former gay partner. His “It’s Only a Play” was a valentine to theater-making. His “The Visit” was a meditation on revenge.

Many of his works were also presented on Chicago’s theater stages.

“Terrence McNally was a ground-breaking playwright who broke new ground with plays such as ‘The Ritz,’ ‘Kiss of the Spider Woman’ and “Lips Together, Teeth Apart, that dealt with issues in the gay community in a way few other playwrights had managed to do at that time. At the same time, he was able to create works such as the script to “Ragtime” that covered the entire panoply of an historic era. His energy and creativity will be missed, but his five decades of writing have left the world of theater a forever better place,” said First Folio artistic director David Rice.

“My heart goes out to his husband Tom at this impossible moment. Terrence was writing about being gay and the AIDS crisis at a moment in time when we desperately needed the authenticity of his voice and he opened a door for us in the hearts of audiences everywhere. We owe him an enormous debt of gratitude,” said Writers Theatre artistic director Michael Halberstam.

“Terrence McNally’s untimely passing has robbed the American theater of one of its most passionate and productive artists — and, for those of us who had the pleasure of working with and knowing him, a true friend and mentor,” said Goodman Theater artistic associate Steve Scott, who worked with McNally on the Chicago company’s world premiere of “The Visit” and various other projects. “Terrence was equally at home in the worlds of stage drama, comedy, musical theater and opera ... but his most notable (and heartfelt) accomplishment was a series of plays which gave voice to the gay community and its members, chronicling its emergence from the shadows in the 1970s, encapsulating the tragedies and triumphs of the AIDS pandemic, and leading the way to 21st century social revolution and acceptance.”

McNally was born in St. Petersburg, Florida, and grew up in Corpus Christi, Texas, listening to radio broadcasts of “The Green Hornet” and the Metropolitan Opera. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Columbia University in 1960 with a degree in English.

McNally was at the Actors Studio when he was hired by novelist John Steinbeck to be a tutor and guardian to his sons. One of McNally’s earliest theater attempts was writing the book for a musical adaptation of Steinbeck’s “East of Eden” which was called “Here’s Where I Belong” and lasted only a single performance on Broadway in 1968.

McNally’s first Broadway play “And Things That Go Bump in the Night” didn’t fare much better in 1965. His absurdist, symbolic melodrama about good and evil confounded critics. Newsday called it “ugly, perverted, tasteless.” It closed in less than three weeks. He was 24.

He rebounded with the 1969 off-Broadway hit “Next,” a two-character comedy about a reluctant draftee reporting for an Army physical. A string of successes followed, including “Where Has Tommy Flowers Gone?” (1971), “The Tubs” (1974), “Bad Habits” (1974) and “The Ritz” (1975), a farce set in a gay bathhouse that ran more than a year on Broadway and became McNally’s first produced screenplay.

His breakout, “Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune,” about a romance between a waitress and short order cook, was later adapted into a film starring Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer. It was revived on Broadway in 2019 starring Audra McDonald. Chicago’s Steppenwolf Theatre company staged a critically acclaimed version in 2004, starring Laurie Metcalf and Yasen Peyankov.

He collaborated three times with legendary composer John Kander and lyricist Freb Ebb — on “The Rink,” “Kiss of the Spider Woman” and “The Visit.” Chita Rivera starred in all three.

His love of opera informed his works “Golden Age,” “The Lisbon Traviata” and “Master Class,” which explored the life of opera diva Maria Callas. He also contributed to opera as a librettist — “The Food of Love” in 1999 with music by Robert Beaser, “Dead Man Walking” in 2000 with music by Jake Heggie, and 2015’s “Great Scott” with Heggie.

McNally sometimes was controversial, especially with his play “Corpus Christi,” which depicts a modern-day Jesus as a homosexual. The Manhattan Theater Club, the first company to consider staging it, received death threats and temporarily canceled the production before enjoying a successful run.

When picking up his “Ragtime” Tony Award, McNally thanked the theater community for its outcry. “You came together when I was in trouble. It was a time of oppression. You came together overnight. Our voices were heard, and we won.” Holding his Tony high, he said, “So this is for freedom. Thank you.”

“Terrence McNally has been and will always be a beacon in our theater and the LGBTQIA+ communities,” said Chay Yew, artistic director of Chicago’s Victory Gardens Theater. “His body of work has shone an immense light on our lives, allowing us and others to see ourselves, with humor, with heart, with humanity, especially when we needed it most during the AIDS epidemic. I know I did. He will always live on in many of artists and people he has inspired.”

McNally and his partner, Thomas Kirdahy, married in Vermont in 2003, and again in Washington, D.C., in 2010.

A prominent member of the Belmont Theatre District wants to keep the shows going — and make sure the cast and crew is compensated.

While Theatre Wit, 1229 W. Belmont Ave. in the Lake View neighborhood, has suspended all in-person seating for its shows, the creative team behind “Teenage Dick” is ready to unveil “remote viewing” for the reimagining of Richard III, the disabled main character from William Shakespeare’s play.

Remote viewing starts Wednesday. Here’s how it works:

Viewers buy a ticket for their desired date and time — same as always.

Viewers receive an email with a private, personalized URL and password to watch a recorded performance on Vimeo at the specified date and time. The recording, shot Monday, was edited to provide close-ups and full coverage of the staging.

There are only 98 viewing streams — the same number as Theater Wit’s capacity— available for every performance.

At the end of every performance, viewers are invited to join the cast and fellow audience members for a live post-show discussion over video conference.

The show, which can be viewed on a computer, smartphone or tablet, could be seen as a refuge from the dire situation for theater companies, many of which are asking ticketed consumers to donate the price of their tickets rather than ask for a full refund.

Director Mike Lew’s play portrays Dick, a class president candidate with cerebral palsy, maneuvering the brutal politics of high school. Remote viewer tickets are $28.

Theater Wit’s original response to the coronavirus scare was to continue live performances of “Teenage Dick” but limit seating and also sell tickets to watch a live stream remotely. That was before Gov. J.B. Pritzker ordered all bars and restaurants to close to the public at end of business day on Monday.

“After the governor’s announcement, if you can’t gather in a bar or restaurant, you can’t gather in a theater; he didn’t say ‘theater’ but I can read the spirit of it,” said Jeremy Wechsler, Theater Wit’s artistic director. “You can see what’s happened in other countries. ... We were supposed to open, you are concerned that people aren’t gonna get to see the work.”

Next, Wechsler, who described ticket sales as “not bad,” put together a plan looping in the actors and their union, with something that would be fair to the well-being of the actors.

He hopes the play can be viewed as a potential national model for theater companies who hope to continue on during the pandemic.

“We’ve already reduced the amount of physical contact between actors, as much as the script allows,” Wechsler said. “After today [Monday], I think there’s a real ethical concern about gathering a group of technicians and actors together in one space, you know. We’re going to go into social isolation here, so I don’t know how many theaters you are able to get to do this.

When the theaters are allowed to reopen, Teenage Dick’s cast will return to perform the show live and in-person, theater officials said. And, more important, the cast/crew will be paid the full performance rates for the duration of the run.

Monday’s performance that took place in front of a private audience of 40, was for social distancing, according to theater officials.

Theater Wit isn’t the only local theater house that’s experimenting with unorthodox practices. Annoyance Theatre has created a GoFundMe account called a “Countdown to Quarantine” to raise funds to live-stream a show that highlights how nine people, locked inside the theater at 851 W. Belmont, interact while being quarantined during a pandemic. The 10-day process will culminate in a live-streamed original show directed by artistic director Mick Napier.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Thursday banned gatherings of 500 or more in the city, effectively forcing the hand of Broadway producers who had previously said that Broadway would be “open for business” unless advised not to by the government.

Shows will resume the week of April 13, only 10 days before the official cut-off for eligibility for the Tony Awards. Cuomo said venues of under 500 can only be filled to half their capacity.

On Broadway, would-be theater attendees were turned away, some shaking their heads in disbelief. “I had been hoping to catch one but it’s all canceled,” said Quinn Heath, 24, who was visiting from Boston.

Closing all Broadway theaters for a month is unprecedented, said Laurence Maslon, an arts professor at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts. “Nothing comes close to this amount of time ever.”

The move comes a day after Broadway’s two largest theater chains revealed that a part-time usher and security guard who worked at two theaters in recent days tested positive for COVID-19 and was under quarantine.

The pressure on Broadway to go dark steadily increased as other entertainment hubs shuttered, including Carnegie Hall, the Metropolitan Opera, the NBA, NHL, CinemaCon, Coachella and Major League Soccer.

Actors took to Twitter to share their sadness. “My heart is with all my friends and colleagues,” wrote Tony Award-nominee Judy Kuhn. “This is really bad for everyone who depends on the theater for their livelihoods.” Kerry Butler, a Tony-nominated star of “Beetlejuice,” said the shuttering ”is the right move to keep everyone safe.”

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.

Other theaters far from Broadway have closed their doors, including the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in California, which canceled or postponed all productions and programs through March 31. The 5th Avenue Theatre in Seattle closed its doors, citing the state’s mandated cancellation of public gatherings. The 1,600-seat Curran Theater in San Francisco decided to scrap performances of “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.”

Broadway producers were cautious until now, with a wait-and-see approach for an industry that grossed $1.8 billion last season. The Broadway League, a trade organization representing producers and theater owners, recommended that actors refrain from greeting fans at the stage door.

The league said it had increased the frequency of cleaning and disinfecting all public and backstage areas. It also added alcohol-based sanitizer dispensers for public use in the lobby of every theater.

Producers have been historically unwilling to cancel shows, which had an average paid admission last week of over $100. The last time they did so was in 2016, when a ban on travel in New York and the suspension of public transportation due to snow forced theater owners to cancel one day’s shows. Superstorm Sandy in 2012 darkened Broadway for four days and cost more than $8.5 million in lost revenue. Broadway theaters stayed open during the 1918 influenza epidemic.

Broadway is particularly vulnerable to the new coronavirus because its audience skews older, thousands of people are packed into small seats for every show and the industry is dependent on tourism. Of the 14.8 million admissions in the 2018-2019 season, 65% were made by tourists — 46% from Americans outside New York and 19% from other countries.

Actors’ Equity Association, which represents more than 51,000 actors and stage managers nationwide, had urged officials and producers to consider the health and economic welfare of theater workers in their decision.

The shuttering of all 41 Broadway theaters will cause chaos to the spring theatrical calendar, which culminates in the Tony Awards on May 19. Several shows — including “Company,” “Caroline, Or Change,” “Diana” and “Mrs. Doubtfire” — had scheduled to open during the time when theaters are closed.

Maslon noted that many of the spring’s biggest shows were waiting to open and he saw no reason why the Broadway League wouldn’t adjust its eligibility date. “I think they have to extend the season,” he said.

Established shows will likely weather the storm better than one’s waiting to open. “If it’s ‘Lion King,’ they’ll just pick up where they left off.

One of those that’s managed to stay open is The Jibarito Stop, a popular lunch and dinner spot on 18th Street in Pilsen.

But as COVID-19 ravages meat processing plants across the country, leading to shortages, the Puerto Rican restaurant will close its doors for an indefinite period of time starting Wednesday as prices for some cuts have skyrocketed.

“We usually get around 600 pounds of inside round steak a week for around $3 a pound, but now it’s at $6 a pound,” said Cely Rodriguez, who opened The Jibarito Stop with her business partner Moraima Fuentes in 2015.

“We’ve managed to stay open this long and thankfully so far business has been good, but at this rate, we would start losing money if we didn’t close.”

Meatpacking workers hit hard

The squeeze felt by The Jibarito Stop and other restaurants, experts said, is directly tied to large coronavirus outbreaks at meatpacking plants nationwide.

More than 4,900 workers at the facilities have contracted COVID-19, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released Friday. At least 20 have died.

Those infections have added to the disproportionate burden facing black and Latino working-class communities during the pandemic as approximately 70% of meatpacking workers are either black or Latino, according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a think-tank based in Washington, D.C.

Immigrants have also been hard hit as they represent 52% of frontline meatpacking workers despite making up 17% of the total U.S. workforce. Nearly half of frontline meatpacking workers live in low-income families, while one in eight have income below the poverty line.

The CDC said meatpacking plants became hotspots for the virus because they have difficulties maintaining physical distance among employees. Another factor cited is that many meatpacking workers live in crowded households and often carpool to work.

Despite the high infection rates, some plants that were forced to close have now reopened at limited capacity in the wake of an executive order from President Donald Trump.

Shortages here to stay

Still, the nation’s meat supply is “down across the board,” said Sarah Little, a spokeswoman for the North American Meat Institute, an industry trade group, “so the next couple of weeks we should see how the system works. It’s never been tested like this before.”

Sam Toia, president of the Illinois Restaurant Association, an industry group, said the meat shortage will be a reality for the foreseeable future.

“It’s going to get worse before it gets better,” he said, “so restaurateurs should try and buy the meat that they can right now.”

That strategy might work for restaurants that can buy and store meat in bulk, but small joints like The Jibarito Stop are caught between buying whatever meat is available — at whatever price — and potentially charging customers more to make up the difference.

“Right now, steak is our most popular item, and the cut we usually buy is either unavailable or too expensive,” Fuentes said. “And what is available is frozen, and we can’t use that because we don’t have a walk-in cooler. It’s important to have our meat fresh — that’s the only way we can make it work.”

While the meat shortage is the main factor behind The Jibarito Stop’s temporary closure, Fuentes said the pandemic has cut into her bottom line in other ways, too.

“The price for sanitation products like masks and gloves has gone up by a lot [and] third-party delivery vendors like Grubhub and Uber Eats sometimes take up to 30 percent of a sale [or more] and that’s really all we got coming in right now,” she said.

Rodriguez said the restaurant doesn’t have the wherewithal to pay its handful of employees while it’s closed, but she hopes that shutting down for now will help ensure they have a job to come back to.

“Our margins were already so small, and now they’ve basically disappeared,” she said. “It was a tough decision to close, but we want to be here for our employees for when we finally have a chance to fully open up.”

The giant coronavirus stimulus legislation signed into law Friday provides federal money for the state to provide extra and extended unemployment benefits.

The Department of Employment Security has not yet revised its website to reflect how newly eligible people can apply for the new federally funded assistance, with state officials still working out the details.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker said at a briefing Saturday a “deluge” of applications for unemployment continue to flood the department.

Under the new federal law, funding will flow to states to help cover gig workers newly eligible for unemployment compensation; 13 weeks of extra payments will be added to the 26 already allowed and, according to Section 2104 of the legislation, there will also be an “emergency increase in unemployment compensation” of “an additional $600 per week payment to each recipient of unemployment insurance or Pandemic Unemployment Assistance for up to four months. “

Tens of thousands of workers across Illinois have been temporarily out of work since the outbreak began forcing businesses to close. Last week, Pritzker ordered all bars and restaurants to stop serving dine-in customers, and on Saturday, he issued a stay-at-home order leaving just “essential” businesses in operation.

The result is countless people are now out of work and being forced into the state’s unemployment system. Illinois alone saw more than 64,000 new claims for unemployment benefits from March 16-18, and an unprecedented 130,000-plus claims so far this month, officials said.

To handle this massive influx of new applications, IDES announced it recently adopted emergency rules for who qualifies for unemployment insurance.

Unemployment insurance (UI) basics

In normal times, UI provides temporary income via federal funds to Illinois residents who are unemployed but able, available and actively seeking work each week.

The amount residents can receive depends on their usual pay rate with benefits ranging from $51 to $580 per week. Those approved can receive up to 26 weeks of benefits in a 12-month period.

The new emergency rules adopted during the coronavirus pandemic open up UI to a much larger group of workers. This means many people who wouldn’t typically qualify for UI can get benefits during the state of emergency.

Additionally, under the federal relief bill passed last week, Illinois residents receiving unemployment benefits will receive an additional $600 weekly above what they would receive in regular unemployment benefits until July 31, 2020.

Workers temporarily laid off due to COVID-19 can get UI

Illinois residents who are temporarily out of work because their employer has closed due to the coronavirus can qualify for UI if they meet all the other basic requirements.

The state isn’t expecting anyone to go out looking for a new job during a stay-at-home order: as long as applicants are prepared to return to their job as soon as the employer reopens, they’ll be considered to be actively seeking work and will qualify.

Under emergency rules, these workers will not have to register with the employment service.

Workers who quit due to COVID-19 fears cannot get UI

Unlike Illinois residents who are temporarily laid off by their employers’ closure, workers who voluntarily leave their job over concerns of the coronavirus will not be eligible for UI. The agency says “an individual generally has a duty to make a reasonable effort to work with his or her employer to resolve whatever issues have caused the individual to consider quitting.”

Parents who leave work due to a child’s school closure can get UI

With all Illinois schools closed through at least the end of April, and possibly the remainder of the school year, parents who voluntarily leave work to care for their child can qualify for UI because they “could be considered as unemployed through no fault of” their own.

You must still meet all of the other standard requirements, and unlike workers temporarily laid off due to COVID-19, parents who voluntarily leave work must be registered with the employment service.

Anyone who’s already exhausted UI rights may be eligible for additional benefits

With the passing of the federal relief bill in Congress last week, IDES announced Tuesday that some individuals who have already received their full 26 weeks of regular unemployment benefits in the last one-year period will be eligible for additional benefits during the crisis.

“If you have exhausted your benefits, or you are close to exhausting your benefits, we are finalizing the process to continue benefits under the stimulus package,” IDES said in a Q-and-A posted on its website. The agency says more information will be issued once guidance is provided by the U.S. Department of Labor.

Here’s how to apply for UI

You can call the Illinois Department of Economic Services at (800) 244-5631 or 866-488-4016 (TTY), but users are urged to file claims via the IDES website. And do not go in person: as of March 19, IDES offices are closed to the public until further notice.

To accommodate the massive surge of applicants, the agency has staggered times for people to submit claims:

People whose last names start with the letters A through M are asked to file claims online on Sundays, Tuesdays or Thursdays.

Last names beginning with N through Z should file claims on Mondays, Wednesdays or Fridays.

Saturdays are set aside for people who aren’t able to file during their allotted time, officials said.

People without internet access should call in according to the following schedule, per IDES:",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Should he work?

With events canceled left and right, restaurant and bar workers furloughed and people avoiding unnecessary travel, workers from stand-up comics to wedding planners to housekeepers are finding themselves suddenly unemployed. And those who haven’t been told to stay home say they are being left with the choice between earning a paycheck and doing their part to promote social distancing and stop the spread of the virus.

“If I got someone sick, I would feel terrible,” Sanchez, a driver for Uber and Lyft, said from his home Wednesday, where he is in quarantine and waiting the result of his COVID-19 test, which he took after he realized he was exposed to someone who is infected.

As a founder of Gig Workers Matter, a group that organizes and advocates for gig workers, he said coronavirus has shined a light on the struggles faced by workers with no company support services to fall back on, no healthcare and limited savings.

“It shows how much we need something throughout the year, not just during a pandemic,” said Sanchez, 40.

Another rideshare driver, Marion Dollar, 50, said she decided to stop driving for two weeks to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. She said she can’t last more than a month without a paycheck.

“It’s very important to social distance,” Dollar said of her decision to stay inside at her Pilsen home. “We all have to work together for the benefit of everyone right now.”

That said, the Airbnb host has also seen her home bookings drop off a cliff since coronavirus exploded across the county.

“At least I have some savings. Those people who are working now, they probably have no other choice,” Dollar said.

Other rideshare drivers who spoke with the Sun-Times said they’ve seen their earnings plummet as events are canceled, bars are closed and airports have slowed to a crawl.

When those industries close, the effect on the wages of workers who support them are felt far and wide.

Alydar Skyy, a 30-year-old bartender and stand-up comic from Arlington Heights, said she’s effectively unemployed coming out of the already slow months of January and February.

Not only have her shifts been suspended, her stand-up gigs are canceled, too.

“I would have made about $400 this weekend,” she said of her comedy work.

Unplanned events

Shar Pazand, owner of Citygirl Events, said event planners, in addition to suffering huge losses from cancellations, have a daunting number of balls in the air as countless events are postponed or rescheduled.

A postponed wedding, for example, can impact up to 15 different vendors, from hotels to caterers to transportation companies to DJs. If an event is rescheduled, there is no guarantee the original vendors will be available. The uncertainty is the hardest part, she said.

“What this has proven to me is that we are all so connected,” Pazand said. For better or for worse, “we are all in this together.”

Temp worker can’t get unemployment

Canceled events have led to layoffs in workers in a host of jobs. Maria Morales, a mother of six who lives in Gage Park, was let go last week from her job with a cleaning crew at McCormick Place, when her boss called to say since no events were scheduled, there was no work for her.

Morales said she is not eligible for unemployment insurance, since her company pays her as a temporary worker.

“They told us we might not get work again until June,” she said from home Wednesday.

Her husband works mostly during the warmer months as a construction contractor. Morales recently got approved for food assistance, which was her biggest worry.

“Rent, yes. Bills, yes. But feeding my children” is her biggest worry, she said. “We’re living a decent life, but it’s hard for us. People need to put on our shoes and see how we struggle.”

Morales said any additional federal or state assistance would be a huge help to her and her family.

“They’re going to bail out the airlines, but what about us?” she wondered.

No homes to clean

Meanwhile, despite all the “deep cleaning” taking places at many businesses and other spaces, domestic workers who clean houses and apartments are actually seeing their work dry up as residents become fearful of letting outsiders into their homes.

Lety Tellez, an organizer with the Latino Union of Chicago, a nonprofit based in Albany Park, said the nearly 100 domestic workers — most of whom are immigrant women with children — in her group are “being left without work.”

Cecilia Garcia said she had four houses penciled in for this week, but they’ve all canceled.

“I have three for next week too, but I think those are going to get canceled, too,” she said of the jobs, which pay $100-$150 each.

Garcia’s husband, an auto mechanic, is also out of work.

“Everything’s paralyzed,” she said. “We can’t pay the bills if we’re not working.”

Multiple jobs, all impacted

Carolina Sanchez, like many workers interviewed by the Sun-Times, has two jobs to make ends meet. But what makes this situation so difficult is both of her sources of income are seriously threatened by the pandemic.

Sanchez, 28, works part-time at a vintage clothing store in Pilsen that has seen its business drop dramatically. She’s also a professional photographer, but her 15 photoshoots in March and April have all been canceled.

“My main concern right now is being safe, but if the store closes or if nothing happens with photography, I will most likely end up moving back in with my parents in Michigan,” she said.

Finding other ways to make money

Other impacted workers say they have been forced to find ways to recoup lost income or remodel their businesses to remain active.

David Rothstein, a bandleader who performs at corporate events and weddings, said many of his gigs have been canceled or postponed.

“We’ve lost some corporate events which many times don’t reschedule,” he said. “As time goes on and we get deeper into wedding season, then it starts to get even more challenging. It’s had a huge impact.”

He added: “It’s not one random wedding where the couple broke up. It’s affecting everything.”

To make up for lost income, some musicians he knows have started teaching music lessons using online video services. His own company is developing an option for video streaming services so that older family members who are more susceptible to coronavirus can still experience a wedding or event from a remote location.

“They only ones that are going to survive this are the ones who are going to adapt,” he said.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Weedmaps, which supplies several cannabis dispensaries across Illinois (including Chicago, has created “Higher Together: Sessions from Home,” where notable musicians, DJs, comedians and other influencers perform exclusive sets from their homes and debut new content via live stream.

Their plan is to celebrate 4/20 — the unofficial holiday for cannabis consumers — in all four U.S. continental time zones at 4:20 p.m. Monday.

Wiz Khalifa, Billy Ray Cyrus, Ari Lennox, Joey “CoCo” Diaz, Berner, Stephen Marley, Cam’ron, The Alchemist and others are among the creatives who are scheduled to participate in what Weedmaps calls the “world’s biggest 4/20 virtual celebration.”

Cyrus plans to debut his new single “Hillbilly Ray,” along with an accompanying animated music video, as part of his exclusive acoustic set.

“For more than 12 years, Weedmaps has connected millions of consumers with retailers and brands, while advocating for accessible cannabis for all,” Juanjo Feijoo, Weedmaps’ CEO said in a statement. “We’re excited to partner with some of the best in music and entertainment to celebrate the plant and the culture with our community.”

While the virtual concert has a celebration aspect, the event is also a means to raise funds for Weedmaps’ event partner, The Last Prisoner Project, a Denver-based coalition of cannabis industry leaders that aims to bring restorative justice to the cannabis industry and those jailed for marijuana offenses — especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Our constituents, many of whom are over the age of 60 and have underlying health conditions, are ‘imprisoned’ because of a plant that has now been deemed an ‘essential’ service by jurisdictions across the country,” said Sarah Gersten, Last Prisoner Project’s executive director and general counsel in a statement. “Releasing cannabis prisoners now is not only the right thing to do from a justice perspective, but also to ensure the health and safety of all of us.”

It was supposed to be a long weekend of festivals and music culminating on April 20, or 4/20, the code for marijuana’s high holiday. Instead, it has been reduced to an online replica because of stay-at-home orders to curb the pandemic.

Get the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.

Virtual parties and video chats are replacing vast outdoor smoking sessions to mark the rise of legalization and celebrate cannabis culture. The origins of the annual celebration are believed tied to a group of Northern California high school friends, who used the code as slang for smoking pot in the early 1970s.

“Stay home,” the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML, said bluntly. San Francisco Mayor London Breed threatened arrests: “We will not tolerate anyone coming to San Francisco for 4/20 this year.”

For businesses, 4/20 is usually their once-a-year Black Friday, when sales soar. Instead, they are reporting up-and-down buying and pondering an uncertain future.

The pandemic means the world economy could face its worst year since the Great Depression in the 1930s. In a sign of what’s to come, U.S. retail sales overall dropped nearly 9% in March — a record. Millions are out of work.

As for the holiday, “there’s a somber feeling to this one,” said Jordan Lams, CEO of Pure CA, which specializes in marijuana extracts and does business as Moxie brand products. Before the outbreak, “it was going to be the biggest 4/20 in history,” Lams said.

Steve White, CEO of Arizona-based Harvest Health & Recreation, said he’s watching to see if consumers treat marijuana more like beer or toilet paper when money runs short.

When the economy tumbles, beer sales traditionally spike. With toilet paper, panic-buying might empty shelves but people do not use more of it. They just buy less later.

It will be a telling year, because no one in the relatively new industry knows if sales will plunge, stay flat or even rise.

“Do people buy less cannabis, or does it become more ingrained as part of their daily life?” White said.

The uncertainty in the market poses the latest challenge for an industry that’s expanded in some form to all but a handful of states.

The risks are spotlighted in California, where businesses contend with hefty taxes, an illicit market that still dwarfs the legal one and a tourism-reliant economy that’s crippled by virus restrictions.

Because cannabis remains illegal at the federal level, most banks don’t want to do business with pot companies and they aren’t included in the coronavirus rescue package that will help other businesses.

Before the virus, “we were already teetering on ... an edge of a cannabis collapse,” said Los Angeles dispensary owner Jerred Kiloh, who heads the United Cannabis Business Association. “It’s going to be very difficult for cannabis businesses to make it through this pandemic.”

That’s despite the onset of stay-at-home orders in March that sent marijuana sales rocketing; some businesses reported single-day records as customers stocked up. New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles were among the cities that labeled dispensaries essential businesses that could remain open.

But since then, business generally has flattened or tapered off, even with deliveries and curbside pickups growing to reduce health risks. Marijuana data trackers BDS Analytics documented sales surges through much of March, but then consumers pulled back in late March and early April, with sales mostly below average.

In Oregon, cannabis retailers saw a huge spike last month — a 30% increase in average sales per retailer compared with March 2019. Sales increases mid-month were even larger.

However, the peak has leveled off and customers are coming in less frequently but buying more, said David Alport, who owns two Bridge City Collective stores in Portland. He’s hired three more employees to handle home deliveries.

In Illinois, marijuana businesses can keep operating under Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order. Companies made sweeping changes that included appointment-only sales and online ordering.

The Mission dispensary on Chicago’s South Side saw an initial spike in purchases before the lockdown took effect, but that’s leveled off.

“We’ve never faced an economic downturn when cannabis was legal,” said Kris Krane, president of Mission dispensaries. “This is completely unprecedented.”

Some customers could be especially vulnerable during an economic downturn. Among cannabis users in states where its legal, 32% have incomes below $35,000 and only 54% have full-time employment, according to BDS Analytics. Anyone on a tight budget might be more apt to avoid taxes that go with legal purchases and buy from illicit market dealers.

Steve DeAngelo, co-founder of Harborside dispensaries in California, said it’s difficult to predict what’s next, with no template for how cannabis consumers will react in a deep economic downturn.

Still, he notes that the industry has endured for years through times good and bad, even when consumers had only one option — illegal purchases. Consumers who see marijuana as part of their daily routine will keep coming back, he predicted.

But, for businesses, there will be a “sorting out,” DeAngelo said. Companies with strong brands and cash reserves are likely to fare better in a poor economy; those saddled with heavy debt who made too-rosy promises to investors will face challenges.

“There is not going to be an extinction moment,” DeAngelo said. “It’s going to prove more resilient than many, many other industries.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Coming just over three months after pot was legalized for recreational use, 4/20 offered an opportunity for the state’s residents to publicly embrace cannabis and its colorful subculture, which has swiftly shifted from the underground to Main Street.

But as the number of COVID-19 cases continued to rise late last month, Gov. J.B. Pritzker effectively put the kibosh on any 4/20 parties when he extended a statewide stay-at-home order until May that prohibits large gatherings.

Dispensary 33 has since announced that the third annual Waldo’s Forever Fest, a huge, bud-friendly bash slated to take place Saturday outside the pot shop at Clark and Division, will now be held online using the Twitch app. The physical event has tentatively been rescheduled for Sept. 26.

“This 4/20 was going to be on a whole ‘nother level. We were super excited to blow it out with the street festival. I think we were going to have twice the size of out footprint last year,” Dispensary 33 spokeswoman Abigail Watkins said of the event, which drew thousands last year.

Consumption allowed — at home

Watkins said the socially distanced shindig, scheduled to start at 4:20 p.m. on Saturday, looks to “showcase different personalities and different people’s talents in the cannabis community all throughout Chicago.” The bill features a live-stream of local DJs and glass blowers, as well as stony Chicago sibling rockers White Mystery and drag performers Lucy Stoole and Shea Coulee, a finalist on “RuPaul’s Drag Race.”

“I still think it’ll be fun and we’ll still be able to connect people through cannabis and celebrate,” said Watkins. “Also people are going to be able to smoke at home and actually celebrate 4/20 with consumption, which there wasn’t going to be consumption on-site at the fest” — since public consumption remains illegal.

With much of the country ordered to stay home, similar virtual events offer pot users a way to observe the “high” holiday from their living rooms. One celebration scheduled for Monday and dubbed Higher Together features a DJ set and smoke session with rapper and reefer enthusiast Wiz Khalifa and a performance by Billy Ray Cyrus.

All proceeds from a donation drive will go to the Last Prisoner Project, a nonprofit that seeks to address the harms of cannabis prohibition and is circulating a petition to urge President Donald Trump and the Federal Bureau of Prisons “to take the necessary steps to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus on our incarcerated communities.”

2nd pot event moves online

Meanwhile, Monday’s second annual Chicago Cannabis Health and Wellness Fair at Olive-Harvey College is also moving online.

Organized by the Chicago Cannabis Health Initiative, the event boasts pot-centric panels, demonstrations and presentations on a range of topics, including weed-infused cooking, cannabis rights and using the drug to deal with pain and post-traumatic stress disorder. Donte Townsend, founder of the Chicago chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, an advocacy group co-sponsoring the event, will give a virtual talk on CBD & hemp, a plant he’s been cultivating at a huge growth facility in Putnam County.

Though Townsend said it’s “a little heartbreaking” that plans had to be changed in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, he tried to look on the bright side.

“With what’s going on, we’ve found ways to be able to still offer a free service to the public about health and the beneficial uses of cannabis in its multiple forms that people can access from home,” he said.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

It’s one of several signs emerging from the virus outbreak of just how far ingrained marijuana has become in mainstream life in several states. Dispensaries are being designated “critical businesses” and are allowed to operate through statewide stay-at-home orders. Large markets such as California, Washington state and Oregon are allowing curbside pickup during the crisis.

Get the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.

Now under Colorado’s emergency rules, customers can pay for marijuana online and then pick up their purchase at the store.

“We have an opportunity to prove that cannabis businesses can run these operations and do so effectively under extremely dire circumstances,” said Morgan Fox, a spokesman for the Denver-based National Cannabis Industry Association.

Massachusetts, Michigan, Illinois and Oregon also allow online recreational marijuana sales. But the practice nonetheless remains severely limited because credit card companies tend to shy away from dealing with a drug that is still illegal under U.S. law.

Fox said easing restrictions on dispensaries is a step, but he doubts credit card companies will embrace the marijuana industry unless lawmakers provide some cover by passing the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act, which aims to protect financial institutions that serve cannabis-related businesses.

One example is Cannabis Station by Rocky Mountain High, a dispensary housed in an old filling station in downtown Denver. The dispensary has been providing curbside pickup after Gov. Jared Polis’ March 20 directive, but it hasn’t delved into online sales because it hasn’t found a credit card company willing to process the transactions.

The dispensary’s manager, Ben Prater, said he believes the state should allow deliveries during the crisis, as well. Home delivery of marijuana, which is already allowed in several states, was not covered by Polis’ order.

“We need to be able to have as little contact as possible to people. If people are sick or if they’re immunocompromised, they don’t need to be leaving their house during this time. So I think that delivery is just kind of a necessity at this point,” he said.

Colorado lawmakers last year legalized delivery but left it up to municipalities to decide if they want it. The state law allows for the delivery of medical marijuana this year and recreational cannabis in 2021.

In California, the Bureau of Cannabis Control endorsed a rule in January 2019 that allowed home marijuana deliveries statewide, even into communities that banned commercial pot sales. But even though the state has allowed broad legal marijuana sales since 2018, it remains unavailable in large areas where local governments have banned commercial activity or have not set up rules to allow sales.

“Delivery and access really need to be made available in every corner of the state,” especially during a pandemic, San Francisco-based cannabis attorney Nicole Howell said.

The coronavirus has provided the opportunity, however grim, to make that argument loud and clear — and not just in California.

Rachel Gillette, a Denver-based cannabis attorney and a board member of Colorado’s chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said she and the group have asked local elected officials to draft ordinances or resolutions to allow delivery of medical marijuana. But she acknowledged that could be difficult given the times.

“They may have a lot of other things on their plate than trying to figure out how to facilitate delivery for marijuana businesses,” she said, adding that allowing recreational pot delivery before next year would require legislative action.

The Colorado governor’s office said in an email there are no plans to allow businesses to apply for recreational marijuana delivery licenses before 2021, and online sales of recreational marijuana would not be allowed after the executive order expires.

The Marijuana Enforcement Division can’t authorize online recreational sales without a change in state law, but it will continue to evaluate whether the emergency rules should be amended, renewed or repealed, according to the governor’s office.

Gov. J.B.

All applications must be submitted by certified mail.

The applications were initially due March 16, but state officials earlier this month extended that deadline and ordered the agriculture department to accept all applications by mail in an effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.

The 40 licenses to operate small-scale grow centers will be awarded by July 1. Another 40 licenses will go to infusers which will manufacture processed pot products, like edibles. An unspecified number of transport licenses will allow companies to deliver marijuana on behalf of growers, dispensaries or community colleges with licensed pot training programs.

“While there is no limit on how many transporter licenses will be awarded, applicants must score at least 75% of the available points and meet all other requirements before being granted a transporter license,” the agriculture department wrote in the statement.

Application fees of $5,000 will be cut in half for applicants that meet social equity requirements by living in an area adversely affected by past drug policies, having a pot-related record or having a family member that meets the criteria.

State Rep. Sonya Harper (D-Chicago) introduced legislation last month that would allow cannabis dispensaries to deliver marijuana to both medical pot patients and recreational customers. Now, she’s calling on Gov. J.B. Pritzker to take immediate action amid the rising public health crisis.

Related How recreational weed went from illegal to essential in 3 months

“I would be happy to see if the governor maybe could make a special executive order allowing that, or us being able to get that legislation through maybe quicker than normal this year to provide for that,” said Harper, who co-sponsored the bill that legalized pot statewide at the start of the year.

That landmark piece of legislation didn’t include a provision allowing deliveries, though lawmakers discussed the prospect while it was being drafted.

Curbside pickup allowed

Harper’s push to allow pot deliveries in the wake of the coronavirus crisis comes two weeks after officials allowed retailers to temporarily sell medical marijuana outside stores to protect patients who may be susceptible to COVID-19. The state’s more than 100,000 medical users can also have a registered caretaker pick up pot products for them.

Harper acknowledged that setting up a system for deliveries would be “more difficult” than allowing those curbside sales.

“It would entail basically giving all municipalities and everybody across the state the ability to open up deliveries,” she said. “It would also be creating a new type of license.”

Pritzker’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment, but state officials appear to be mulling whether to open up deliveries. A representative of a major Illinois cannabis firm, who asked not to be named, said the company has been included in some recent conversations.

“The state has been open-minded to evaluating and implementing new processes for the convenience of medical patients during this crisis, like curbside pickup, and conversations about how home delivery would work have definitely been part of that dialogue,” the industry insider said.

Margo Vesely, executive director of the Illinois chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said her group has recently been lobbying lawmakers to allow deliveries to medical patients.

“I think that we have to really hone in and focus on those that have those compromised immune systems and really look out for them at these times,” said Vesely. “Medical patients, if they have a weakened immune system, can’t be going into the dispensaries. And if they don’t have a caretaker, they’re stuck.

“So it would be really beneficial for them,” she added.

Harper noted that she’s recently seen people waiting to get inside dispensaries and that curbside sales are also attracting lines of cars. As officials institute strict measures to promote social distancing, she said “mobile delivery is probably needed in this time more than ever.”

However, Harper said it’s unclear whether home deliveries could be established without legislative approval, like curbside pickups. Passing her bill quickly through the Legislature also seems unrealistic, as the coronavirus has shut down sessions in Springfield for weeks.

“As it stands right now, the bill hasn’t even been heard in committee yet,” said Harper. “So we really haven’t even had a chance to discuss it, to even see any way that the bill needs to be changed or amended to meet the different needs of the different municipalities.”

“I think if we had the political will we could get together in a room and put that together now, but I do see things like that maybe taking time to figure out the details.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Less than three months later, that type of mass clamoring is strictly forbidden as social distancing measures have been put in place to quell the spread of the novel coronavirus. In the uncertain age of COVID-19, when news and information travels almost as fast as the virus itself, Jan. 1 likely seems like a lifetime ago to many cannabis users.

Unlike thousands of businesses, however, pot stores have been able to keep their doors open under Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s statewide stay-at-home order, which labeled all dispensaries and cultivation centers “essential businesses.” The decision to allow the high times to keep rolling amid the rising public health crisis is an acknowledgment that, for many Illinoisans, buying weed is as vital as doing laundry or grocery shopping.

“People all over the nation are running to cannabis right now,” said Margo Vesely, executive of the Illinois chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, the country’s oldest weed advocacy group.

“People are selling out just like we are selling out of necessities, just like toilet paper and bread. A lot of people are dependent on it,” added Vesely, who noted that alcohol sales are also still allowed.

Similar to ibuprofen

As similar stay-at-home directives are being issued in states across the country, many have deemed marijuana businesses essential. In Massachusetts, medical sales are allowed to continue but recreational operations were forced to shut down on Monday — a move pot advocates said was short-sighted.

Vesely argued that it’s important for people who use the drug for health and wellness purposes to continue to have access to recreational pot. That’s because many of them simply can’t afford to pay for a doctor’s visit to get a prescription or the $100 registration fee for a medical license.

Meanwhile, Kris Krane, president of the Mission dispensary in South Chicago, likened recreational cannabis to over-the-counter medications, like ibuprofen.

“Saying we can’t be open for adult-use but we can only be open for medical would be akin to saying that CVS can only sell prescription medication,” Krane said.

On top of that, Krane noted, many people in Illinois simply need “stress relief in a time like this.”

“People might snicker about it, but it’s incredibly important,” said Krane. “People need some way to chill out, to unwind.”

Political sea change

While recreational weed is now considered essential in Illinois, it was still illegal just three months ago. The about-face can largely be attributed to Pritzker, who ran on a platform to end Illinois’ pot prohibition and made good on the promise.

Months before Pritzker announced his candidacy in 2017, his Republican predecessor Bruce Rauner came out strongly against the legalization of recreational marijuana, which he said would be a “mistake.”

Throughout his single term as governor, Rauner resisted multiple efforts to expand the medical program — though he also signed a bill that decriminalized pot in 2016. When he struck a deal with lawmakers that same year to extend the medical program for three years and add two qualifying conditions, he forced the Medical Cannabis Advisory Board to disband, Chicago Magazine reported.

The Chicago Democrats who led the legalization push, state Rep. Kelly Cassidy and state Sen. Heather Steans, first introduced legislation to legalize recreational weed the following year, but their identical bills didn’t gain much traction in either house of the General Assembly.

By the end of Rauner’s tenure, he signed off on an expansion to the program by establishing the Opioid Alternative Pilot Program, which gives people prescribed opioids access to medical weed. But even when he signed that bill, Rauner said he was “very much opposed to legalizing recreational marijuana.”

After unseating Rauner in the 2018 election, Pritzker championed new legislation introduced by Steans, Cassidy and other pro-pot lawmakers that sought to make the state’s nascent cannabis industry an inclusive engine for social change. In June, just over six months after taking office, he fully legalized weed statewide with the stroke of a pen.

For Krane, who has worked in the cannabis world for decades, Pritzker’s latest move to deem pot businesses as essential — which drew virtually no public opposition — is “a sign of how far we’ve come on this issue.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Representatives for three pot shops in the city confirmed that sales have spiked as the coronavirus spread across the state in recent weeks. Meanwhile, a similar trend has played out in other states that have legalized weed.

Kris Krane, president of 4Front Ventures, a multi-state pot firm that operates the Mission dispensary in South Chicago, said Wednesday that “sales have been up everywhere.” Krane said daily sales at some of the company’s medical stores in other states had even eclipsed those of April 20, an unofficial weed holiday that typically serves as “the highest volume sales day of the year.”

Krane said sales at the Chicago dispensary peaked on Monday before dipping slightly the following day when state regulators announced new guidelines for weed stores. To comply with those new rules and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mission started limiting the number of people allowed inside at once and reduced how many registers employees can operate.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, some Chicago shops have suspended recreational weed sales in order to prioritize medical patients. What’s more, GreenGate Chicago, a medical-only store in Rogers Park, announced Wednesday it was closing for two weeks, while The Herbal Care Center on the Near West Side shut down Thursday for cleaning.

Before closing their doors to recreational customers on Monday, Dispensary 33 in Uptown also saw sales jump.

“There was a bit of a spike,” said Dispensary 33 owner Bryan Zises. “We’re seeing people worried about having to leave their house and wanting to buy more than they generally would. Everyone is concerned. Everyone is just fearful.”

In terms of medical sales, Zises said a smaller number of patients are now buying more weed than they usually would. Zises noted that those folks are concerned about the state’s marijuana supply chain, which has been strained since recreational sales came online at the start of the year.

Jason Erkes, spokesman for Loop-based Cresco Labs, said the company’s store in Lake View has seen an uptick in customers in recent weeks — though it’s unclear whether the limited options have simply pushed more people to the few shops that are still selling recreational pot.

“It’s hard to gauge if we’re just picking up the people that would’ve shopped there or if they’re new people,” said Erkes

Dispensaries are permitted to sell medical cannabis products on their property, as well as on adjacent sidewalks or curbs until March 30, according to new guidance from the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation.

“Our top priority is to minimize the risk of and protect as many people as possible from exposure to COVID-19,” said Toi Hutchinson, Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s senior adviser for cannabis control. “These steps prioritize that critical objective, while also ensuring medical patients have access to the medicine they need.”

Patients in the state’s medical cannabis and opioid alternative programs and chosen caregivers will be able to purchase pot under the new guidance, while recreational customers will have to continue shopping inside.

Shops are also being advised to keep customers six feet apart by moving lines outside, closing cash registers and minimizing the time workers stand near customers. Employees should wear gloves while handling cash, frequently wash their hands and avoid asking patients to physically hand over their medical cards to be scanned, the IDFPR said.

Though pot deliveries are prohibited under state law, many stores have started encouraging customers to make orders online to expedite the shopping experience. Dispensaries that largely accept cash only will also be able to process transactions outside, allowing for curbside pick-ups.

Meanwhile, at least eight Illinois dispensaries have shut down adult-use sales to prioritize medical pot patients and others have limited the hours recreational users can shop. Among them are The Herbal Care Center on the Near West Side, MOCA Modern Cannabis in Logan Square and Dispensary 33 in Uptown.

”We understand that not everyone with a medical need has a medical card, but until further notice we can only serve medical patients,” Dispensary 33 posted on Twitter Monday.

Cresco Labs, the largest Illinois pot firm, will continue selling recreational cannabis at its four dual-use stores across the state, including at its store in Lake View.

“We feel that we need to continue to provide access for everyone that relies on cannabis for their daily well being, whether they’re a card carrying patient or not,” said Cresco spokesman Jason Erkes. “But we’ll obviously follow whatever state guidelines and mandates are put in place.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Forty-two more Indiana residents have died from coronavirus illnesses, pushing the state’s pandemic death toll from confirmed or presumed cases of COVID-19 to nearly 1,700, health officials said Friday.

Primary preparations

Federal funding has been used to buy supplies, including 200,000 face masks, 25,000 face shields, 5,000 gallons of hand sanitizer and 4,000 gallons of disinfectant cleaner for voting machines, Secretary of State Connie Lawson said Friday.

Shipments began this week and will continue next week to Indiana’s 92 counties, which are scheduled to begin early in-person voting on May 26 and have polling sites open on June 2. That protective equipment is meant for election staffers and won’t be provided to voters, Lawson said.

Election officials and state political leaders are encouraging mail-in voting as a way to protect poll workers and voters from possible COVID-19 exposure since deciding in late March to delay the primary by four weeks.

Voters face a Thursday deadline for requesting a mail-in ballot. The state has established an online ballot application available at Indianavoters.com, or application forms can be requested from county election offices. Those ballots must be received by county election offices by noon on June 2.

Lawson said that through Thursday about 330,000 mail-in ballots had already been cast — more than six times the total mail-in ballots submitted for the 2016 primary.

“Voting absentee by mail is safe and secure,” Lawson said. “It’s important to remember this isn’t a new process, it’s just an expansion of something that clerks do every election cycle. As we weather the COVID-19 storm, its the smartest way to vote.”’

Gov. Eric Holcomb agreed that voting by mail was the “smartest thing,” but said he planned to vote in person either early or on primary day.

“As long as we have the means to safely vote in person, I’m one of those people who subscribes to ‘I’m going to vote in person,’” Holcomb said.

Indiana has no challenged races for statewide elected offices in this year’s primary, although multiple candidates are seeking nominations for the congressional seats being given up by Democratic Rep. Pete Visclosky and Republican Rep. Susan Brooks. Many state legislative seats and county offices are also on the primary ballot.

More virus deaths

Most of the newly confirmed COVID-19 deaths reported by the Indiana State Department of Health occurred between Tuesday and Thursday, according to data posted by the agency.

Indiana has now recorded 1,550 confirmed deaths from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, along with 141 deaths considered coronavirus-related by doctors but without confirmation of the illness from test results.

Together, those deaths boost Indiana’s confirmed and probable deaths from the virus to 1,691 statewide.

Additional testing is becoming available around Indiana, with a state contractor opening 50 testing locations. The tests are available to those with symptoms of the respiratory illness, those in close contact with someone infected and people with high-risk health conditions.

The state health department said it is holding drive-through testing clinics through Sunday in Bluffton and Gary in northern Indiana, the western Indiana city of Sullivan and in Madison in southern Indiana.

The Abbott ID NOW test — which can provide results in minutes — is used by the White House to quickly test anyone who comes into proximity of President Donald Trump. Trump has lavished attention on the Abbott ID NOW test and featured it at a White House event three days after the FDA fast-tracked its approval by granting an emergency use authorization on March 27.

In just a few weeks time, Abbott has shipped 1.8 million of the ID NOW tests, which is used at several Chicago-area testing sites.

The FDA warning came a day after a New York University preliminary study raised questions about its accuracy. The study was not subject to peer review, a process that checks on the procedures used for a study as well as its findings.

“We are still evaluating the information about inaccurate results and are in direct communications with Abbott about this important issue,” Dr. Tim Stenzel, director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement.

“We will continue to study the data available and are working with the company to create additional mechanisms for studying the test. This test can still be used and can correctly identify many positive cases in minutes. Negative results may need to be confirmed with a high-sensitivity authorized molecular test.”

Abbott: Study flawed

Abbott, headquartered in Lake County near North Chicago, said the NYU study is flawed.

“We’re seeing studies being conducted to understand the role of ID NOW in ways that it was not designed to be used,” the company said in a statement. “In particular, the NYU study results are not consistent with other studies. While we’ve seen a few studies with sensitivity performance percentages in the 80s, we’ve also seen other studies with sensitivity at or above 90%, and one as high as 94%.

“While we understand no test is perfect, test outcomes depend on a number of factors including patient selection, specimen type, collection, handling, storage, transport and conformity to the way the test was designed to be run. ID NOW is intended to be used near the patient with a direct swab test method,” Abbott said.

That test compared findings between two systems: the Abbott ID NOW and the Cepheid Xpert Xpress. The samples were obtained from 101 patients with COVID-19 symptoms seeking treatment at New York University’s Langone Tisch Hospital.

In using one kind of nasal swab and liquid to store the sample, the “Abbot ID NOW COVID-19 missed a third of the samples detected positive by Cepheid Xpert Xpress” with the rate going to 48% using a different type of nasal swab, the study found.

Though the FDA acknowledged it was aware of some studies that have raised concern over the accuracy of Abbott’s device, the agency said in the statement it “is investigating whether it could be due to the types of swabs used or the type of viral transport media.”

Rapid testing is seen as key to easing stay-at-home orders and Abbott’s ID NOW was one of the first on the market.

Some inaccurate negative results

The Abbott ID NOW system also has the advantage that the machine used to analyze samples is about the size of a toaster and can be used anywhere.

Abbott and the FDA are currently working to analyze the information that has been gathered and to alert users that any negative results that aren’t consistent with a patient’s symptoms or signs should be confirmed with another test.

The FDA is now reviewing 15 “adverse reports” about the device which “suggest some users are receiving inaccurate negative results.” Abbott has also agreed to conduct post-market studies of the device that will include at least 150 COVID-19 patients in various clinical settings.

The FDA granted Abbott emergency use authorization — known as EUA — for the test on March 27. Abbott said in a release when the ID NOW went on the market, the “ID NOW COVID-19 rapid point-of-care test can provide test results in 13 minutes or less. Early detection can accelerate care, reduce viral spread and help people get on the road to recovery sooner.”

Physician here had doubts

At least one local physician has been hesitant to use the scrutinized Abbott test even before the new study.

When Dr. Rahul Khare started offering coronavirus testing at his clinic in Lincoln Park, he opted to use polymerase chain reaction tests that he sends to an outside lab for processing. Though it takes about three days to get results back, Khare didn’t even consider using the speedier Abbott test

Lightfoot refused to say what form that enforcement would take — not in a letter to religious leaders sent Thursday, and not in a follow-up conference call with reporters Friday.

It’s a politically perilous confrontation she is desperately trying to avoid by appealing to what she called the “better angels” of religious leaders and by confronting them with the cold, hard facts.

“We know that, when people are gathering, the risk goes up exponentially. And particularly, looking across the typical demographic of black churches in Chicago, it’s a lot of very faithful, but senior elders, many of whom have challenging underlying health conditions,” the mayor said.

Lightfoot noted 93% of Chicagoans who have died from the coronavirus have had underlying medical conditions.

“This is not playing Russian roulette. This is playing with a gun that’s fully loaded and cocked. It doesn’t make sense,” she said.

Lightfoot said she’s aware a “small handful” of churches have “advertised that they intend to hold services” Sunday in violation of Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order.

She’s been in contact with all of them — by letter and by phone — to try to “engage them in a conversation rather than being in conflict.”

“We let them know what our expectation is. We’re hopeful that we will not have to take any kind of enforcement action. But if we have to, we will,” Lightfoot said.

Pressed on what form “enforcement action” might take, the mayor would only say there are “a number of tools that we have as a result of this pandemic.”

“My hope, as always, is that our better angels will prevail. That we’ll be able to educate people into compliance,” she said.

“I’d rather be in conversation than in conflict. That’s the hand that we’ve extended. ... I hope that they will come to us in the same spirit.”

In her “Dear Members of the Chicago Faith Community” letter, Lightfoot urged religious leaders to “stay the course” and continue holding virtual services rather than meeting in-person — where it is difficult, if not impossible, to maintain social distance.

“I am resolute that I must enforce the rules of the governor’s stay-at-home order. To be fair to all, I simply cannot look away from noncompliance, no matter the source or the intention,” she wrote.

“Yes, limiting services and other important religious convenings — like funerals, baptisms, bat and bar mitzvahs, breaking fasts and weddings — is hard. But it remains every bit as important now as ever. ... This moment is very much about the cold reality of the facts ... how this virus is transmitted, and how ruthlessly it attacks.”

On Monday, Lightfoot had responded to Sunday services held the day before, in defiance of the order, by saying she hoped to educate religious leaders into compliance, avoiding mass arrests.

“We’re not gonna send in the police to arrest parishioners. People are exercising their faith, and I understand that,” she said then.

But the next day, the mayor made it clear she was serious about enforcing the governor’s order.

Her letter invites religious leaders to join her in a “conversation” about “what a gradual reopening will look like for protection of faith workers and congregants.”

The conversation began Friday during a phone call with religious leaders and will continue with the creation of what Lightfoot called a “working group across the various faith traditions to really get granular” about ways churches, mosques and temples can reopen safely.

“Making sure that we’ve got real guidance on everything from cleaning to face coverings,” Lightfoot said. “Can you sing with a mask? That was really the kind of level of detail that these faith leaders are likely thinking about.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Normally, the city issues general obligation bonds backed by property taxes to cover a more sweeping capital program. But these are not normal times.

The Lightfoot administration is preoccupied with the city’s response to the coronavirus and the budget crisis triggered by the stay-at-home shutdown of the Chicago economy.

So the decision was made to proceed only with those capital projects and purchases that absolutely needed to get done and to finance it with a line of credit that remained, even after Lightfoot saved $22 million by eliminating a $1.4 billion line of credit negotiated by former Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

The bare-bones capital plan is on the agenda for Monday’s Finance Committee meeting.

It includes: $83 million for the aldermanic menu program; $3 million for the shared sidewalk program; and $13.8 million to replace aging police cars and other city vehicles.

“We were taking applications for the shared sidewalks in January. So those commitments have already been made. We’ve got to get the snow plows ordered. We’ve got to get these police cars traded out. These are standard things that have to happen. And they can’t wait,” said Kristen Cabanban, a spokesperson for the city’s Office of Budget and Management.

And what is so urgent about the aldermanic menu program other than the fact that it’s a sacred cow politically?

“They do things like repair streets. They do a lot of infrastructure improvements too. Those things are important to residents as well,” Cabanban said.

A larger and more traditional general obligation bond issue is still a possibility later this year, Cabanban said. But, she quickly added, “We will need to go back and have that discussion at a different time. Right now, our priority is responding to COVID.”

Still unclear is what, if any, impact the shrunken capital plan will have on the $95 million police academy in West Garfield Park.

Last year, Emanuel got the go-ahead to issue $850 million in general obligation bonds to fund a laundry list of capital improvement projects. It included $65 million for the police and fire training, $30 million short of the original price tag.

Last summer, Lightfoot told reporters that the project that critics called a symbol of Emanuel’s misplaced spending priorities needed to be made bigger, better and, undoubtedly, more expensive.

After touring the old police academy and seeing recruits apprehending mock suspects in a dark hallway, Lightfoot said she was not at all certain that the two-building campus to be built at 4301 W. Chicago Ave. on 30.4 vacant acres was big enough to house a training facility that will be “best-in-class” not just when it opens, but for decades afterward.

“I don’t know that it’s big enough. I don’t know that the plans, particularly on the fire [department] side, are gonna provide them with the different kind of training scenarios that they need,” the mayor told reporters outside the current facility, 1300 W. Jackson Blvd.

“This is gonna be a significant investment on the West Side that desperately needs investment, but if we’re gonna make that kind of investment, I want to get it right. I want it to be the best-in-class training facility for first responders anywhere in the country. That’s what we ought to aspire to.”

Much like Wintrust Arena, the police academy project became a symbol of Emanuel’s misplaced priorities, critics said. For years, it has drawn fire from Chance the Rapper, Black Lives Matter and other groups who have organized under the #NoCopAcademy label.

Emanuel was even confronted by anti-academy protesters on college campus visits to other cities.

“All of these restrictions, they sound more like communism,” said Florin Cimpean, senior pastor at Philadelphia Romanian Church of God in the Ravenswood neighborhood, one of several dozen religious leaders who gathered Thursday outside the Thompson Center to take issue with Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order.

But Cimpean, who said he grew up in Soviet-controlled Romania, added: “Not even communists were able to completely shut down churches. We are essential. The spiritual, emotional and mental impact of this [coronavirus] will probably be greater long-term than the medical one.”

Cimpean said his church held services last week with about 40 people in attendance and plans to do so again this weekend — a violation of Pritzker’s order, which allows for a maximum religious gathering of 10 people, regardless of place of worship’s size.

The gathering Thursday came on the heels of a victory a day earlier for Pritzker, whose order survived a religious challenge in federal court from a pair of churches that sought to hold worship services with strict social-distancing guidelines in place.

The pastors gathered at the Thompson Center say the 10-person limit is arbitrary and doesn’t take into account the size of churches — some of which have large sanctuaries and could, they say, safely handle more parishioners.

Pastor Charles Mironas of Hope Community Bible Church in Park Ridge echoed the sentiments of his fellow religious leaders when he described the church as “essential.”

“If ever the world needed a church, it’s now,” Mironas said. “We are a balm of healing to the community. People need to know there is hope, need to know that there are answers.”

The pastors say they weren’t given a voice — weren’t invited to the table — before Pritzker issued his order.

Wilson, who organized the event, said the order doesn’t recognize that many in poorer communities might not have the option to shift services online, as has become common in more affluent North Side communities.

“You have a lot of homes in the poor communities that don’t even have Wi-Fi,” Wilson said. “They don’t have the technology. They can’t afford it.”

Mayor Lori Lightfoot has said she has no interest in having noncomplying parishioners or pastors arrested, but has also said she’ll do what needs to be done to make sure the rules are followed.

Asked if he’s concerned that violating the stay-at-home order might lead to an arrest, Cimpean said: “I don’t think the mayor will do that. But if they want to do that, let them come. It is what it is.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

It’s unknown how many of the businesses will survive, but officials said they hope the grants will help the smallest of small businesses in low- to moderate-income communities.

“These are businesses that don’t have a lot of options for help,” said Rosa Escareno, commissioner of the city’s Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection. “They are sole proprietors or they hire one or two people from down the block.”

One of the grant recipients, William Ball, owner of Abundance Bakery, 105 E. 47th St., said he’s struggling with how to reopen his 650-square-foot store. “We need to catch up on bills. My credit rating is going down the tubes. Thirty years, 650 square feet — it’s my life,” he said.

Ball said he’s waiting on word from other grants and loans he has applied for, but believes larger operators are in line ahead of him. “The government has to make some corrections in our community,” he said. “They have driven all the blue-collar jobs overseas. That’s why we have a high rate of crime. There’s just no opportunity.”

The grantees were selected by lottery from more than 4,500 applications, Escareno said. With help from five community organizations, the city vetted and picked recipients a week after the application period closed for the Microbusiness Recovery Grant Program. Escareno said all recipients will have the money in hand by Friday.

Money for the program came from the Chicago Community Trust, which continues to raise money for COVID-19 relief. Escareno said demand was so high, the grant program may be reopened to consider more applicants.

“From family-owned coffee shops to mom-and-pop retail stores, our microbusinesses are the beating heart of our communities and local economy,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said. “With the Microbusiness Recovery Grant Program, we are putting much-needed relief into the hands of nearly 1,000 of Chicago’s most-impacted local entrepreneurs so that we can reinvigorate communities on our road to recovery.”

Officials said that more than two-thirds of grantees reported in a survey that they have not received other emergency funding. To be eligible, businesses must have had four or fewer employees, annual revenue of less than $250,000 and be located within a low- or moderate-income community area.

More than 90% of the recipients were businesses headed by women, African Americans or Latinos, city officials said. On average, businesses getting the grants have been open for more than 10 years, they said.

Ald. Emma Mitts (37th) called the grants a “critical lifeline” to local businesses. “In less than two weeks, the city established a first-of-its-kind emergency grant program and is now putting those relief funds directly into the hands of our community entrepreneurs,” Mitts said.

The program is in addition to loans available under the city’s $100 million Small Business Resiliency Fund. Officials said the resiliency fund has approved 316 loans for nearly $12 million, with another 268 loans totaling $9.5 million in the final stages of underwriting.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

There have been 58,457 total cases of COVID-19 recorded in Cook County, which includes all of Chicago and many of its suburbs, after officials added 2,051 new cases in the last 24 hours. Queens, by comparison, added only 336 cases over the same time frame to bring its total to 58,084.

Cook County still has a lower rate of COVID-19 per capita given its population (5.1 million) is more than twice as large as Queens (2.25 million). But Queens also has a much higher population density with 20,500 people per square mile compared to 5,500 per square mile in Cook County, which can make social distancing measures more challenging to maintain.

Illinois officials announced Thursday that the statewide case total has increased to 87,937 while the death tally closes in on 4,000. Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s administration recently warned that projections show the state could see 50-150 deaths per day into June or later.

In addition to Queens, six other New York counties have been among the top ten nationwide for coronavirus case totals, while the next highest Illinois county — Lake — was No. 49 in the nation as of Wednesday with 5,662 cases.

Facing calls from some local leaders growing impatient with his phased plan to reopen regions of the state, Pritzker said “this virus is still among us.

Numerous Chicago suburbs have mandated that face masks be worn in certain public settings. And beginning May 1, Gov. J.B. Pritzker has ordered all people in Illinois “to wear a face-covering or a mask when in a public place where they can’t maintain a six-foot social distance.” That will last at least until May 31.

The federal government now advises Americans to wear cloth masks in public, especially in areas with significant community-based transmission.

Scientists say the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 will likely stick around indefinitely.

So with people possibly donning masks all summer and possibly into 2021, here’s what you need to know:

The different types of face masks

N95 masks: These disposable masks are fitted tightly to the face, with a metal bridge over the nose and bands that stretch around the head. They block 95% of particles of 0.3 microns or larger — but they’re not for most of us. These are the masks you see medical professionals wearing, often under their clear plastic face shields.

They block 95% of particles of 0.3 microns or larger — but they’re not for most of us. These are the masks you see medical professionals wearing, often under their clear plastic face shields. Medical or surgical masks: Also used by medical personnel but now being used by the general public, too, these disposable masks filter about 60% to 80% of particles. They consist of a rectangular, paper-like covering held across the face with stretchy loops over the ears.

Also used by medical personnel but now being used by the general public, too, these disposable masks filter about 60% to 80% of particles. They consist of a rectangular, paper-like covering held across the face with stretchy loops over the ears. Cloth masks: These can range from snug, double-layered, tightly-woven cloth masks with elastic ear loops (the best) to a bandana draped across your face (not as good).

Why wear a mask?

A mask helps keep droplets from your mouth or nose from getting on others. And a mask — even a good cloth mask — might help prevent virus particles from reaching your airway.

It’s thought that 25% or more of people with COVID-19 are asymptomatic, which means you or anyone you encounter could be silently shedding virus particles, says Margaret Gardel, a physics professor at the University of Chicago who is studying face masks as part of N95Decon.org, a multi-university consortium.

“This is the real reason we want the general public to be wearing masks,” she says.

But a mask is not magical. You still need to keep up social distancing, avoid touching your face and wash your hands frequently to protect yourself from the coronavirus.

Where can I get one?

N95 masks are being produced solely for medical providers and first-responders. So, unless you already have one at home, you won’t be able to get one.

If you do have an N95, you could use it for errands, with two caveats:

Use it only once a week to help ensure that any virus particles die off.

Understand that it’s a disposable mask that, after about five uses, will no longer seal as designed.

As for medical masks, it will be several months before we see wider availability, says Nezih Altay, a DePaul University professor and expert on supply chains. “Demand is way too high right now. And supply is not even close.”

Cloth masks are available online for around $7 and up from retailers or do-it-yourselfers.

This summer, expect to see face mask fashion take off. Community groups have been offering free cloth masks to people who need them.

You can make your own cloth mask, either a sew or no-sew version, using instructions from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

How should it fit?

A medical or cloth mask covers the face from the bridge of the nose, over the mouth and under the chin. It’s held in place by loops around the ears. Never drop one side to talk, as that defeats the purpose of the mask.

Unlike an N95 mask, which fits tightly around the nose and mouth, a medical or cloth mask will have gaps near the ears. Still, either type offers better protection than a bandana, which tends to gap right under the mouth, says Jill Crittenden, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who’s on the N95 consortium.

How should I clean a cloth mask?

Cloth masks should be washed daily in soapy water and run through a dryer on low heat or hung to dry.

Disposable medical masks should sit for a week before being used again. Crittenden says she has seven medical masks labeled “Monday,” “Tuesday,” “Wednesday” and so forth, which she rotates from week to week.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

8:57 p.m. DePaul, Loyola releases plans for fall semester

As coronavirus cases continue to increase statewide, two Chicago universities are planning to have students on campus this fall.

DePaul University and Loyola University of Chicago have consulted with public health experts and state and local officials to devise their plans for the fall semester.

DePaul expects to have limited in-person learning and reduced occupancy in the dorms this fall. Meanwhile, Loyola hopes to offer both on-campus and online classes.

Both universities said they’ll share more details about the fall semester in the coming weeks.

Loyola also announced its “Loyola Commitment,” a new financial aid program, funded by the university and its donors, which will help students who have been affected by the economic downturn amid the pandemic.

“As unemployment rises along with uncertainty about our economic outlook, we will see a sharp increase in students and families whose plans about attending Loyola might be hindered. Dreams are being crushed by diminished family finances,” Loyola provost Norberto Grzywacz wrote in an email to students. “The scale of this crisis and its financial impact on families will have a profound effect on many students from various backgrounds. In particular, it is expected to impact enrollment and our desire for a vibrant and diverse community as a place of growth, experience, and opportunity.”

8:13 p.m. Work-from-home Congress: House OKs proxy voting for first time

WASHINGTON — Neither Civil War nor Great Depression nor any other national crisis has pushed the House to allow lawmakers to vote by proxy — without being “present,” as the Constitution requires. That’s about to change during the coronavirus pandemic.

The House approved Friday a package of historic rules changes so Congress can keep functioning even while it’s partly closed. The shift will dramatically change the look, if not the operation, of the legislative branch — launching a 21st century WFH House, like others, “working from home.”

“This House must continue legislating,” Rep. Jim McGovern, the chairman of the House Rules Committee, said during a lengthy session ahead of the vote. “And we have to do so in a way that is safe for all those around us.”

Debate over the changes has been fierce. As President Donald Trump encourages Americans back to work, the 435-member House has stayed away due to health risks while the smaller Senate has resumed operations.

7:34 p.m. White Sox’ Eloy Jimenez says thank you with gifts for mask-making shop in Little Village

White Sox outfielder Eloy Jiménez honored a good cause with a good deed.

In a show of gratitude to a local bridal shop, Novias Davila in Little Village, Jimenez donated official Sox uniforms and funds to the shop, which is making face masks needed for the community during the coronavirus pandemic.

Shop owner Tania Hernández received a video message from Jiménez on Friday, thanking her team for their commitment to the community. Jimenez gave each of seven workers a $500 Jewel-Osco gift card and $500 in cash to provide support during this time.

The Little Village area had the most confirmed coronavirus cases of any single ZIP code in the state as of May 6. Jiménez asked that the face masks are donated to first responders in the neighborhood.

6:41 p.m. Corrupt ex-Ald. Ambrosio Medrano released from prison over coronavirus concerns

Former Chicago Ald. Ambrosio Medrano, convicted three times in corruption scandals, left prison this week as part of an effort to release inmates who are at-risk of contracting the coronavirus.

Federal Bureau of Prisons records show Medrano has been assigned to a residential re-entry management office in the Chicago area. Gal Pissetzky, the attorney who defended Medrano when he was sentenced in federal court six years ago, said Medrano is in a halfway house.

But for the rest of Medrano’s sentence, Pissetzky said, “he’s going to be on home confinement.” Medrano’s official release date isn’t until Sept. 14, 2025, prison records show.

5:53 p.m. ‘Stories from Six Feet’ documents search for connection in coronavirus isolation

It’s Angela Conners Treimer’s job to take photos of the most beautiful places on Earth.

As a commercial resort photographer, she travels over 100,000 miles each year, capturing luxurious images in places like Cabo and the Maldives.

So when the coronavirus started to spread and travel bans went into effect, Treimer was furloughed — for three months at least, and maybe longer.

“For the first time in three years, I wasn’t living on an airplane, you know? Whenever we were advised by the CDC to not travel, my world kind of flipped upside down,” she said. “I just started brainstorming: What am I going to do for the next three months? This is the first time in my life that I haven’t had a 9 to 5.”

Searching for normalcy and human connection, she decided to look for beauty elsewhere.

That’s how her project, “Stories from Six Feet,” came to be.

“Stories from Six Feet” is a photo series that documents the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting Chicago through the eyes of its residents in isolation. The project lives on Instagram under the handle @StoriesFromSixFeet.

5:16 p.m. 7 more workers at Juvenile Detention Center contract COVID-19

Seven more employees of Cook County’s Juvenile Temporary Detention Center have tested positive for COVID-19, officials said Friday.

There are now six detainees and 17 employees at the facility that have contracted the coronavirus, according to the Circuit Court of Cook County’s Office of the Chief Judge spokesman Pat Milhizer.

Six of the employees tested positive after receiving on-site tests that began last week for all employees at the detention center, Milhizer said. No one showed symptoms when they were tested.

4:23 p.m. Library workers return to work Wednesday to prepare for eventual reopening. Exactly when? Unclear.

It’s unclear when Chicago’s 81 libraries will reopen, but staff are returning to their jobs Wednesday to prepare for the day when doors will be flung open and patrons will be welcomed back.

“Absolutely no date has been set to open libraries to the public, and any reopening decision would be consistent with public health guidance and dependent on where our data is at that time,” Jordan Troy, a spokesman for Mayor Lightfoot, said in an email Friday.

“As the mayor has stated since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, every decision made in city government will be guided by science and data.”

Libraries have been closed since March 21.

3:15 p.m. President Trump still confident in Abbott’s virus test despite false negatives

Trump expressed his confidence in the test from Abbott Laboratories after a preliminary study by New York University researchers reported problems with it. Trump and his deputies have have promoting the 15-minute test as a “game changer.”

The Food and Drug Administration announced late Thursday it was investigating preliminary data suggesting the Abbott test can miss COVID-19 cases, falsely clearing infected patients.

“Abbott is a great test; it’s a very quick test,” Trump said at a Rose Garden event to highlight his administration’s efforts to develop a vaccine for the virus. “And it can always be very rapidly double checked.”

The test is used daily at the White House to test Trump, key members of his staff as well as any visitor to the White House complex who comes in close proximity to the president or Vice President Mike Pence.

2:45 p.m. Coronavirus now in 100 Illinois counties as state tops 4K deaths, 90K cases

COVID-19 is now in 100 of Illinois’ 102 counties, as Friday marked the fourth day in a row that the state has seen more than 100 lives lost — and the 18th such day since the pandemic began.

With the latest 130 deaths, the state has lost 1,727 people so far in May, and 4,058 overall.

There were also 2,432 more people testing positive among the latest batch of 26,565 test results, officials said. And Edgar County became the 100th county to record positive cases in the state.

There have been 90,369 confirmed coronavirus cases since the pandemic began.

The state’s overall positivity rate — the number of positive cases compared to total tests received — was 9.1%. And the Northeast region, home to Chicago, Cook and the collar counties, remained under 20%, a benchmark set for further to enter the next phase of Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s regional reopening plan.

2:36 p.m. Cook County surpasses Queens, NY, as county with most COVID-19 cases in U.S.

Cook County has surpassed Queens County in New York as the U.S. county with the most coronavirus cases based on Sun-Times analysis of the latest public data.

There have been 58,457 total cases of COVID-19 recorded in Cook County, which includes all of Chicago and many of its suburbs, after officials added 2,051 new cases in the last 24 hours. Queens, by comparison, added only 336 cases over the same time frame to bring its total to 58,084.

Cook County still has a lower rate of COVID-19 per capita given its population (5.1 million) is more than twice as large as Queens (2.25 million). But Queens also has a much higher population density with 20,500 people per square mile compared to 5,500 per square mile in Cook County, which can make social distancing measures more challenging to maintain.

1:55 p.m. Lightfoot hints at street closures to help restaurants

Is Mayor Lori Lightfoot planning to close streets and sidewalks so restaurants can safely reopen and give residents a place to run, walk and play? Sure sounds like it.

“People are itching to get outside. Businesses are looking at creative ways to serve customers. The key is how we do it,” the mayor tweeted Friday.

“Stay tuned for some changes to our streets and sidewalks. Transportation is more than just cars. We’ll show how Chicago can be safer and easier to get around.”

Last week, Illinois Restaurant Association President Sam Toia urged Gov. J.B. Pritzker to relax his five-step plan to reopen Illinois by allowing restaurants to open at 25% of capacity beginning June 1 with strict safeguards for restaurant employees, including face masks and daily temperature checks.

At the time, Toia teased the street closing idea.

1:27 p.m. Lightfoot warns religious leaders she is prepared to enforce stay-at-home order

Mayor Lori Lightfoot has appealed to religious leaders to not defy Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order — and warned she is prepared to “enforce the rules” if they don’t.

In a “Dear Members of the Chicago Faith Community” letter sent Thursday, Lightfoot urged religious leaders to continue holding virtual services rather than in-person services, where it is difficult, if not impossible, to maintain social distance.

“I am urging you to stay the course. If there is a problem, I would rather be in conversation than in conflict. But to be clear, I am resolute that I must enforce the rules of the governor’s stay-at-home order. To be fair to all, I simply cannot look away from non-compliance, no matter the source or the intention,” she wrote.

On Monday, Lightfoot responded to Sunday service defiance by saying she hoped to educate religious leaders into compliance, avoiding mass arrests.

“We’re not gonna send in the police to arrest parishioners. People are exercising their faith, and I understand that,” she said then.

But the next day, the mayor made it clear she was serious about enforcing the governor’s order and she would do what she must.

12:59 p.m. Cubs chairman Tom Ricketts not sure baseball will be played this season: report

Cubs chairman Tom Ricketts told season-ticket holders he is not sure baseball will be played this year.

According to a story published by The Athletic, Ricketts said the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, conflicts over the best time to reopen businesses, and continuing negotiations between the owners and players could combine to prevent the start of the season.

“I don’t think anyone can answer that question just yet,” Ricketts said during a virtual forum with season-ticket holders Thursday. “The current thinking and the current discussions (among owners) have been all around trying to get back into our home ballparks for this season. Obviously, without fans. Now that creates three specific problems that we have to address.”

The team has been consulting with health professionals on the best way to make Wrigley Field safe, according to a recording of Cubs president Crane Kenney obtained by The Athletic.

12:26 p.m. The high cost of quarantine

In a letter to the Sun-Times editors, Tom Gregg of Niles writes:

Before the quarantine, I was visiting my 99-year-old mother twice a day in our retirement home, and she was holding her own in terms of her health. She is vision-impaired, hearing-impaired, arthritic and suffering from mild dementia, certainly, but for 13 years in two homes she had largely been able to avoid hospital stays for life-threatening problems. Plus, her interaction with me seemed to greatly help in minimizing her spells of confusion.

But now, during our relatively brief period of enforced separation — I live on a lower floor while she lives up on an assisted living floor — she has contracted pneumonia, for which she has been in and out of hospital, and her spells of confusion seem to be worsening. Symptomatic, doubtless, of the unprecedented disorientation.

My mother remains among the living today, but for how long if she remains so isolated? Now multiply this single case by all the other seniors around the country who have seen their precious interactive routines disappear. It is a situation that many of them, given their cognitive limitations, have difficulty grasping.

This potentially lethal hardship is worth noting when we are formulating pandemic recovery plans. The cure of the quarantine shouldn’t cost more than the contagion itself, should it?

11:44 a.m. What’s the first meal you’ll want at a restaurant post-pandemic? We asked, Chicagoans answered.

With eat-in dining at restaurants on hold because of the state’s coronavirus stay-at-home order, the next time you’ll be waited on at a restaurant probably won’t be for a while.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s five-phase plan for reopening Illinois businesses puts restaurant reopenings in Phase 4. We’re now in Phase 2.

So with Chicagoans craving a meal out, we asked: Once restaurants reopen for dining in, what’s the first meal you’ll want to eat out, and from where? Some of these answers have been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.

“Breakfast at a Greek joint: feta cheese-and-spinach omelet, hashbrowns and an English muffin or pancakes.” — Rose Panieri

10:08 a.m. How we should honor our youngest COVID-19 victim

Ernesto Guzman, age 12, suffered from asthma and obstructive sleep apnea, two other underlying health problems with potentially serious consequences that have figured into many other COVID-19 deaths, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office.

But make no mistake, doctors say it was the coronavirus that caused the pneumonia that took Ernesto’s life early Thursday morning at Advocate Christ Medical Center, Oak Lawn.

Because his death occurred after midnight, it is not yet counted among the 3,928 official COVID-19 deaths in Illinois, but it was listed among the single-day record high of 126 deaths reported Thursday from Cook County by the medical examiner.

Will the death of a 12-year-old boy cause more people to take this disease seriously? Mark Brown says he doubts it. But he hopes that will change.

“Take this seriously, folks,” he wrote. “Take it very seriously, because the life you risk may not be your own.”

8:49 a.m. Abbott rapid COVID-19 test may yield false negatives, FDA warns

The federal Food and Drug Administration issued a warning Thursday night that early data suggests Abbott Laboratories’ rapid coronavirus test, touted by the Trump administration as a game changer, may return inaccurate and false negative results — findings the Chicago-area firm vehemently denied.

The Abbott ID NOW test — which can provide results in minutes — is used by the White House to quickly test anyone who comes into proximity of President Donald Trump. Trump has lavished attention on the Abbott ID NOW test and featured it at a White House event three days after the FDA fast-tracked its approval by granting an emergency use authorization on March 27.

In just a few weeks time, Abbott has shipped 1.8 million of the ID NOW tests, which is used at several Chicago-area testing sites.

The FDA warning came a day after a New York University preliminary study raised questions about its accuracy. The study was not subject to peer review, a process that checks on the procedures used for a study as well as its findings.

7:03 a.m. ‘Grandstanding’ by Grand Old Party? Or is Pritzker masking his decisions?

SPRINGFIELD — After weeks of nudges from Republican legislators, the General Assembly is planning to return to Springfield to get back to work.

And as they prepare for the Legislature’s long-sought session next week, Republicans said Thursday they are willing to comply with safety guidelines issued by the Democrats – but they want an examination of their own.

GOP lawmakers said they will wear face coverings, submit to COVID-19 tests and temperature checks and follow other safety measures when they return to Springfield, but they balked at signing a pledge to follow those recommendations as requested by House Speaker Mike Madigan.

And Republicans want to put Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s “Restore Illinois” plan under the microscope with a public hearing.

GOP lawmakers have criticized Pritzker’s “Restore Illinois” plan as “arbitrary,” saying the dates in which parts of the states can begin to reopen don’t make sense, and its metrics ignore geographical differences in COVID-19’s impact.

6:45 a.m. With the focus on the coronavirus, Lightfoot opts for bare-bones capital plan

Singularly focused on the war against the coronavirus, Mayor Lori Lightfoot has opted for a $100 million, bare bones capital plan — bankrolled by an existing line of credit — to pay for new vehicles, sidewalks and the treasured aldermanic menu program.

Normally, the city issues general obligation bonds backed by property taxes to cover a more sweeping capital program. But these are not normal times.

The Lightfoot administration is preoccupied with the city’s response to the coronavirus and the budget crisis triggered by the stay-at-home shutdown of the Chicago economy.

So the decision was made to proceed only with those capital projects and purchases that absolutely needed to get done and to finance it with a line of credit that remained, even after Lightfoot saved $22 million by eliminating a $1.4 billion line of credit negotiated by former Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

7:47 p.m. Everything must be on the table as city, state fight back from financial devastation

Washington to cities and states: You’re on your own.

For months, the Trump administration has failed to take the lead in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, punting responsibility to the states. Now the president and his Republican Party are looking to do the same when it comes to helping states and cities survive the pandemic’s financial devastation.

A $3 trillion stimulus package expected to be approved by the Democratic-controlled House looks dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate, and President Donald Trump is making clear he would never sign such a bill.

Why? Because the package to rescue drowning cities, suburbs, states, small businesses and unemployed Americans would be fiscally imprudent, they claim.

We couldn’t disagree more. And, yes, this is the same Senate and president who rewrote the federal tax code in 2017 to give billions of dollars in tax cuts to the wealthiest one percent of Americans, ballooning the federal deficit.

So what does all this mean for Illinois and Chicago, as well as for towns and counties statewide?

6:35 p.m. Gov. Pritzker fumbles rollout of ‘Restore Illinois’

For many weeks after the beginning of this COVID-19 crisis, Gov. J.B. Pritzker proved adept at telegraphing his every move.

Pritzker waited until people practically begged him to shut down the schools on March 15. He talked about issuing a stay-at-home order for days, and then acted on March 21 only after California jumped first.

It was clear for days that he would extend his stay-at-home order another month starting April 1. He talked for well over a week about a mask-wearing requirement, always noting that he was being lobbied by Republican state Rep. Mark Batinick before finally announcing the order on April 23.

People did not always agreed with him, but they always had a sense of where he was going. Pritzker did get out over his skis when his Illinois Workers’ Compensation Commission dramatically altered the burden of proof on COVID-19 illnesses in favor of employees without so much as a heads-up to business groups. But most regular folks never noticed that and a court intervened and stopped the order anyway.

Otherwise, the governor did a remarkably good job of making sure the public was always aware in advance of his leadership direction.

And then on May 5 he announced his “Restore Illinois” roadmap to gradually reopen the state.

6:53 a.m. Chicago’s flag, civic pride and the fight against COVID-19

If Chicago were to add a fifth star to the city’s flag, an awful lot of hipsters would have to get their tattoos reworked.

Maybe it’s best we just leave the flag as it is, even if the city manages to prevail against COVID-19.

Last Friday and again on Wednesday, Mayor Lori Lightfoot floated the idea of adding a fifth red star to Chicago’s flag to mark the city’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. She was trying to rally the city. If Chicago’s effort to beat the virus is terrifically successful, she said Friday, it will “truly warrant a fifth star on our flag.”

But let’s be blunt. Chicago’s not about to be terrifically successful anytime soon. Nobody is. This is a global public health war that’s sure to be fought for years, and a lot of people are setting us up to lose.

6:10 a.m. Navy Pier is an arm of government, no matter what it claims — so let’s see every contract

Now that the nonprofit that runs Navy Pier is getting a federal stimulus loan of nearly $2.5 million, it’s really way past time that it opened its books to the public completely.

Navy Pier Inc., which leases the 104-year-old pier from the public, is a government body that masquerades as a nonprofit organization. As such, it has been allowed to hide its workings from public scrutiny while benefiting from public support.

Navy Pier Inc. pays just $1 a year to the state and city to lease the pier.

And just this week, Sun-Times reporters Tim Novak and Robert Herguth revealed that the organization, whose president is paid more than $540,000 a year, has received a nearly $2.5 million coronavirus stimulus loan from the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program.

Like all nonprofits, Navy Pier Inc. must disclose much of its finances by filing 990 forms, but it does not have to comply with Freedom of Information Act requests or disclose the terms of contracts.

It was March 12, and she had returned home to New York the night before from a meeting with the NWSL’s staff in Chicago. Baird checked Twitter before going to bed, like so many do, but this time her timeline read nothing like a typical social-media feed.

NBA commissioner Adam Silver had just announced the season would be postponed after Rudy Gobert tested positive for the coronavirus.

Baird spent the next morning contemplating taking public transportation to a meeting with league sponsor Budweiser. She opted to drive instead and headed out for what unknowingly would be her last day working from anywhere but home.

“We had a great meeting with Budweiser,” Baird said. “I don’t think any of us had any idea [what was coming]. I went home, and, literally, your email and Twitter feed start filling. You’re rapidly and in real time assessing the situation. It was like watching the dominoes fall.”

Baird acted swiftly and announced the postponement of the NWSL’s preseason on March 13, and within a week, the season was postponed indefinitely.

Right now, the league is planning for the final weekend in June as a target start date.

Red Stars owner Arnim Whisler added that the league hopes to get 16 to 20 games in this season and that the NWSL hopes to become the first professional sports league to return to play. The Red Stars’ target start date to resume the preseason is May 5, but Whisler said that could change.

The NWSL caters to a much smaller fan base than any other pro sports league. The teams’ stadiums are more modest, and for the Red Stars, there is even the potential to seat fans further apart from one another at SeatGeek Stadium.

“There are some silver linings,” Whisler said. “We’re smaller. We’re more nimble. We only have nine teams that we have to plan around. So our goal is to be the first ones playing again. It’s easy for us to pull off because we aren’t used to 40,000-plus crowds.”

The NWSL was carrying the momentum from the U.S. women’s national team’s fourth World Cup title, a freshly signed TV contract with CBS and a promising sponsorship deal with Budweiser into its eighth season.

The league’s average attendance was 7,383 last season, and Baird’s primary goal as commissioner is to continue to build off that 22.6% increase from 2018. She believes the anticipation for the 2020 Olympic Games — which have been postponed to 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic — will help that cause.

“The global landscape for women’s soccer never rests,” Baird said. “What I need to do as a spokesperson for the league is continue to point to how exciting the future is for women’s soccer. That’s the key.”

The league as a whole hasn’t lost any sponsors, and Whisler said the Red Stars have maintained all of their sponsorship deals since the postponement of the season was announced.

Whisler has not laid off or furloughed any front-office employees, and the organization has applied for some of the federal loans available to keep his workforce together.

Still, uncertainty remains surrounding the TV deal with CBS.

CBS was set to air two games, the season opener April 18 between the Washington Spirit and OL Reign and the league championship game. CBS Sports Network would air another 14 games, and 71 more would’ve been on CBS All Access, the network’s subscription streaming service. But now there are no guarantees because of the overlap that’s likely to occur with other leagues.

“CBS and all sports programming has been pulled down,” Whisler said. “So all the windows are wide open right now. If we can return quickly, there is a lot of airtime to fill. Twitch will have us whenever we’re ready. CBS, depending on when things turn back on, will have to rethink some of the TV windows.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Many of them haven’t even hit the high point of their time in the game and are still on the ascent.

At 35, left back Jonathan Bornstein still has plenty left to give on the field, but his timeline is different than his colleagues’ and the end is closer than the beginning. And as COVID-19 eats away at the season, it’s taking away from the moments he has left in competitive soccer.

“I’ve thought about that, actually, quite a bit,” Bornstein said. “Obviously, the closer you get to the end of your career, you almost cherish every game, every practice a little bit more. Not being able to train with the team due to extenuating circumstances is a bit of a Debbie Downer kind of a thing, but at the same time I’m very thankful that my family and I are healthy and we’re here with the support of the team.”

That isn’t to say the end of Bornstein’s career is imminent. He certainly doesn’t think so, and the way his time in Chicago has started indicates he can still play at a high level.

After joining the Fire last summer, Bornstein solidified a spot that had given the team trouble and helped the back line finally mesh. Bornstein’s strong form carried over to the first two games of 2020, and he even scored in the Fire’s 1-1 draw March 7 at New England to help secure the team’s first point of the year.

As it turned out, that would be their last appearance for a long time. The pandemic halted the sports world the next week, and it’s unclear when and how the season will resume and when Bornstein will be reunited with his teammates.

Bornstein already is looking forward to that moment, whenever it arrives. But it won’t be the start of a farewell.

“Once we get started again, I’ll be even that much more anxious to be on the field and to be making the most of my time that I have left,” Bornstein said. “I try not to think too much about it because, to be honest, my goal is to play until I’m 40, so I’ve got another five years, if it all goes to plan. I try not to let the situation get me down as much as I can.”

The thing is, nobody knows when soccer will return. Bornstein is hoping it comes back sooner than later. He’d rather play in the summer than the end of 2020. But he doesn’t have control over the timeline.

He’s just trying to stay mentally and physically prepared for whatever comes his way.

“I think the uncertainty in any aspect of life is always what’s scary,” Bornstein said. “Doubt casts a shadow upon what could be, what couldn’t be, and at this point, we’re almost all living in the shadow of doubt. It’s a bit of an unsettling thought, but you’ve got to have faith that eventually we’re going to get through all of this and we’ll be able to get back to some sort of normality.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The World Cup in France put a spotlight on women’s soccer, culminating with the United States lifting the trophy to chants of “Equal Pay!” — a nod to the team’s gender discrimination lawsuit against U.S. Soccer — and the sport remained in the public eye to open the year. The professional National Women’s Soccer League, home to many of the U.S. national team’s players, was expecting to open its eighth season with a new television contract.

Women’s pro softball was looking toward the sport’s return to the Olympics for the first time since 2008. Professional volleyball, which enjoys popularity in Europe, Russia and Brazil, similarly draws peak interest in an Olympic year.

Any momentum these leagues, and women’s sports in general, had worldwide has seemingly been halted by the pandemic. Now the question is whether women will lose the gains they had made when life returns to normal.

“If the seas get choppy and rough and you’re out there in a yacht, you can go downstairs and live it up and ride it out. You can eat good, drink good and all that. Men’s sports are the ones with the yacht,” said Cheri Kempf, commissioner of the National Pro Fastpitch softball league. “But if you’re out there in a canoe, and seas get choppy, you’re in big trouble. And that’s women’s sports. You know, we’re riding around out there in a canoe.”

Among the signs women’s sports could suffer more was the recent decision by Independiente Santa Fe in Colombia to suspend all player contracts for its women’s soccer team while saying the men’s team would only see pay cuts.

The impact of COVID-19 and the resulting hit to the economy could resemble the 2008 recession. The Houston Comets of the WNBA could not find a buyer and the league contracted back then. Whirlpool, meanwhile, pulled out of its planned sponsorship of Women’s Professional Soccer, which had the unfortunate timing of launching in 2009 and lasted just three seasons.

The WNBA is in better shape today than many women’s sports because of its affiliation with the NBA. The league has put off the start of the season, set for May 15, but Commissioner Cathy Engelbert recently suggested it might be able to return sooner rather than later.

“We might be able to tip this season off before some other leagues since we only have 12 teams and 144 players,” she told The Associated Press.

But there are concerns among those who aren’t similarly positioned.

Volleyball player Kelsey Robinson, who is on the U.S. team that was bound for the Tokyo Olympics this summer before the games were postponed, can usually make a living playing overseas, like many national team players. She was just heading into the playoffs with her club in Turkey, which has a thriving professional volleyball league, when play was suspended. Now she worries about her opportunities in a post-pandemic world.

“It’s hard to say what will happen in Turkey or China, where there are pretty strong economies for sport. But for sure, Italy I know will have to decrease salaries, maybe not at the top team, but I’m sure it’ll affect lower teams and clubs,” Robinson said. “We’re not finishing the season right now or playing, so that’s a hard financial burden for our club because a lot of the salaries for the coming season depends on how we finish in the playoffs.”

NWSL Players Association executive director Yael Averbuch West said current fears about losses are legitimate.

“I think that everybody is afraid of that. And especially right now, looking at women’s soccer and coming off of what we feel is a huge positive momentum after the World Cup, and the NWSL doing really well and continuing to grow, it’s obviously a concern. This is tough for everyone, including the ownership groups, the fans, the players, the league office,” Averbuch West said.

The international soccer players’ union, FIFPro, issued a report Thursday warning of the impact the coronavirus could have on women’s soccer worldwide and recommended mitigation measures, including continued investment.

“Who knows what the future will bring?” said forward Jodie Taylor, who plays for the NWSL’s Reign and England’s national team and sits on the FIFPro player council. “It’s a reality, it’s a stressful reality, and one that the world’s kind of sitting back and waiting for.”

Athletes in individual sports could be hit hardest. Tennis, golf and track athletes are largely dependent on competing to earn a paycheck, and that’s currently impossible. The athletes face uncertainties going forward: When the events do return, will the sponsors remain? Will younger prospects fall away from those sports out of economic necessity?

The WTA said last week that its planned start date is now July 13. Wimbledon has been canceled for this year.

“Health and safety remains the top priority as we navigate the challenges ahead in these unprecedented times, and we will do everything we can for the tour to resume at the earliest opportunity once it is safe to do so,” ATP Chairman Andrea Gaudenzi said.

The National Pro Fastpitch softball league was hit particularly hard. The 17-year-old league included national teams from Australia, Canada and China this season in preparation for the Olympics. Australia and Canada have already said that even if the league gets off the ground this season, they won’t participate.

“I don’t want to say that I’m worried that we won’t survive,” Kempf said. “But I think that common sense would dictate and tell you that it’s a hit for everyone.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The hires of sporting director Georg Heitz and coach Raphael Wicky were well-received, and the WGN-TV and Arlo White announcements were applauded. The work of the business staff was set to pay off with a record crowd as the Fire made their return to Soldier Field against Atlanta United, a franchise they hope to emulate

But that has been put on hold by COVID-19, which forced MLS to pause its season and postponed the Fire’s big day. Understandably, chief operating officer John Urban said there was some disappointment within the front-office staff when that news came down, though the overriding reaction has been a sense of resolve and optimism.

“When you ask about morale, the reality is that the success that was there and will be there, we’ll still have that day,” Urban told the Chicago Sun-Times. “It’s just going to come a little later than planned, but for right now we’re focused on the health and wellness of the entire Fire family and our fans and players and partners. We’ll get back to it, but that momentum is something that has stuck with everybody.”

Urban said the Fire were tracking toward 60,000 tickets sold for March 21, which would have been a sellout. Eventually, the Fire business side will welcome fans to Soldier Field for an opener, and they’re already considering the delicate balance of celebrating a big day while keeping the right tone in the wake of the pandemic.

Urban said the Fire want to “be a source of strength in these times.”

“We can be a source of enjoyment or diversion through some of the stories and connections that we have with fans and players and memories,” Urban said. “Not a day goes by that we don’t think about finding that right voice, finding our place in the citywide landscape and dialogue. It’s going to be an important thing. When we do come back, we’ve got to make sure we’re calibrated properly. It’s going to be key.”

That consideration also relates to how the front office is trying to maintain that momentum through what could be a lengthy break in the season. Urban said staying in touch with the fans thoughtfully and sensitively is a goal, and he’s proud of the Fire’s participation in Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s “We Are Not Playing” campaign along with the city’s other major-league professional teams.

The unique situation also gives the Fire staff, which sources say hasn’t been furloughed or seen a pay cut, a chance to work in ways they otherwise wouldn’t.

“We’re working remotely here, every day we’re looking at opportunities, we’re looking at things that we can do to take advantage of some of the time that we now have to plan and to lean into some initiatives, both things that have arisen through the current situation, but also our business and the 2020 season generally,” Urban said. “The word momentum and the level of energy and commitment, we’re still working on it every day.

“If there are things we can do or ideas we can now explore because we have the luxury of a little bit of time, we’re taking advantage of all of that and being aware of the situation around us.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The new campaign, announced Monday by Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s office, is intended to support the stay-at-home order in place throughout Illinois and most of the rest of the United States.

“I am grateful to each of our hometown teams for stepping up and doing their part by joining in this call for every neighborhood and community,” Lightfoot said in a press conference at Soldier Field. “They’re not playing, and neither are we. The more we stay home and act responsibly, the more lives we’ll save.”

The campaign will be spread on digital and physical billboards throughout the area, then move onto online and social media channels, per a press release.

“This is a disease that doesn’t discriminate. It really doesn’t,” Lightfoot said. “And young people—I remember back in the day thinking nothing could stop me. That I was invincible. If we can get credible messengers like sports athletes who can really reach sports fans, but also young people in particular — that’s why we’re activating this group of people. We know that they have cache. We know that they have reach.”

Easily recognizable athletes from every team — including Jonathan Toews of the Blackhawks, Jason Heyward of the Cubs, Eloy Jimenez of the White Sox and Coby White of the Bulls — will participate with videos and messages encouraging Chicagoans to stay home.

“Sports has always served as a great example of achieving a common goal and overcoming the odds,” Cubs executive chairman Tom Ricketts said. “If we can all do our part to follow public health guidelines to stay at home, we can slow or stop the spread of this disease. Stay inside so that we can come together and watch baseball soon.”

Although no pro sports have taken place in the city in weeks, the motto is still jarring during a time where nearly every Chicago team would normally be either in-season or gearing up for it.

The Cubs were initially scheduled to have finished a six-game homestand Sunday and start a series in Pittsburgh on Monday. The White Sox were supposed to host the Mariners in a Monday matinee, starting their own series.

The Blackhawks would’ve just concluded their regular season Saturday against the Rangers, and the Fire would’ve hosted the Red Bulls that same day. The Bulls would be starting a pair of Staples Center road games, Monday against the Clippers and Wednesday against the Lakers, with two home games left on the schedule.

And the Sky and Red Stars would have been anticipating their season openers a few weeks away.

Lightfoot was asked about the possibility of professional football and other major sporting events resuming without fans in the stands.

“We’re not at that point yet. But, I know that the various sports leagues are talking about a variety of different options, depending on how long the public health personnel believe that we need to be reducing the size of crowds,” she said.

Instead, the entire Chicago sports scene — along with much of the rest of the city — is paused indefinitely.

Monday’s campaign announcement seeks to translate that blatantly obvious reality into day-to-day behavior changes for fans of the seven teams, emphasizing self-isolation activities that will flatten the curve over time and limit the burden on the city’s overloaded medical system.

“For every sports team in Chicago, our fans have been there for us, in both good times and bad,” White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf said. “The teams receive so much support from our fans that it is our responsibility to give back whenever and however we can.”

“As far as time-outs go, none are more important to our fans than this one,” Blackhawks chairman Rocky Wirtz added. “All of us need to listen to the experts by staying off the field of play and stay at home. We owe that to ourselves, but we especially owe it the people that do not have that stay-at-home option, beginning with our front-line responders.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The English league had given a tentative return date of April 30 but that was pushed back with a statement saying the “2019-20 season will only return when it is safe and appropriate to do so” and only with the full support of government and medical guidance.

“There is a combined objective for all remaining domestic league and cup matches to be played,” the league said, “enabling us to maintain the integrity of each competition.”

Teams still have nine or 10 games left to play, with Liverpool — the leader by 25 points — still needing two more wins to clinch its first title since 1990.

UEFA, in a letter signed by the European Clubs’ Association and the European Leagues, has urged members not to abandon their competitions. Halting leagues without approval from UEFA could see teams blocked from qualifying for the Champions League and Europa League as they are determined based on final positions in domestic standings.

In a statement released after the 20 teams met by video conference, the league said it voted to advance funds of 125 million pounds ($150 million) to clubs in the English Football League and fifth-tier National League, many of which are struggling to cope with the financial consequences of the suspension of matches.

It also committed 20 million pounds ($24 million) to Britain’s National Health Service.

At the end of a week when Premier League players came under growing public pressure to forego some of their salaries to help pay club staff, the league said clubs had agreed to consult players over a wage deduction or deferral of 30% “in the face of substantial and continuing losses.”

“The league will be in regular contact with the Professional Footballers’ Association,” read the statement, “and the union will join a meeting which will be held tomorrow between the league, players and club representatives.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Eales says MLS is more fortunate than other leagues around the world that play the traditional fall-to-spring schedule and may have trouble completing their seasons in such a compressed time frame.

MLS was just two weeks into its season when play was halted March 12 because of the pandemic. The league has set a tentative return date of May 10, though the growing death toll in the United States could force that date to be pushed back.

Eales says everything is on the table, including the possibility of resuming league play in empty stadiums.

“We’re fortunate that we had just started our season,” he said Monday during a teleconference with Atlanta media. “We have the whole calendar year to reschedule the games we missed. The emphasis is on playing all 34 games plus the playoffs.”

MLS will likely schedule more midweek games and push back its MLS Cup championship game into mid-December in a bid to play a full season, according to Eales. He added that the playoffs could begin in mid-November — around the time MLS had been planning its title game.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The spread of the coronavirus is dominating the news and has halted pretty much all of North American sports.

But talking about soccer — and sports in general — can be a pleasant and worthwhile distraction that allows fans to shift their minds to something more fun. That’s something Fire TV analyst Tony Meola is witnessing from his role on SiriusXM FC’s ‘‘Counter Attack.’’

‘‘Our talk on the radio is just hopefully to give people a couple of hours of an opportunity to listen to something, if they have the time, to get away from everything that you see on TV,’’ Meola told the Sun-Times. ‘‘There are still soccer stories there. People still want to know how teams are getting on and how they’re dealing with all of this.’’

In late March, the soccer chatter should be about the exploits of national teams as they prepare for their next tournaments or qualifying for a big event. European leagues are hitting their crescendos as spring approaches, and the season is just getting started in the United States.

But thanks to the coronavirus, news stories are different. The questions are about whether European leagues can award trophies and how those seasons can finish. In the United States, the Major League Soccer season has been paused and the Fire still are waiting to make their return to Soldier Field.

Of course, there aren’t any games to discuss and most news developments are related to the pandemic. ‘‘Counter Attack’’ is using the time without matches to look back at the first 25 years of MLS. And Meola, a U.S. soccer luminary who was the starting goalie in two World Cups, is grateful for the ability to talk soccer in this unprecedented and scary situation.

‘‘It’s definitely a nice diversion from what we’re doing personally here every day,’’ he said. ‘‘There are not many people that have the outlet to really enjoy very much. I love the game so much. I love knowing what’s going on in the world of soccer.’’

The games eventually will return, and Meola eventually will get back to talking about what’s happening on the field. He’ll be able to analyze how the Fire are doing under coach Raphael Wicky and whether all their new acquisitions are coming together in what is an incredibly important season for the franchise.

His voice, already known from his career in soccer broadcasting, eventually will feel more familiar on the Fire’s WGN-TV and ESPN+ broadcasts. Meola also will get back to working with frequent partner and Fire play-by-play announcer Tyler Terens, then with Arlo White when his schedule allows.

When that’s happening is unclear. Meola, however, is eager for the restart.

‘‘I can’t wait to call a live game,’’ Meola said. ‘‘I can’t wait to analyze a Champions League game on the radio. I can’t wait to get back in the booth and do a Fire game, an MLS game. That’s the most fun you have in this business. I’m looking forward to that day.’’",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Nearly 2,500 fans of visiting Spanish club Valencia also traveled to that Champions League match.

More than a month later, experts are pointing to the Feb. 19 game as one of the biggest reasons why Bergamo has become one of the epicenters of the coronavirus pandemic — a “biological bomb” was the way one respiratory specialist put it — and why 35% of Valencia’s team became infected.

The match, which local media have dubbed “Game Zero,” was held two days before the first case of locally transmitted COVID-19 was confirmed in Italy.

“We were mid-February so we didn’t have the circumstances of what was happening,” Bergamo Mayor Giorgio Gori said this week during a live Facebook chat with the Foreign Press Association in Rome. “If it’s true what they’re saying that the virus was already circulating in Europe in January, then it’s very probable that 40,000 Bergamaschi in the stands of San Siro, all together, exchanged the virus between them. As is possible that so many Bergamaschi that night got together in houses, bars to watch the match and did the same.

“Unfortunately, we couldn’t have known. No one knew the virus was already here,” the mayor added. “It was inevitable.”

Less than a week after the game, the first cases were reported in the province of Bergamo.

At about the same time in Valencia, a journalist who traveled to the match became the second person infected in the region, and it didn’t take long before people who were in contact with him also had the virus, as did Valencia fans who were at the game.

While Atalanta announced its first positive case Tuesday for goalkeeper Marco Sportiello, Valencia said more than a third of its squad got infected, “despite the strict measures adopted by the club” after the match in Milan.

As of Tuesday, nearly 7,000 people in the province of Bergamo had tested positive for COVID-19 and more than 1,000 people had died from the virus — making Bergamo the most deadly province in all of Italy for the pandemic. The Valencia region had more than 2,600 people infected.

Luca Lorini, the head of the intensive care unit at the Pope John XXIII hospital in Bergamo, currently has 88 patients under his care with the coronavirus; not including many more in other parts of the hospital.

“I’m sure that 40,000 people hugging and kissing each other while standing a centimeter apart — four times, because Atalanta scored four goals (the final result was 4-1) — was definitely a huge accelerator for contagion,” Lorini told The Associated Press on Wednesday.

“Right now we’re at war. When peace time comes, I can assure you we will go and see how many of the 40,000 people who went to the game became infected,” Lorini added. “Right now we have other priorities.”

Silvio Brusaferro, the head of Italy’s Superior Institute of Health, said over the weekend at the nightly nationally televised briefing by the civil protection agency that the game was “one of the hypotheses” being evaluated as a source of the crisis in Bergamo.

“It’s certainly an analysis that can be made,” Brusaferro said.

By last week, Bergamo’s cemetery became so overwhelmed by the number of dead that military trucks began transporting bodies to a neighboring region for cremation.

Italy remained the European country with the most cases, nearly 70,000, and with almost 7,000 deaths — the most worldwide and more than twice as many as China.

Spain is the next country in Europe with the most cases, nearly 48,000, and it has surpassed China in the number of deaths with more than 3,400.

More than 435,000 people worldwide have been infected and the number of dead closed in on 20,000, according to the running count kept by Johns Hopkins University. Overall, more than 100,000 have recovered.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.

The official attendance for the Feb. 19 game was 45,792 — a “home” record for Atalanta, a small club making its debut in Europe’s top club competition.

Atalanta captain Alejandro “Papu” Gómez told Argentine daily Olé it was “terrible” to have played that game.

“It’s a city of 120,000 people and that day (40,000) went to the San Siro,” the Argentine said. “It was a historic match for Atalanta, something unique. To give you an idea, my wife took three hours to get to Milan, when that trip normally takes 40 minutes.”

The game was played in Milan because Atalanta’s stadium in Bergamo didn’t meet the requirements set by European soccer governing body UEFA.

Before the match, Valencia fans freely roamed around Milan and gathered at some of the city’s plazas, including the Piazza del Duomo, drinking and chanting team songs.

Looking back, the conditions for virus contagion were high, with thousands of people gathering without much concern — at a time when the outbreak in Europe wasn’t yet known — and then traveling back home. Nearly 30 busloads of fans made the 60-kilometer (37-mile) trip from Bergamo to Milan.

The evening before the match, there was no social distancing as officials from both clubs mingled and exchanged gifts and handshakes at a gala dinner offered by Atalanta.

“I have heard a lot (of theories), I’ll say mine: Feb. 19, 40,000 Bergamaschi went to San Siro for Atalanta-Valencia,” Fabiano di Marco, the chief pneumologist at the hospital in Bergamo, told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. “In buses, cars, trains. A biological bomb, unfortunately.”

Valencia defender Ezequiel Garay was the first Spanish league player to test positive for COVID-19. The team played a Spanish league game against Alavés about two weeks after the game in Milan, and later Alavés reported that 15 people in the club were infected, though it did not say the cases were directly related to the match against Valencia.

Italian soccer players’ association president Damiano Tommasi believes sports authorities should look long and hard at the Atalanta match before restarting leagues.

“Look at what’s happening in China, where players are testing positive for the coronavirus now — despite all the safety rules and precautions being taken,” Tommasi told the AP, referring to a recent positive test for former Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini with Chinese club Shandong Lunen.

Fellaini’s positive test was alarming because, while the outbreak began spreading in China, the virus has reportedly been receding there.

“It’s not going to be enough to just test the athletes,” Tommasi added. “The entire setting needs to be safe. Because if one team is stuck, it blocks the entire system.”

After winning the first leg, Atalanta advanced to the Champions League quarterfinals following another victory in the second leg on March 10, which was played in an empty Mestalla Stadium in Valencia after Spanish authorities prohibited games involving teams from northern Italy to be played with fans. A few thousand Valencia supporters gathered at the Mestalla to welcome the team, though, and to watch the match together in nearby bars and restaurants.

Over the past month, Atalanta has mourned the deaths of five former staff members. While announcements on the club website made no mention of the virus, local media have reported that at least four of them died with COVID-19.

Still, only one positive test from Atalanta has been announced.

“Some squads have chosen not to test their players unless they show symptoms,” Tommasi said. “Other squads tested everyone. These are individual choices.

“The head of the civil protection agency has talked about the likelihood that for every proven positive case there are probably 10 actual positives. … The high number of positives at Valencia makes you wonder.”

With the Champions League suspended because of the pandemic, Atalanta has no idea when it might play in the quarterfinals — which again would be the club’s biggest game in its history. In the meantime, both the Bergamo team and Valencia are left wondering about the unforeseen effects of their match in February.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

It was expected to draw more than 40,000 fans, and some of those supporters were coming in from distant locales.

But due to concerns over the spread of the novel coronavirus, that celebration is on hold. And fans from abroad won’t be able to come to Chicago and be on the lakefront today for what would’ve been a key moment in the Fire rebuild.

“When I knew that MLS postponed the game, I knew the trip wasn’t going to happen, but it honestly took me two days to actually say the words ‘I’m going to cancel the trip,’” said Fire fan Michael Giacometti, who moved to England in 2015 and hasn’t been back to Chicago since. “I told everybody I feel deflated. It feels like a real gut punch. I need some time to get it through my head and come to terms with the fact that I’m not going to be able to make this trip because I’ve been looking forward to it since I booked it in December.”

Because of travel arrangements, Giacometti is instead looking to come back for the Sept. 26 match against Montreal, which for now is scheduled to be the home finale. Nobody knows for sure when the home opener will actually come, and how that will come about.

The Fire are still looking forward to the opener, but like everybody else, they can’t know when.

“There is a lot of excitement about our first match back at Soldier Field,” Fire president Nelson Rodríguez told the Sun-Times. “Fans from 35 states, from as close as Indiana to as far away as Hawaii, and 12 different countries, from the U.K. to New Zealand, purchased tickets for today. Everyone understands that current circumstances will keep us from celebrating this weekend, but our Homecoming will still be held. When that day comes, we will find ways to make it even more special for all Chicago and all Fire fans.”

For Giacometti, his trip indeed would’ve been a homecoming. He would have seen old friends, connected with new ones, and been able to judge firsthand the progress of the Fire. For friends and Craig Broughton of Edinburgh, Scotland, the trip would’ve been a chance to see the team in person, and also pay tribute to Wilson’s late wife.

In August, Wilson’s wife Siobhan died. Wilson said Siobhan always wanted him to see a Fire game in Chicago, so he decided to go with Broughton. Wilson was the best man at Broughton’s wedding, and the two picked the home opener as the game they wanted to see.

“We were buzzing to finally get to see the Fire live,” Broughton wrote via email. “We received personal video messages (from) players saying they were looking forward to meeting us. It was a dream come true.”

After announcing a 30-day suspension last week because of the new coronavirus, the league said Thursday it will follow last weekend’s recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to not hold events involving more than 50 people for eight weeks.

“MLS remains focused on playing the entire 2020 season and is evaluating all options, including pushing back the end of the season and playing MLS Cup in December, as the league did prior to the 2019 season,” the league said in a statement.

The MLS championship game had been scheduled for Nov 7.

On its website, the league announced the May 10 target for a return date.

Teams have played two matches in their 34-game, regular-season league schedule. The Fire, which returned to Soldier Field this season, was to have its home opener Saturday against Atlanta United.

MLS held its championship in December from 2012-18, then cut the length of its playoffs last year by changing the earlier rounds to knockouts from a two-leg format.

Last year’s title game was Nov. 10.

UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin says the spreading coronavirus “makes football and all life in Europe quite impossible.”

UEFA plans to play the tournament next year from June 11 to July 11. The 24-team competition is being hosted in 12 different countries.

South American soccer body CONMEBOL said the Copa America tournament in Colombia and Argentina will be played the same dates as the postponed European Championship.

“It is an extraordinary measure for an unexpected situation, and it answers the fundamental need to avoid an exponential development of the virus, which is already present in all countries that are members of the confederation,” CONMEBOL President Alejandro Domínguez said in a statement.

The last Copa America was played in Brazil in 2019 and won by the hosts. This year’s edition was expected to open a new era with the tournament every four years, at the same time as the European Championship.

CONMEBOL had already suspended its club competitions, the Copa Libertadores and the Copa Sudamericana, because of the outbreak.

The postponement clears space to give national leagues and the Champions League and Europa League a chance to finish their seasons by June 30.

It is thought to have been the first U.S. sporting event to be held without fans because of the coronavirus crisis.

Less than a week later, there is little to watch in person or from the couch — the sports world having been largely shut down.

A dizzying Thursday hit fans, athletes and all others involved with the games we enjoy, play in and write about seemingly from all sides.

The NHL put its season on indefinite hold, following the lead of the NBA. Major League Baseball canceled all remaining spring-training games, delayed Opening Day by at least two weeks and postponed qualifying games for the 2020 World Baseball Classic.

‘‘Early questions from players: Do we go home now? Stay [in Arizona] and train? How/when do we start back up? . . . Do we still get paid?’’ Cubs infielder Jason Kipnis tweeted.

The XFL canceled the rest of its regular season. NASCAR announced it will proceed as scheduled but without fans in attendance. On the PGA and LPGA tours and on both major tennis tours, events were postponed or canceled.

High school basketball showcases such as the McDonald’s All-American Game and the Jordan Brand Classic were called off, as were many spring games in college football.

And no one was hit harder than college athletes in the winter and spring sports. The NCAA canceled all remaining championships, including the men’s and women’s basketball tournaments. This came one day after the NCAA had announced that March Madness would go on without fans at the games.

‘‘These last 24 hours have been heartbreaking,’’ Illinois athletic director Josh Whitman said in a statement.

DePaul’s and Northwestern’s women’s basketball teams will miss out on the Big Dance. The Illinois men’s team won’t get to end a six-season NCAA drought after all. Careers instantly ended for all those teams’ seniors. Dreams instantly disappeared for all those players. Fans — especially the long-suffering ones of the Illini — are left without the chance to write the names of their schools into their brackets.

All that opportunity and reward for so much hard work were lost.

‘‘We took away those moments for a significant number of our student-athletes,’’ Whitman said. ‘‘I know they are devastated. I am, as well.’’

The ACC, Big East, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC postponed all competition at least through the end of March. The Big Ten went the furthest of all the major conferences, canceling all games in all sports through the end of the academic year.

Former Michigan basketball coach John Beilein searched for a positive, describing it as a teachable moment.

‘‘When the basketball stops bouncing, what do you got?’’ he said. ‘‘Well, the basketball stopped bouncing. What type of life are you living? What type of values do you have? This is the good stuff that we could use to teach going forward.’’

On Thursday morning, the IHSA announced its games, including the boys state basketball tournaments, would go on with attendance limits. By evening, though, the high school basketballs had stopped bouncing, too, with all remaining tournament games having been canceled.

And what of Olympic hopefuls eyeing the Summer Games set to open July 24 in Tokyo? The future is in doubt for them, too.

As the NBA worked toward a formal announcement on an initial timetable, Jazz All-Stars Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert were being treated after testing positive for the coronavirus. Gobert’s positive test came Wednesday, leading the NBA to suspend its season almost immediately.

On Monday, Gobert, unaware of his infection, jokingly touched phones and recording devices belonging to a group of reporters. A video of that ominous scene has since made the rounds.

‘‘I was careless and make no excuse,’’ Gobert wrote Thursday on his Instagram page. ‘‘I hope my story serves as a warning and causes everyone to take this seriously.’’

Tweeted LeBron James: ‘‘What we really need to cancel is 2020.’’

Fast food giant McDonald’s says it will introduce several new safety standards once dine-in rooms reopen to protect customers and workers from the spread of the virus.

The restaurant said it will close some seating and tables to encourage social distancing, and require employees to wear masks and gloves. When eating inside one of McDonald’s restaurants, employees will deliver food to a customer’s table in a double-folded bag.

McDonald’s said it will also clean restaurants more frequently. Play Places will remain closed and restaurants will modify “dine-in beverage procedures” to limit contact. Restaurants will also include signs to advise customers on proper social distancing.

“As our daily routines continue to evolve, we remain committed to safely serving you and our local neighborhoods around the country,” said McDonald’s USA president Joe Erlinger in a statement. ”We look forward to welcoming you back into our dining rooms, when the timing is right and with these extra precautions in place.”

The company said the new procedures will apply to all 14,000 McDonald’s locations in the U.S.

South Africa stopped all sales of alcohol when its lockdown came into effect on March 27 and the brewery has seen beer pile up at its production facilities. The brewer is seeking special permission from government to move the beer to other storage facilities. The transport of alcohol has also been outlawed in South Africa.

SAB told news station eNCA on Thursday that if it’s not able to move the beer, which amounts to about 130 million liters (34 million gallons), it’ll be forced to “discard” it at a loss of about $8 million. That loss would put 2,000 jobs at risk, SAB said.

It would also be frustrating news for millions of thirsty South African beer drinkers who are going without.

South Africa is one of just a handful of countries that have prohibited alcohol sales as part of its fight against the coronavirus. India and Thailand also had bans on alcohol sales, but recently lifted their restrictions. Panama and Sri Lanka still have bans in place.

The South African government has also banned the sales of cigarettes in the lockdown and has been criticized over its hard-line approach.

Prof. Salim Abdool Karim, one of the government’s top health advisers in the COVID-19 pandemic, defended the alcohol ban at a briefing with reporters on Wednesday. He said alcohol is a significant contributing factor to violent crime and road accidents in South Africa and banning its sale has reduced pressure on medical services.

J.B. Pritzker was urged Thursday to relax his five-step plan to re-open Illinois — by allowing restaurants to open at 25% capacity on June 1 with strict safeguards for their employees.

Illinois Restaurant Association President Sam Toia said without changes, Pritzker’s plan would have a devastating impact on restaurants and bars because it would force them to wait until June 28 at the earliest to re-open to dine-in customers.

Instead, Toia proposed restaurants be allowed to move to Phase 3 on June 1 and relax restrictions every 14 days, instead of waiting 28 days between phases.

“We would have a lot of restrictions. Personal protective equipment. Face coverings. Social distancing. Taking the temperature of employees when they come in to work,” Toia said.

“June 1 is still three weeks away. ... Indiana, Texas, Arizona, Georgia and Tennessee are open. Let’s see if they have a spike. If they do, OK. If they don’t, I would really urge the governor to look at letting us re-open with 25% or less capacity, then use the 14-day model and, hopefully, by mid-June be at 50% capacity.”

Toia acknowledged restaurants operate on razor-thin margins and “economic models don’t work on 25% capacity.”

But, with restaurants literally fighting for survival, he’s willing to take what he can get.

“If we wait until the end of June, it will be 16 weeks that 50% or more of the restaurants in the city of Chicago have been closed and [the other] 50% are 80% down in sales. I don’t think there is any economic model out there that says you can stay in business” in that situation, Toia said.

“The further we go, the harder it is gonna be for restaurants to re-open. The National Restaurant Association is predicting that 20% of the restaurants won’t re-open. That’s basically looking at the end of May. If we go `til the end of June, it could be 45% or more of restaurants that never re-open. And restaurants are the soul of every neighborhood in Chicago,” Toia said.

“The governor understands the desire to open up sectors of our economy as quickly as possible because he shares that same sense of urgency,” said Jordan Abudayyeh, Pritzker’s press secretary. But, she added, “the state’s five-phase plan was put together by health experts and lays groundwork for how we move forward with a new normal. From day one, the governor has relied on science and data to drive the response to this deadly virus and staying on this course will continue to save lives.”

The governor’s plan has been criticized for being too conservative, moving too slowly between phases and setting too many hurdles to get there.

Although he divided the state into four regions, each authorized to re-open on its own timeline — based on positive test results, hospital admissions for COVID-19 symptoms and ICU beds and ventilators — no region could move to the next phase without waiting 28 days.

And none could return to normal until there is either a vaccine for the coronavirus or widely available treatment. That means no gatherings larger than 50. No conventions at McCormick Place. No major festivals like Lollapalooza and Taste of Chicago. And no major sporting events with fans in attendance.

Schools, restaurants, bars, movie theaters and gyms would have to wait until Phase 4 — June 28 at the earliest — to open, and even then would have strict limits on capacity.

Business groups and their allies in the Illinois General Assembly are concerned that, by the time various regions meet those hurdles, scores of businesses already will close for good, taking thousands of jobs with them.

That’s Toia’s argument in a nutshell.

“Governor Cuomo has been at the forefront just as much as Governor Pritzker has. But why is New York using a 14-day period to move between phases and we’re using a 28-day period?” he said.

But how willing will customers be to return to restaurant dining?

“If we’re only opening with 25% or less capacity, I think people will come. I don’t think everybody will run out. But enough people will. … It’s all about cash-flow,” Toia said.

A mayoral appointee to the Zoning Board of Appeals, Toia said he has talked to Mayor Lori Lightfoot “and her team” about his plan.

“The mayor wants to see what the governor is gonna do. But the mayor is trying to be very progressive with us. There’s communication going on about maybe closing some streets for outside dining with the tables on the street. That way, we could have social distancing,” Toia said.

“There’s no question that she wants to think outside the box about how we help these restaurants throughout our 77 communities stay viable as we move ahead.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

At a virtual meeting Thursday, the City Council’s License Committee turned its attention to those establishments.

At the behest of Ald. Brendan Reilly (42nd), the License Committee agreed to let downtown Chicago’s outdoor patios and rooftop gardens stay open until midnight this spring, summer and fall — if they’re lucky enough to come back at all.

For years, Reilly has sought that extra hour to accommodate international travelers who love to stay out late. International travel is virtually non-existent and likely to remain a sliver of what it was until there’s a coronavirus vaccine.

But rooftop garden and outdoor patio business is poised for a comeback, as soon as the shackles are lifted, making that extra hour of business all the more important.

“This is an annual exercise. I’m asking members to once again extend these hours to the hospitality industry — assuming that they are back in business in time to use their patios this year. Assuming that folks will eventually be back to work,” Reilly said.

“This is one more way we can support an industry that is struggling terribly right now with the stay-at-home order and all of the measures we are taking to protect public health. … We also need to provide these businesses the ability to make some extra revenue by adding that extra hour during warm weather months.”

Illinois Restaurant Association President Sam Toia called the ordinance “a solid move” for a struggling industry and predicted big crowds for outdoor patios and rooftop gardens.

“You can exercise social distancing. They just would be more comfortable out in fresh air than outside,” Toia said.

Downtown Ald. Brian Hopkins (2nd) said he, too, supports the extra hour. But like Reilly, Hopkins wants to maintain the annual review to keep noise under control at places like the hotel in his ward that’s “surrounded on all sides by residential condo towers.”

“Bars and restaurants that have patios, that have outdoor spaces, that have cafes and rooftops — they’re going to be doing more business than bars and restaurants that don’t have outdoor spaces because people are just gonna feel more comfortable. It’s generally safer in an outdoor environment right now with an airborne virus still lurking out there,” Hopkins said.

“Given that, we can anticipate bigger crowds on rooftops, which means more noise. We want them to open. We want them to make money. We want the servers to return to their jobs. But that doesn’t mean we can stop trying to keep some peace so the neighbors don’t complain.”

Noise control was also the driving force behind another Hopkins-championed ordinance approved by the License Committee.

For bars and restaurants violating the ban on live or amplified music at outdoor patios and rooftop gardens, the minimum fine would be increased to $400, though the never-imposed maximum would drop to $1,000 from $5,000.

“I had some patios that were getting such a crowd for their outdoor facility with music, they treated the fines as just a cost of doing business. They had such a good thing going, they said, ‘We’ll just keep violating it and paying the fines.’ I had to do something to increase the incentive to not break the rules,” Hopkins said.

“If you’re outside, the chances are much lower that you’re gonna be exposed to the virus. ... In recognition of that, bars are gonna want to market their outdoor spaces — and that’s fine. There’s no reason why they can’t have crowds returning to their patios and rooftops and still be good neighbors.”

The License Committee also approved a Reilly-championed ordinance prohibiting peddling in parts of River North, the Gold Coast and Near North neighborhoods.

Reilly said the ordinance addresses “some chronic issues we’ve had on very specific blocks and streets. ....It’s not a blanket prohibition for the ward. It’s just a handful of corridors.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The 6-foot-4, 300-pound rising senior has stumbled a few times in college sports’ version of Weight Watchers, with no in-person classes or spring practices.

“Maybe I would get Taco Bell because I do like Taco Bell,” Brown said. “Or maybe I’ll have ice cream later at night. … The meals that are maybe not super-nutritious, I’ve been trying to keep that to one a day.”

Athletes have been displaced from facilities with well-stocked training tables and easy access to healthy snacks and protein shakes. Some are home with family members, while others are largely on their own in off-campus residences.

To help them, schools have provided care packages, grocery tips, recipes and even cooking demonstrations on social media. And nutritionists or dietitians at schools — there are 96 with at least one on staff, according to the College and Professional Sports Dietitians Association, with roughly two-thirds in the Power Five conferences — have consulted with athletes from afar.

The challenge is keeping athletes — already engaged in makeshift workout regimens — on track when it comes to adding strength or avoiding unwanted pounds, even as it remains unclear when they can return to campuses or whether they’ll play this fall as the country tries to reopen.

“For some of them, it’s really good that they’re home, because they do have someone that’s still making home-cooked meals for them,” said Rachel Lukowski, Iowa State’s director of sports nutrition for football. “And some don’t have that, so it’s a matter of, ‘OK, here’s how we can help you out here’ or ‘What can we do?’”

Nebraska has offered curbside-pickup meals for athletes near campus and Memphis sent 225 care packages containing items such as snacks and protective masks to its athletes in mid-April.

Lukowski said Iowa State’s care packages included protein powder along with bottles allowing athletes to mix their own shakes without a blender, as well as grocery lists with tips for shopping for healthy foods on a budget and what to stash in the pantry. The school also posted cooking tips and recipes such as chicken dishes, egg muffins and pancakes, among others.

Oregon State sports dietitian Toni Langhans has tried similar steps with the school’s “Quarantine Kitchen Series” on Instagram. She wants athletes to feel comfortable in the kitchen by making dishes such as overnight oatmeal, stuffed peppers, black bean burgers or homemade hummus instead of ordering daily takeout meals.

“It’s such a big important skill to work on that really affects the athlete’s overall relationship with food, and what they’re going to eat when they come back also,” Langhans said. “So that’s what we’re trying to push for in doing these demos and trying to give people recipes — something that’s easy to look at and say, ‘OK yeah, I think I can do that.’ … Sometimes quality food can take three minutes.”

Things have gone smoothly so far for Duke defensive end Chris Rumph II. He’s trying to strengthen his 6-3 frame while living with his parents in Knoxville, Tennessee, and has picked up 6 pounds (233) thanks largely to his mother’s cooking.

“We haven’t even left the house, so all I’m getting is home-cooked meals, protein and all that kind of stuff,” said Rumph, son of an assistant coach with the NFL’s Houston Texans. “So there’s no fast food. I haven’t had fast food in ... I think two months.”

Washington State offensive lineman Liam Ryan is staying in a house near the Pullman campus with roommates. They’ve been grilling so much steak, chicken, pork chops and salmon that they recently ran out of propane and had to get more.

The 6-5, 300-pound Ryan has focused on eating vegetables, brown rice and snacks like beef jerky or nuts. He’s also been checking the scales to ensure he’s staying near his playing weight.

“I think you just have to stay persistent on what you do because if you’re kind of just slacking and you miss a meal or you don’t work out — I mean, that’s what they do at the next level,” Ryan said. “At the NFL, the offseason’s kind of by yourself. So you get a little taste of it right now.”

Still, it’s hard to fight every craving for athletes removed from the hour-filling campus routines of weight training, practices and study hall. Ryan had a strong one for Chips Ahoy cookies, so he picked up multiple packages, then threw several cookies in a bowl with milk as though eating cereal.

“O-lineman stuff, right there,” he quipped.

Back at Nevada, Brown understands that challenge. He views it all as a test of “practicing self-control” when choosing what to bring home from the grocery store or picking up takeout from restaurants.

And yes, he has succumbed to the junk-food temptation. But when he has, he makes sure the next meal is a better one.

“At some point everybody’s going to come back,” Brown said. “I think the athletes that were able to eat well and really take care of their nutrition are going to be some of the athletes in better shape and be able to perform better. That’s really what it comes down to.”

J.B. Pritzker ordered the state’s bars and restaurants to close to dine-in customers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Outside of attending college at DePaul University, Rucker has never truly left Hyde Park.

Attending Shoesmith and William H. Ray elementary schools, and Kenwood Academy, along with opening up the eatery on 53rd Street (the neighborhood’s business epicenter) has earned her the nickname “Mz. Hyde Park.”

Since the executive order took effect, however, she says she has lost 80% of her business.

“We have been able to stay open every day so far; free delivery service is currently keeping the business afloat,” said Rucker. “So I have been able to keep most of my staff with full-time positions.

“I had a straight business plan for dining and carryout delivery service and I had to revamp my whole system within less than 30 days when they came down with a stay-at-home order. So far, I have been able to keep the business open; that is my community.”

On Wednesdays, Soul Shack gives free meals to Hyde Park’s homeless community. The meal consists of fried chicken and two sides — called “South Sides.”

“Typically, it’s normally for the people that are in the area; we pretty much know who they are,” said Rucker. “So it’s normally like a maximum of maybe 10 people that come in on Wednesdays. … I typically do that all the time, but now it has increased.”

While some restaurants have shuttered temporarily due to the pandemic, there are others with owners who plan to stay open for as long as they can. Those owned by African American women are getting crushed particularly hard as the economy reels from the new carryout/delivery/pickup-only reality. Restaurant owners are creating new ways to weather the pandemic.

Lexington Betty’s Smoke House co-owner Dominique Leach is no stranger to dealing with catastrophe.

Leach, a Humboldt Park native, started her business with a food truck — which was later set on fire. The pandemic has more recently caused her to shut down two locations on the South (the Pullman location reopened Friday) and West Sides (Austin), along with cutting back on hours when she reopened them.

“Unfortunately, this came at a time where we were really getting some recognition for our hard work,” said Leach. “And, you know, I can only be optimistic. And we’re just happy enough to be getting enough revenue to at least keep the bills paid We’ve come down from 14 employees to just myself, my wife, who’s the other owner, and one employee.

“We have one driver working with the helper with deliveries. … and it’s just enough to get by. And we’re happy to have that — it could be a lot worse. And so I’m going to take the positives and be optimistic about the future.”

During the pandemic, Lexington Betty’s Smoke House has donated meals to Rush University Medical Center employees and 5th District police officers.

“Just know that we’re all in this together, and when we reopen, we’ll celebrate with the community and we just hope to get everybody’s support. We’ll be here at the end of this,” said Leach.

Due to the pandemic, Annah Mitchell, owner of Gobble Doggs, a turkey hotdog-centric food truck, had to temporarily shutter her LaSalle Street Metra station kiosk and cease construction of a restaurant she planned to open. Last year, her business launched a scholarship — raising funds via tips — for young entrepreneurs.

With her truck temporarily out of service amid COVID-19, she’s made the pivot to driving for the online grocery delivery service Instacart, and taking orders for catering.

“I’ve been doing anything that I possibly can,” said Mitchell. “I certainly want to make sure that the business stays on people’s minds and we’re continuing to market the business.”

Mitchell is determined to not let the pandemic take her livelihood away.

“This is a self-financed business and so everything that I’ve put into this business is mine — the blood, the money, the sweat, the tears,” said Mitchell. “So when I look at everything that I have put on the line for this, I cannot lose. I refuse to lose; I can’t let this go. This means too much to me … I cannot let this go.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Twenty-one farms in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan are the recipients of grants between $400 and $12,000, to help with operations during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I can’t think of a more crucial time to support family farmers. As grocery shoppers see disruptions in the national food supply chain, more people are turning to local sources for their food. We know our grant program will bolster the efforts of those hardworking farmers and make more good food available in the Chicagoland area,” said Bayless in Monday’s official announcement.

More than $2.5 million in funding has been awarded to date by the foundation, one of the only grant sources to farmers, according to the official announcement.

This year’s grants will go toward a variety of farm projects/programs including the purchase of new equipment, USDA poultry processing designations, pasture fencing and other improvements.

“All of this year’s grant winners said the money will help alleviate some of the troubles facing small farms, which rely on a customer base of restaurants and farmers’ markets,” the statement said.

Bayless helms nine Chicago restaurants including Frontera Grill, Topolobampo, Xoco, Lena Brava and Cruz Blanca Brewery and Taqueria.

The kits come with two seasoned, breaded, and pressure-cooked chicken fillets, marinara sauce, Italian-style cheeses, and creamy garlic and lemon pasta.

Customers can choose Original Chicken, Grilled or Spicy fillets. Meal kits are available at participating Chick-fil-A restaurants via the drive-thru, the Chick-fil-A app, DoorDash, Uber Eats and Grubhub.

Chick-fil-A’s meal kits come amid the sudden shift from restaurant dining to at-home eating prompted by the pandemic, coupled with panic buying at grocery stores.

“Due to changes in our restaurant landscape over the past two months, we decided to resurface and fast track the Meal Kit concept to meet our guest’s current needs,” said Ben Bolling, menu and packaging program lead at Chick-fil-A.

Co-owners Abraham Conlon and Adrienne Lo announced the restaurant’s closure Tuesday, and according to media reports, they will re-open a meals kit-only marketplace on Wednesday.

The new Super Fat Rice Mart will occupy the former restaurant’s location at 2957 W. Diversey.

The meal kits — available for pickup-only — will feature produce, spices, grains as well as prepared items, along with step-by-step instructions for at-home cooking, and will start at $100. Pick-up hours are 4 to 7 p.m. Friday, and 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.

The restaurant’s website posted a message to patrons late Tuesday, which read, in part:

“Super Fat Rice Mart allows customers and guests to experience the food of Fat Rice in many new and exciting ways! Super Fat Rice Mart is a specialty cooking store offering Fat Rice at-home cook kits along with organic and local produce, Portuguese imports, beers and wine offerings, a wide array of fun, Asian pantry items and take-away favorites all with that fun Fat Rice flair!”

The restaurant has been closed to dine-in patrons since March when Illinois non-essential businesses were ordered closed by Gov. J.B. Pritzker due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In an interview with the New York Times, Conlon said, “The restaurant for the foreseeable future is dead. We need to face the reality that we can’t exist in the future as it looks now. People are not going to feel comfortable being in close quarters or being in a cramped dining room.”

Conlon and Lo are James Beard Award-winners for the Portuguese/Macanese restaurant, which had been operating since 2012.

In 2018 in Chicago, after receiving James Beard honors for best chef Great Lakes Region, Conlon was emotional when he spoke about his critically acclaimed eatery, backstage at the gala ceremony. “I’m amazed, I’m humbled … I’m happy for my team, for Adrienne, for everyone who stands behind me every day that really puts in the hard work of waking up, going in there, cooking the food, serving the food, serving the wine.

Unlike some germs, there’s no indication the coronavirus can spread through food, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The biggest concern remains person-to-person contact. Contactless delivery, in which the order is left outside the recipient’s door, reduces that risk.

For take-out, the FDA advises restaurant workers and customers to stay at least six feet from others.

The risk from packaging is “likely very low,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Luckily, Ikea, Disney Parks, Cheesecake Factory and several other restaurants are pulling back the curtain on some of their iconic dishes, so people can make them from the comfort of quarantine.

Here are official make-your-own recipes of famous dishes that you can enjoy until it’s safe to venture out for the real thing.

Ikea’s famous meatballs

Though many may know IKEA for its home furniture, the company also sells food and beverages in its in-store cafeterias.

In classic IKEA fashion, the company released its meatball recipe in the form of a construction diagram on Twitter. The directions reveal how to make the meatballs, as well as the “iconic Swedish cream sauce” that accompanies them, for four people.

Disney Parks’ famous Dole Whip

When many people think of Disneyland and the Walt Disney World Resort, the taste of pineapple Dole Whip, a soft-serve ice cream sold outside the classic Enchanted Tiki Room, may also come to mind.

Though the Tiki Room isn’t taking visitors right now, the Disney app My Disney Experience has published how to make a fruity pineapple soft serve to fill the Dole Whip void. The following recipe serves four and takes five minutes to prep. (According to a recipe on Dole’s website, the original soft serve is dairy-free, so you may want to opt for dairy-free ice cream to keep your creation authentic.)

Ingredients:

1 big scoop of ice cream

4 ounces of pineapple juice

2 cups of frozen pineapple

Directions:

Add pineapple, ice cream and juice to a blender. Start blending at low speed and increase to high speed. Blend until smooth. Make sure that lid is on tight! Use a piping bag with a star tip to create a classic swirl, or just scoop right into bowls.

Disney Parks churro bites

Another Disney dessert option is the churro bites served throughout the parks. Here’s how to make them at home, according to the Disney Parks Blog. The recipe serves four.

Ingredients:

1 cup water

8 tablespoons butter

¼ teaspoon salt

¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon, divided

1¼ cups all-purpose flour

3 eggs

1½ cups vegetable or canola oil

½ cup sugar

Directions:

Combine water, butter, salt and ¼ teaspoon cinnamon in 1½-quart saucepan over medium heat. Bring pot to rolling boil. Reduce heat to low. Add flour and stir vigorously until mix forms a ball. Remove from heat and let rest for 5-7 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, and stir until combined. Set aside. Heat oil in medium skillet or 1-quart saucepan over medium-high heat or until temperature reaches 350 degrees. Spoon dough into piping bag fitted with large star tip. Pipe 1-inch strip of dough over saucepan, cut with knife, and drop into hot oil. Repeat until churro bites fill saucepan with room to fry. Fry churro bites until golden brown. Remove with slotted spoon or mesh spider strainer. Drain churro bites on paper towel. Mix sugar and ½ teaspoon cinnamon in medium bowl. Toss in churro bites until coated. Place on serving plate and serve with favorite dipping sauce.

Toy Story Land’s grilled cheese

For National Grilled Cheese Day, the Disney Parks Blog shared how to make the grilled three-cheese sandwich offered at Woody’s Lunch Box in Disney World.

Here’s how a serving for four is done.

Cream cheese spread ingredients:

½ cup cream cheese

½ cup shredded Double Gloucester or cheddar

2 tablespoons heavy cream

¼ teaspoon coarse salt

Garlic spread ingredients:

1 cup mayonnaise

1½ teaspoons minced garlic

½ teaspoon coarse salt

Grilled three-cheese sandwich ingredients:

8 slices of artisan bread

8 cheddar cheese slices

8 provolone slices

Directions for cream cheese spread:

Combine cream cheese, Double Gloucester or cheddar, heavy cream and salt in food processor. Blend until smooth. Set aside.

Directions for garlic spread:

Combine mayonnaise, garlic and salt in small bowl and stir until blended. Set aside.

Direction for grilled three-cheese sandwich:

Lay out artisan bread slices on parchment paper or large cutting board. Place two slices of cheddar on four bread slices. Place two slices of provolone on remaining bread slices. Equally spoon cream cheese spread on slices with provolone. Gently smooth cream cheese spread over each slice. Press cheddar side and provolone side together. Heat a large skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes, until hot. Brush both sides of the sandwiches with garlic spread. Grill sandwiches for 2 minutes on each side, until cheese is melted and bread is golden brown.

McDonald’s McMuffin

The Disney Parks Blog isn’t the only place people can find famous recipes. McDonald’s UK, which closed all its locations in the United Kingdom and Ireland last month, shared on Twitter how to make a sausage and egg McMuffin.

Want to make the meal creamier while staying true to the original? Use butter instead of liquid margarine. In 2015, the fast-food chain made a key ingredient switch, announcing it would use butter instead of margarine across all its breakfast items. Before then, it had used margarine to toast biscuits and English muffins and to cook eggs.

Panera Bread dishes

Panera Bread also has made several of its recipes available online, including the chain’s Asian almond ramen salad, slow cooker chicken barley soup and game-day chili, among others.

Here’s its recipe for gemelli primavera with shrimp, for four.

Ingredients:

12 ounces dried gemelli

⅓ cup extra virgin olive oil

8 ounces thin asparagus spears, cut into 1-inch lengths on a diagonal

¾ cup fresh or frozen peas

2 scallions, thinly sliced on a diagonal

2 cloves garlic, minced

1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined, thawed if frozen

½ teaspoon salt

¼ teaspoon ground black pepper

Zest and juice of ½ lemon

⅛ cup Parmesan cheese, plus extra for garnish

4 ounces grape tomatoes, halved lengthwise

⅓ cup pitted green olives, coarsely chopped

¼ cup chopped fresh basil

½ loaf Panera Bread Three Cheese Bread, sliced and toasted

Directions:

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until tender yet chewy, 6 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of oil in large, deep skillet over medium heat. Add asparagus, peas, scallions and garlic, and cook 1 minute. Season shrimp with salt and pepper and add to pan along with lemon zest and juice. Cook until bright pink, 2 minutes. Drain pasta, reserving ¾ cup pasta water. Add pasta and pasta water to pan along with Parmesan, stirring until creamy. Stir in tomatoes, olives and 2 tablespoons of basil. Divide among plates and garnish with remaining 2 tablespoons basil and Parmesan. Serve with toasted Panera Bread Three Cheese Bread. Tip: Gemelli is a twisted short pasta, but you can use any short, shaped pasta for this dish. Try cavatappi, cut fusilli or penne instead.

Cheesecake Factory specialties

Cheesecake Factory has published recipes online for many of its dishes, including its almond-crusted salmon salad, California guacamole salad and chicken bellagio. Click here to find out how to make these tasty creations and others.

Here’s how to make the restaurant’s Cajun jambalaya pasta for two.

Ingredients:

2 ounces olive oil

1 lb. boneless/skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces

2 Tbls. Cajun spice blend

4 oz. red, yellow, green peppers, cut into thin strips

4 oz. red onions, cut into thin strips

6 oz. shrimp (shells, tails and veins removed)

1 Tbl. blanched garlic, minced

2 tsps. Cajun spice blend

½ tsp. kosher salt

¼ tsp. ground black pepper

4 oz. roma tomatoes, diced in 1-inch pieces

1½ cups spicy chicken-seafood broth

1 Tbl. chopped parsley

1 lb. linguini pasta (fresh)

Directions:

Heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan. Place the chicken into a clean mixing bowl. Sprinkle the Cajun spice over the chicken and into the bowl. Gently toss the chicken until each piece is evenly coated with the spice. Add the chicken into the sauté pan and cook until it is about half done. Add the peppers, onions and shrimp into the pan. Cook until the shrimp are about half done. Add the garlic into the pan. Season all of the ingredients with kosher salt, ground black pepper and a little more Cajun spice. Add the diced tomatoes and chicken-seafood broth into the sauté pan. Gently stir the ingredients together. Continue to cook until the chicken and shrimp are done and the vegetables are tender. Drop the pasta into boiling salted water, and cook until al dente. Place the pasta into serving bowls. Spoon the jambalaya over the pasta. Garnish with a sprinkle of freshly chopped parsley.

The Arkansas-based company said the closure of the plant in Waterloo would deny a vital market to hog farmers and further disrupt U.S. meat supply. Tyson had kept the facility, its largest pork plant, open in recent days over the objections of alarmed local officials.

The plant can process 19,500 hogs per day, accounting for 3.9% of U.S. pork processing capacity, according to the National Pork Board.

More than 180 infections have been linked to the plant and officials expect that number to dramatically rise. Testing of its 2,800 workers is expected to begin Friday. Cases and hospitalizations in Black Hawk County have skyrocketed in recent days and local officials say the plant is the source of most infections.

In addition to those who have tested positive for the virus, hundreds of workers were staying home out of fear, and the plant had been running at reduced production levels.

Employers have struggled to contain the virus in meatpacking plants, where workers toil side by side on production lines and often share crowded locker rooms, cafeterias and rides to work. While plants have added safety measures, public health experts say social distancing is virtually impossible.

Several facilities have temporarily closed due to virus outbreaks, including a Smithfield Foods plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, a JBS USA plant in Worthington, Minnesota, and a Redwood Farms Meat Processors in Estherville, Iowa. Others have stayed open or resumed production after pauses for testing and cleaning.

An estimated 25% of U.S. pork processing capacity has been closed or idled due to reduced operating speed over the past two days, said Steve Meyer, an economist with Kerns and Associates in Ames, Iowa.

As a result, prices are starting to increase and analysts warn that customers could soon see shortages of certain products at grocery stores. At the same time, hog prices are plummeting due to excess supply, devastating farmers.

In Kansas, a critical beef production state, an official said Wednesday that 168 meatpacking workers had tested positive to date. In Missouri, two rural counties that are home to several meatpacking plants reported huge spikes in infections.

Tyson Fresh Meats President Steve Stouffer said its Waterloo closure was driven by “the combination of worker absenteeism, COVID-19 cases and community concerns.” He warned of “significant ramifications” for farmers, distributors and grocers in the supply chain.

Tyson said workers would be compensated during the shutdown and that the timing of reopening would depend on several factors, including testing.

Local officials, including Waterloo Mayor Quentin Hart and the Black Hawk County Board of Health, had called on Tyson or Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds to temporarily close the plant. They had warned that its continued operation would exacerbate the spread of the virus in the area and that the company was endangering its workers.

A 65-year-old employee in the plant’s laundry department died Sunday after contracting the virus, the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reported.

The governor blocked local authorities from closing the plant in an April 16 order that banned social gatherings in northeastern Iowa. It granted the exclusive power to the Iowa Department of Public Health to shut down businesses over coronavirus concerns.

The governor and the department had been working with Tyson to keep the plant open.

Reynolds argued that the economic disruption caused by plant closures outweighed the health risks, warning that farmers might have to euthanize their pigs. She said that “people are gonna get” the virus in large workplaces but most will experience mild or no symptoms.

While it’s true that for most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up in a few weeks, it can lead to more severe illness and even death for some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems.

Lawmakers said an earlier closure would have better protected public health and been less harmful economically. “My concern is the impact this has had because we didn’t act soon enough,” said Democratic Rep. Ras Smith of Waterloo.

The governor didn’t respond directly when asked Wednesday if the state should have intervened. She defended her overall response to the crisis but said, “There’s always more we could have done.”

Wrigley Field does, too.

Outside of Chicago, every other major-league ballpark in a nation felled by the coronavirus is empty, as well. There is hope, however, that the parks will be occupied by teams — but not fans — by early July if team owners and the players’ union can agree on financial terms for what would be perhaps an 82-game season, about half the usual 162.

On Tuesday, the players and owners reportedly discussed health, safety and economics but held off on talking about the hot-button topic, the owners’ proposal for a 50/50 revenue split, a tug-of-war the sides will have to get ironed out in two or three weeks. That would be a “deadline” with a targeted July 1-4 start to the season needed, preceded by a scaled-down spring training of about three weeks.

If you’re one of the millions reeling from the physical, mental or financial effects of the pandemic and hoping for a return of baseball as soon as possible, covering your eyes and ears or shutting down your phone while this gets hashed out might be the thing to do, unless billionaires-vs.-millionaires tiffs are your cup of tea.

The last thing baseball’s image needs is a squabble between the two sides, but that’s what we’re probably going to get.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker took the owners’ side Tuesday, saying “fans deserve their pastime back” and that he is “disappointed that players are holding out for these very, very high salaries and payments during a time when I think everybody is sacrificing.”

It’s the players, though, not the owners, who would be taking health risks by playing baseball again.

When we last saw the Cubs and Sox playing on March 12, when spring training was shut down and the start of the season delayed, both teams were enthused about embarking on stepping-stone seasons, the Sox to a window of contention and the Cubs to a new era under new manager David Ross, trying to keep their closing window propped up.

If the owners and the players’ union settle on a deal, we’ll see a schedule that will keep the crosstown series intact. Each team would play opponents in its own division, plus interleague games limited to National League Central (Cubs) vs. American League Central (Sox), NL East vs. AL East and NL West vs. AL West. Seeing them on TV or listening on the radio only is likely with games being played in empty ballparks, at least initially.

Rosters will expand from 26 to 30 with “taxi squads” of up to 20 players available to reinforce rosters, playoff teams will increase from 10 to 14 and the designated hitter will be used by NL teams (new for them) as well as AL teams.

That shouldn’t be a problem for the Cubs, who have a natural DH in Kyle Schwarber.

A much tougher problem to solve is a financial meeting of the minds between owners and players. With about 40 percent of revenue coming from tickets, concessions and various gate-related cash, the owners are angling for the revenue split. The union is having none of it, calling it a salary cap. They agreed in March to prorated salaries based on games played.

“That the league is trying to take advantage of a global health crisis to get what they’ve failed to achieve in the past ... suggests they know exactly how this will be received,” MLB Players Association executive director Tony Clark told The Athletic on Monday.

“None of this is beneficial to the process of finding a way for us to safely get back on the field and resume the 2020 season — which continues to be our sole focus.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The Hall of Fame announced Wednesday that it has canceled the July 26 induction ceremony because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Instead, the class will be included at next year’s induction festivities on July 25, 2021.

Former White Sox play-by-play man Harrelson was set to be inducted as the Ford C. Frick Award winner for excellence in broadcasting as part of a class that also included former players Jeter, Walker and Ted Simmons and longtime union chief Marvin Miller.

A record crowd had been expected this summer at the small town in upstate New York to honor Jeter, the former New York Yankees captain who was elected in January by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America.

This will be the first year without an induction ceremony since 1960.

‘‘I think it’s the right thing to do, I really do,’’ Harrelson said Tuesday. ‘‘They were going to have 100,000 people there, with Yankee fans coming in from all over the world with Derek Jeter. I wouldn’t want my family going up there.’’

But it’s likely to be an eerie, lonely, made-for-television affair.

A Sox season-ticket holder, Lightfoot said a decision on when and how baseball will return will be made “at the league level,” not by individual team owners, nor by the governors and mayors of individual states and cities.

But she acknowledged having “ongoing conversations” with the owners of both teams about “what that might look like.”

“We’re obviously a ways away from that because we haven’t seen the level of cases decline on a consistent basis. We’re still seeing them rise,” the mayor said.

“But can I envision a world where baseball might return to Chicago this summer? Yes. Is it likely to be without fans? Probably.”

During a City Hall news conference called to announce a new city app tied to the pandemic, Lightfoot also was asked whether she has any intention of re-opening the lakefront as the governor’s stay-at-home order drags on through the month of May.

“I don’t anticipate doing that,” the mayor said.

Lightfoot also was asked about following the lead of New York City, which is opening 40 miles of city streets for public use.

The mayor did not answer the question directly. She simply talked about a long drive she took around the city on a bright and sunny Sunday and being pleased with what she saw in terms of people maintaining social distance.

“People seem to be doing fine. I’m not seeing overcrowding in interior parks that was a concern when we closed down the lakefront. I think people are taking this restriction on movement in stride,” she said.

“No one thinks that this is something that will go on forever. But I think people recognize [the need] because we’ve been very up-front and transparent about why it’s necessary. What a difference it’s making. How we’ve lengthened the period of time in which cases are doubling.”

As temperatures rise, spring fever spreads and cabin fever intensifies, Lightfoot said it’s imperative for the city to stay engaged, keep listening and remain “physically out there and seeing what the needs of residents are.”

“We’ll make adjustments where necessary,” she said.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Technically, the display by White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson the previous day had been, after a screaming home run to left at Guaranteed Rate Field, much more of a bat throw. Anderson was hit by a pitch from Royals starter Brad Keller in his next at-bat. Benches cleared. Expletives were hurled. Halfhearted shoves were, well, shoved. Suspensions would come for Anderson and Keller, but none of the above has a single thing to do with this story.

That same morning, Sox right-hander Lucas Giolito woke up with a sore left hamstring. He had started that game for the Sox and exited it in the third inning after suffering a mild strain that would keep him out of action for two scheduled turns on the bump.

“It wasn’t worrisome in the long term,” Giolito, 25, recalled in a phone interview from his home in Davis, California. “But it was a huge annoyance. I wanted to be in the rotation.”

The experience heightened Giolito’s awareness of what he had been doing with his plant leg when pitching. In his return May 2 with an up-and-down five innings — and a no-decision — against the Red Sox, he was softer on the left leg, bending his knee a bit more in a smoother delivery that would become a permanent part of his mechanics.

It was perhaps the final piece of his 2019 puzzle. Giolito had worked tirelessly to improve on a 2018 season in which, in 32 starts, he had the highest WHIP (1.48) in baseball and the most walks (90) and earned runs allowed (118) in the American League. He had overhauled his mechanics and dived into neurofeedback training to combat the anxiety he had felt on the mound.

He was ready to flip the script on his young big-league career, and that’s exactly what happened. Giolito busted through last season with a 14-9 record, a 3.41 ERA and a 1.06 WHIP in 29 starts. His walks plummeted to 57, and his strikeouts exploded from 125 the season before to 228. He made his first All-Star team and finished sixth in AL Cy Young Award voting.

It all started after that hammy strain. The first start was followed by eight more — all victories for Giolito — during which he threw 57⅓ innings, striking out 65 and walking only 14, with a sparkling 0.94 ERA. He entered the stretch 2-1 with a 5.30 ERA and exited it 10-1 with a 2.22 ERA. For a while there, he was the talk of the AL.

GIOLITO HAD EVERYTHING WORKING in a complete-game shutout of the Astros on May 23 in Houston. Well, “everything” might be a bit of an overstatement. His fastball and changeup were on point, as they would be throughout the nine-game winning streak. He mixed in a few successful curveballs, too, an all-too-rare occurrence. One of the curves retired Josh Reddick swinging in the sixth inning, a perfect pitch that came out of Giolito’s hand on the same plane as his fastball. The pitch didn’t have a big hump but dived straight down, nasty and unhittable.

Even better in that game was Giolito’s slider, another pitch he used on a limited basis last season because he couldn’t control it consistently. Over pancakes at home in Davis, the 2020 season on hold, Giolito watched as the Sox streamed his 107-pitch gem on YouTube. It was his first time seeing the game broadcast-style.

“Yes! That’s the slider!” he thought more than once.

The way it came out of his hand and the shape it took looked better than it had in any other game last season. Giolito was able to remember the feel he had for his slider that day, something he had lost in ensuing starts when he tried — too hard, he realizes now — to throw it.

“I want to put guys away with the curve and fool guys with sliders,” he said. “What sucks is that I was working on those things [this] spring, and it was going really well. I was feeling like, ‘I’m going to be better than I was last year.’ That’s annoying.”

The work hasn’t stopped completely. Giolito has a large net in his backyard that he pitches into, though the space he has to work with — only about 65 feet — limits what else he can do. To simulate long toss, he walks with his 2½-year-old rescue mutt to a park two blocks from home, ties Louie (“my best buddy”) to a tree, positions himself about 15 feet from the chain-link shell behind home plate of a softball field, crow-hops and fires into the back side of the shell.

One would think a 6-6 All-Star doing this in plain view at a park in a residential neighborhood would be a big draw — or at least create a curious ruckus.

“People just walk by,” he said. “They’re walking dogs, kids are skateboarding by, scootering by. Every once in a while, a kid will seem pretty curious. But I don’t think anybody knows who I am.”

WALKING THE STREETS near his and wife Ariana’s residence in downtown Chicago, Giolito got recognized a bit more often as his breakout 2019 season went on. Outside of that? Nah.

“I don’t think it’s quite there on a national level,” he said. “The White Sox haven’t won for a very long time. Obviously, Chicago is a large market, but it’s still a Cubs town.

“When they put out top-pitchers lists, things like that, on social media, a lot of times I’m not there. That’s OK. It is what it is. I had one good year. I feel like last year was just the tip of the iceberg, scratching the surface. I want to be better. That’s why it sucks that we’re not playing.”

These days, Giolito is feeding his jones for competition by participating in an online “MLB The Show 20” charity tournament that features one player from each of the 30 major-league teams. For each player, it’s a 29-game round robin — one three-inning game against each of the other participants — before a postseason that will culminate in a “World Series” on May 2 that no doubt will, ahem, captivate the masses.

Hey, that’s what’s happening.

A day before his first four games (he would beat the Marlins’ Ryne Stanek and the Blue Jays’ Bo Bichette and lose to the Braves’ Luke Jackson and the Mets’ Jeff McNeil), Giolito was looking forward to having some fun with it. In particular, he was happy for the chance to interact with fans. Part of his prep for the tournament was a marathon session — four hours — playing “The Show” while livestreaming on his personal Twitch channel.

“At one point, I had, like, 200 people watching,” he said. “That’s not a huge number, but you’ve got to grow your channel. It’s good practice — talking, reading, trying to game. You’re multitasking, but you can’t just sit there and be boring. Nobody wants to watch that.’’

Practice for what? Maybe a broadcasting career down the line. Giolito — who would be superb at it — has an “um” and “you know” habit he would like to break.

It certainly isn’t practice for pitching in 2020. A year ago at this time, he was shut down for two starts. This time, it’s painfully longer.

He hopes it won’t be too much longer.

“Man, I hope so,” he said. “It’s so hard not to be playing baseball.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

It was a weird one.

My little son, my father-in-law and I went to a spring-training game between the White Sox and Red Sox at old Ed Smith Field in Sarasota, Florida. The weird part was, there were no major-leaguers playing.

The baseball strike was raging, had been for more than a half-year. The 1994 World Series had been canceled.

And on that beautiful spring day, there was no solution in sight.

I wrote that no batters could reach the outfield wall, that we were studying somebody named Pookie Bernstine, that the beer was still nice and cold. But it was strange. Not right. Just . . . not right.

Now Major League Baseball is floating the idea of starting the 2020 season, which has been delayed by the coronavirus outbreak, sometime in May with all 30 teams in Arizona.

Talk about weird.

Games would be played before no fans in spring-training stadiums and at the Diamondbacks’ Chase Field. Players would sit six feet apart in the stands. There would be no mound visits, and plate umpires would stand way behind the catchers. Old-buzzard managers and antique clubhouse guys, we’ll assume, would wear masks, latex gloves and maybe full-body plastic suits.

Crazy.

The thing is, it would be baseball. With real major-leaguers playing.

How could anyone be against that?

Baseball is such a powerful symbol in America — of springtime, rebirth, stability and a deep psychological connection to our past — that the major leagues played right on through World Wars I and II. Not to play would have been to further traumatize the souls of the men and women fighting overseas.

Indeed, on Jan. 15, 1942, five weeks after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote to commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis about that exact thing.

‘‘I honestly feel that it would be best for the country to keep baseball going,’’ Roosevelt wrote.

President Donald Trump has weighed in on pro sports, too, saying, for instance, that he fully expects the NFL season to start on time in September. But expectations aren’t facts. And Trump previously said he anticipated all of us being jammed joyously into churches on Easter, four days from now. As if.

It’s possible May is way too soon to bring people together in numbers large enough and close enough to each other to play baseball. The virus still is raging in April, remember. Indeed, as I write this, Illinois has just recorded its largest one-day death toll — 73 — since the virus struck.

Will the players be immune in a month or so? Will they be so closely guarded that nobody in the entire Arizona baseball family will bring the virus into the ballpark?

After all, there’s no way some double plays won’t get a player closer to a middle infielder than safe social distancing. How about pitchers going to their mouth? All that spitting, sliding, sweating?

And to play in June? And then in July, August and September in the desert? Whoa, baby. Ever been to Phoenix in the summer? I have. I remember my shoes sticking to the melting asphalt in a parking lot as though glued there.

So day games are out, and you’d have to cram schedules for 30 teams into night games at the 10 practice stadiums and Chase Field.

MLB and the players’ union already are saying they could play seven-inning doubleheaders at night. Extra innings? Call it a tie and move on.

You see, there’s an answer for every problem if both sides are adaptable.

Everybody sequestered like monks in off-limits hotels scattered around the valley? Sure. Why not?

It could be done. Broadcasts on TV. Players miked for the fans’ enjoyment. Crowd noise piped in. Scratching and gum-chewing still allowed.

Fights? Maybe you’d have to don gloves and surgical masks before throwing down.

But don’t forget that MLB is a $10 billion enterprise. You don’t jam in the plug on that kind of spigot unless you absolutely have to.

Maybe none of this will happen. Instant coronavirus tests, available to all, could change much. A COVID-19 vaccine would solve all.

But bring it on, I say.

A message appearing Thursday on the Physicians Immediate Care website said, “Due to the limited availability of test kits, we are currently unable to test for COVID-19 in Illinois.”

“We hope to have more tests soon, and we will update our website when available,” the message said. “Testing is still available in Indiana.”

Todd Vang, the company’s chief operating officer, told the Sun-Times that testing would resume on Friday at 34 sites statewide, including in Chicago in Bucktown, Edgewater, Jefferson Park, near Peterson Park, Lincoln Park, North Center, Old Town, Six Corners and the West Loop.

“When our supply chain is disrupted due to supply or delivery issues and we do not have tests, we halt our testing and also post that on our website,” said Vang, who wouldn’t say how many times testing has been interrupted due to similar supply chain issues.

Testing is key to easing stay-at-home orders, and curbside testing in cars makes the process easier for people with symptoms. During Thursday’s state press briefing, Dr. Ngozi Ezike, the director of Illinois Department of Public Health, said officials “want to get as many people tested as possible.”

President Donald Trump often boasts about the nation’s testing capacity, though critics hold that the country’s testing levels are still inadequate for getting a full sense of the true rate of infection.

“We have a great testing capacity now. It’s getting even better,” he said at Monday’s briefing. “There’s nobody close to us in the world. And we certainly have done a great job on testing.”

When testing comes back online at the Physicians Immediate Care clinics, Vang said his they would continue to use the Abbott ID NOW test, which has come under scrutiny after a recent study showed it produced a high rate of false negative results.

“We use the ID Now as a point of care test (meaning we swab the patient and directly insert into the machine). That is the recommended method by Abbott of using the instruments,” Vang said in a text message. He added that the clinics also use lab tests in some cases.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Though Treider said she wasn’t concerned about stepping into a hospital in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, it still felt at times like she was riding an “emotional roller coaster.”

“It’s just the normal fears that can pop into your mind of the things that could go wrong,” she said. “And you quickly try to push them away, but they come back.”

Treider is just one of the patients traveling to Illinois to see Dr. Richard Berger of Rush Hospital, one of the first orthopedic surgeons in the Chicago area. While Pennsylvania restarted elective surgeries April 27, Treider said she was willing to wait for Illinois to lift its restrictions because Berger was highly recommended by a friend and she had already been in line for surgery with him.

After postponing surgeries for roughly two months when the coronavirus took hold, Berger said his schedule is now jam-packed with patients eager to go under the knife.

“They planned everything around having surgery done and finally alleviating their pain, finally restoring their function. And then for obviously good reasons, we canceled their surgery or postponed their surgery. And it’s just been heartbreaking for them,” said Berger, who estimated that roughly half of his patients come from outside Illinois.

When elective surgeries resumed Monday in Illinois, hospitals had new safeguards in place to protect patients and medical staff from the deadly virus.

At Rush Oak Brook, where Treider is undergoing surgery, those new measures include strict social distancing guidelines, screening and temperature checks and new requirements for more staff members to wear both masks and gloves. In addition, family members can no longer wait inside the hospital and patients must be tested for COVID-19 ahead of their surgery.

But Berger noted that health care workers have long been taken precautions to prevent the spread of disease. For example, he said his team wears “hermetically-sealed space suits” and performs operations in rooms that are pumped with sterile air that helps filter out “any pathogens, any bacteria [and] any virus.

“We assume every patient has something that we don’t want to get,” he said. “And we assume that no patient wants to get anything that we get.”

As surgeons like Berger have gotten back to work, the Illinois Department of Public Health has made it clear that elective surgeries could again be suspended in the case of a “rapid resurgence or a second wave of COVID-19” or a “decrease in statewide hospital COVID-19 testing levels.”

In retrospect, Berger said, it was unnecessary to shut down elective procedures, which are a vital source of revenue for hospitals. Because everyone is screened at his hospital, Berger claimed that having a joint replacement surgery is currently safer than going to a grocery store or a gas station.

“We were thinking this was going to be Armageddon,” he said. “We thought the hospital would be 100% filled and overspilled. McCormick Place made a makeshift hospital that was going to be filled. Well, it turned out there was no patients that ever went there. Our hospital wasn’t filled. No other hospital was filled.

“Now thank God, of course, but we were wrong.”

Meanwhile, as Treider prepared for her operation on Wednesday morning, her concerns about the procedure have been allayed by her confidence in Berger. An avid tennis player, Treider can’t wait to get the surgery done so she can get back on the court this summer.

In all, 3,910 new cases were reported this week along with 472 new deaths, according to a count by the Chicago Sun-Times. That brings state nursing home cases to 11,437 and deaths to 1,553. Last week, the state saw one-week increases of 3,229 cases and 456 deaths.

Long-term care facilities now account for 48% of Illinois’ 3,241 COVID-19 deaths, records show.

As was the case last week, the numbers, reported weekly, have inconsistencies from week to week and, because of lags in reporting, appear to be lower than the real-time toll the virus is taking on those facilities. Some homes, for example, reported fewer cases or deaths this week than last, an issue officials have attributed in part to further investigation revealing non-COVID health issues.

This week, 18 more homes reached double-digit deaths, bringing that total to 51 facilities across the state. Twenty-two have reported more than 100 total cases, with two homes over 200.

The largest increase in deaths this week came at Meadowbrook Manor of Bolingbrook, where 16 people died, bringing that home’s total deaths to 26 — the most in the state. ManorCare Hinsdale reported 13 new deaths this week and is up to 19 since the start of the pandemic.

The highest case count at any nursing home in the state is at Ludeman Developmental Center in Park Forest, with 265 confirmed positives and six deaths. City View Multicare Center in Cicero has 262 cases — an increase of 228 since last week, the largest in the state — and nine deaths.

The workers, members of SEIU Healthcare Illinois, announced a tentative agreement Thursday on a two-year contract that includes a $15 minimum wage for all workers, hazard pay during the pandemic, additional sick days and provisions ensuring that employees are not required to work without adequate equipment to protect themselves from the virus.

During a virtual news conference Thursday, Greg Kelley, president of SEIU Healthcare Illinois Indiana Missouri & Kansas, noted that nursing homes have become “hotspots” where COVID-19 has spread rapidly and said the agreement will help “safeguard the safety” of both the workers and residents.

Francine Rico, a certified nursing assistant at Villa at Windsor Park in South Shore, told reporters that supplies are still limited at her facility, where 91 staff members and residents have tested positive for the coronavirus. Fifteen of them have died, according to data compiled by the Illinois Department of Public Health.

“Our members are still needing to use gowns and raincoats and use your mask for a week,” said Rico.

Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill, bemoaned essential workers like Rico having to re-use protective gear, faulting the “complete failure” by the federal government to control the supply.

“When we call people essential workers — we say they have to go to work — then it is really the responsibility in this pandemic that we get them the materials and the protection that they need,” said Schakowsky, who has introduced legislation to bolster protections for nursing home residents and workers amid the pandemic. “It is one of the most infuriating, unacceptable things that I have ever heard of.”

Schakowsky noted that 44% of COVID-19 deaths in Illinois are attributable to long-term care facilities and lauded the workers for taking a stand to further protect themselves and their patients.

The Illinois Association of Health Care Facilities, which represented the nursing homes in negotiations, said: “While negotiations have ended, this insidious virus has not. We are grateful a walkout was avoided, and that our heroic staff members will continue caring for our vulnerable seniors as we fight this battle together.”

The agreement covers more than 10,000 members of SEIU Healthcare who provide care to residents at more than 100 nursing homes. SEIU Healthcare is an investor in Sun-Times Media.

Testing. What’s that all about? I understand they scrape inside your nose with a giant swab, then send the tip off to a lab to determine whether you’ve been infected by COVID-19.

But toward what end?

If you’re really sick, doctors need to know if it’s coronavirus to guide treatment. No confusion there. But what’s the goal of testing the general population? To track the pandemic’s spread? Important, but that isn’t why people are jamming National Guard drive-thru locations. Fear? Mere curiosity?

Opinion

The general idea, as best I understand it, is that you may have been infected but had no symptoms — many do not — and once you learn you were already infected but are OK now, then you can breathe a big sigh of relief and go about your business, packing into bars, jamming into church pews, secure in the knowledge you can’t get sick because you already have been.

You’d think that, desperate to get the economy back, both the dithering federal government and people protesting the lockdown would unite in one voice to demand those tests, now.

But they’re not. The federal government hems and haws like Hamlet, then shrugs and tells the states to figure it out — all while Fox News types cram statehouse steps to decry any organized attempt to save their lives as fascism.

Even municipalities are trying to get people tested, as are businesses like Simple Laboratories of Harwood Heights, a relatively new (founded 2014), relatively small (200 employees) diagnostic lab reaching over the paralyzed health care system, directly to the public, sorting out the general confusion as it goes.

“We’re in a world of questions right now,” said Narni Yoder, co-founder and chief sales officer of Simple Laboratories, which began drive-thru testing last week. “It’s not black and white.”

No kidding. Not long ago, Simple Labs was busy doing basic “tried and true” tests — scanning blood samples for venereal disease and hepatitis, diabetes and cancer. And then this plague came, and it began testing for that.

Diagnostic labs setting up white tents in church parking lots is a hint the medical system isn’t working.

“We couldn’t wait any longer,” said Yoder. “We tried to go through the normal channels of our clinics, doctors we work with independently. The majority are closed to patients. Everybody is funneled to emergency rooms. But those turn patients away and tell them to go to doctors. Our normal ways weren’t going to work; we had to find our own options. Three weeks ago, we realized: We can just do it. We need to figure it out.”

A lot of people need to do that. Yoder said her facility could process up to 4,000 tests a day but is doing only about 100.

“Our limitation is collection,” said Yoder, adding they’d like to work with groups, such as nursing homes.

No doubt. And I want to sell more papers. But why are tests important?

“People should know their status,” Yoder said. “People should be able to take care of themselves. If you don’t know, it causes more worry. When you know, you might have a path.”

That seemed awfully general. Most people, I imagine, have not been exposed to COVID-19, so testing does nothing besides put $100 into the pockets of places like Simple Laboratories while the tested person ends up in the exact same position: at home, wiping down cans of soup from Sunset Foods.

Right?

“A couple of ways to think about it,” she said. “One, without testing, we can’t move forward. How do we move everybody forward? We’ve been focusing on first responders. What about the rest of the community? What about everyone else? How do we move everything forward? ... That testing is critical.”

“It’s an important step forward,” said Arlene Jezierny, the mayor of Harwood Heights.

I’m all for moving forward. Yoder wouldn’t reveal what percentage of people they’ve tested had been exposed — trade secret — but I persisted. Most haven’t, right? Right?

“The majority of people were not exposed,” she allowed.

It’s all about moving forward.

“The faster we can test more folks, the more information we can contribute to the community and we’ll be able to bring everybody back to some sense of normalcy,” Yoder said.

J.B. Pritzker announced Thursday that 177 public sites are now offering free coronavirus testing across the state, with 65 new locations added since Pritzker reported last week that Illinois had reached the elusive goal of processing 10,000 tests in a single day.

Since hitting that mark last Friday, Illinois has run 96,551 total tests and hasn’t once dipped below that daily benchmark. The tests conducted over the past seven days account for more than 35% of the tests the state has conducted since reporting began in early March.

With his modified stay-at-home taking effect on Friday, Pritzker made it clear that testing for the deadly virus is “vital to our efforts to reduce social restrictions, get our economy going and to protect our residents.”

A drive-thru site at Norwegian American Hospital in Humboldt Park is among the new testing locations that have recently opened in minority communities that have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Jose Sanchez, the hospital’s president and CEO, announced Thursday that over 80% of those tested since the site opened Tuesday have been Latino or African American.

Speaking to reporters at the governor’s daily press briefing, Sanchez said the new testing site helps “address the serious health inequities we have seen in our community.” The Sun-Times reported Thursday that the Latino community in Illinois has surpassed African Americans in confirmed cases of the coronavirus and could have the greatest number of patients among all races and ethnic groups within days.

“It is critical that we identify the individuals that have COVID-19 early so we can provide interventions and prevent the spread of virus in our underserved communities,” added Sanchez, who said the hospital is expected to run “hundreds” of COVID-19 tests by the end of the week.

In addition to the substantial increase in community testing sites like Norwegian, Pritzker announced that new drive-thru sites operated by the state will open next week in Waukegan and East St. Louis. Once those get up-and-running, Pritzker set a goal of collecting a total of 3,000 daily swabs at those seven sites.

As more tests have been processed, a lower rate have started to come back positive. Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike attributed that decrease to the state’s expanded criteria for testing, which had initially been limited to those considered at high risk of contracting the disease.

Casting a wider net is vital for getting a better sense of the true rate of infection. In South Korea, a country of 51 million that acted swiftly to institute an aggressive testing system, the positivity rate has hovered around 3%. Meanwhile, the rate of positive tests in Illinois has fallen to around 20%.

“We will have that lower positivity rate, but be grateful for the ones that we identify,” Ezike said.

While Pritzker said the state has taken considerable steps to address the shortage of supplies needed to run tests — including striking a deal with the White House to obtain hundreds of thousands of swabs and vials of the solution needed to transport them — he made it clear that the country “just doesn’t produce enough of these raw materials to meet the medical need.”

“Our procurement teams have been hard at work competing for those raw materials against every nation and every state in the open market,” Pritzker said. “And so far, we’re succeeding.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

As of Thursday, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported 12,276 cases where the patient is white, 11,848 among Latinos, and 11,353 in the black community.

Last week, on April 22, there were about 7,800 patients who were white, 5,800 who identified as Latino and 8,100 who were African American.

The dramatic rise in cases among Latinos is reflective of better testing capabilities and greater awareness of COVID-19 symptoms, but public health experts are raising concerns about the state’s reach among Latino communities in their efforts to contain the pandemic.

“The trend that we’re seeing is that cases among the Latino community are doubling at a faster rate than everyone else, but the response has been limited in those emerging hotspots,” said Aida Giachello, a medical sociologist at Northwestern University and member of the Illinois Latino Covid-19 Initiative, a community outreach group.

“We want sufficient attention and resources to tackle the virus in our community. We need better messaging on what to do if you contract the virus and how to protect others, especially in Spanish.”

Of the coronavirus cases where a patient’s race and ethnicity was reported, 31% are white, 29% are black and 30% are Latino, according to the state health department. About a quarter of the state’s nearly 53,000 cases do not list the patient’s race or ethnicity.

By way of comparison, whites account for 60% of the state’s population, Latinos make up 17%, and African Americans account for 14%.

About 2,400 Illinoisans have died from COVID-19, 40% of whom were white, 35% were black and 14% were Latino.

Arise Chicago labor organizer Jorge Mujica said another reason behind the rising cases among Latinos is they are at high risk of contracting the virus at their workplaces.

“It’s obvious that the source of the spread of the virus has shifted from people traveling to people working, and we know Latinos and African Americans are more likely to work outside their homes,” he said.

Mujica said Latino workers across the state have complained to him about employers not providing proper equipment and work conditions that don’t allow for social distancing.

“Labor laws are violated everyday, this is nothing new, and so we’re seeing the same thing when it comes to the new coronavirus rules and guidelines,” he said.

State figures show many ZIP codes reporting the highest number of coronavirus cases encompass predominantly Latino working-class areas like Little Village and Belmont Cragin in Chicago and suburbs like Cicero.

Share All sharing options for: ‘Our worst day’: The fight to treat patients and keep a hospital staffed on the Far South Side

Capri Reese can’t go home. Not unless she finds someone to step into her shoes.

“All of a sudden we’re down five staff in one day,” said the 12-year veteran nurse at Roseland Community Hospital, who Tuesday had to track down coworkers on their day off and get them to the hospital, in addition to all her usual duties.

“I see patients, treat patients, respond to codes, rapid response, intubate, order tests, write prescriptions,” Reese said. “All of those things, and I’m also covering for the CNO — the chief nursing officer.”

Five holes in a 14-person staff, including someone to do her job after her 12-hour shift. Those are very big charm-studded Crocs to fill.

“It’s a juggling thing, like a rolling puzzle, every day,” she said. “People who don’t usually call off are calling off.”

Why? Exhaustion, stress, ailments like the ordinary flu, plus absences related to COVID-19 — battling it themselves, caring for a relation who is, or watching their children because daycare centers are closed.

Against those obstacles, Reese has only her considerable charm.

“Strap that S on your chest and come in,” Reese said over the phone to a triage tech.

He agreed.

“I won the lottery!” exuded Reese. ”He’s totally coming in on his day off. Everybody is really stepping up.”

She worked the schedule in Roseland’s “brain box,” the cluttered office where staffing is managed. But a code blue alarm — there will be five during her shift — had her jumping to her feet. She ran — not walked fast, not trotted, but full-out sprinted — down the hall, phone still pressed to her ear, talking to one of the staffing agencies the hospital has turned to, trying to keep warm bodies in scrubs to treat the bodies in beds.

The problem with staffing agencies, she said, is that other war zones, like New York, are paying top dollar, and her nurses are taking it.

“Their husband may be out of work, and they tell me, ‘It’s not so much I don’t love Roseland, but they’re offering me more money and we’re down an income,’” Reese said.

‘Like playing dodgeball’

Once in the emergency department, she jams the phone in a pocket; staffing concerns are forgotten in the rainstorm of immediate problems, big and small.

A patient has wandered away from his room and doesn’t know where he belongs.

“Capri, handle this,” said a doctor, shrugging away the situation.

The ER is low on protective gowns; Reese rushes to the stock room.

“It’s like playing dodgeball,” she said. Like dodgeball, there is much starting and stopping. It seems she will greet everyone in her line of sight by name and can’t take five steps without someone asking her something.

“People are comfortable asking me,” said Reese, who keeps asking passersby, “Can you work until 11? Can you work until 11?”

“I need you,” she said, again and again. “I need you.”

Others, she’ll merely buck up, asking how they are. Not wanting to hug — a more important part of hospital work than outsiders might realize — they’ve developed an elaborate code of bows, foot taps, even the occasional curtsy.

“The nursing staff is under enormous stress,” Reese said.

‘It’s hitting home’

This all happened so fast. Six weeks. The first person with COVID-19 came into Roseland, on West 111th Street on the Far South Side, on March 15.

“Every day since then,” Reese said. “It isn’t some virus overseas. It’s home; it’s hitting home. It became so real. Pandemonium. People coming in, while information and standards change day to day. While we’re trying to get creative, expand to deal with the volume of patients. It’s overwhelming.”

Unless it’s not. The COVID unit can be silent. Scary quiet. Reese misses the presence of visitors, banished because of the fear of infection. Visitors are a vital line of defense in the health care chain.

“Normally patients have a visitor, sitting with their mom, letting you know their needs. Those are the assessments we are really missing out on. All the history, what’s going on with their mother, their father. Real time information. Everybody being isolated, it’s really hard to manage all of it, being one nurse.”

The deathly silence in the COVID-19 ward is broken by alarms, screams, cries for help. Reese joined knots of staffers, crammed into Roseland’s tiny rooms, responding to five code blues — hospital jargon for when a patient’s heart stops beating — and two rapid responses. Three patients died during her Tuesday shift, all of COVID-19.

“It was our worst day,” said Reese.

The stress of losing patients, of keeping gravely ill patients alive, of being family to the dying, bursts out sometimes. A patient gasped for air, but kept tearing off her BiPAP mask.

“Help me! Help me!” she cried.

“Patients have so much anxiety, even a little shortness of breath causes them to go into a panic,” said Reese.

One nurse wanted to restrain the struggling patient so she’d keep wearing the BiPAP, a pressurized breathing device. Another nurse argued that restraining the patient is wrong.

“No, we’re not doing that!” she said, adding that the patient was not a criminal.

The argument quickly grew heated, with swearing and shouting.

“Talk to me when you go to college for another four years!” snapped the senior nurse. “Until then, you don’t tell me what to do!”

One nurse stormed out and took a walk to calm down. The senior nurse stayed; the patient eventually was coaxed back into the mask.

Reese herself is not immune to the pressure. Last week, with no visitors allowed, a nurse held a cell phone so a dying woman’s daughter could say goodbye to her mother, apologizing for not being the child she should have been. Then the nurse handed the phone to Reese, to flee the room, weeping. When she returned, Reese handed the phone back to her and left the room; she had to cry, too.

“We never had the chance to talk about it,” said Reese, of the second nurse. “We had another rapid response.”

At home, a game face

Reese, who grew up in the Roseland community, misses having a life outside the hospital. Her family certainly misses her.

“It’s been a while, because of the coronavirus,” said her mother, Chrystle Lee, a breast cancer survivor. “I’m like, ‘Oh, come on over. You’ve got the mask on.’ And she says, ‘You don’t understand, you’re high risk. Your immune system is down. I can’t come over there.’”

There was a trace of criticism as she imitated her daughter’s refusal. Then Lee softens.

“She’ll order me food, from Uber Eats. I don’t even have to ask. It’s just there. We have a good family.”

The difficulties of getting the message to her mother is something Capri Reese sees throughout the community.

“When this disease first broke out, everybody thought that for some reason that this was not a disease for African Americans,” she said. “That it didn’t affect us. It’s actually the opposite. We’re getting that message out there, where my family lives. If people are infected and are shopping, we’re all exposed.”

At 7 p.m. Reese indeed was able to go home after 12 hours on duty. “I got two people to come in, three to stay later,” she said. “I’m still short.”

Her own family — a 15-year-old daughter, unhappy about not going to school, and Reese’s 18-year-old younger brother — live in a South Loop apartment.

At home, Reese immediately stripped off her lab coat and cleaned her shoes with antibacterial spray. Still wearing a mask, she took off her aqua scrubs and put them directly into the washing machine; the machine, and a shower, are conveniently near the door.

She stepped into the shower — some alone time, to assemble her game face.

The initial diagnosis is just the start of the staff’s work, though. What comes next is the arduous task of tracking down every person that patient may have encountered, a time-tested public health practice known commonly as contact tracing.

Though local and state officials have said that process is key to slowing the pandemic and reopening the state, a large-scale initiative hasn’t been announced to address the daunting task of tracking down every person who has come into contact with the growing number of COVID-19 patients. On Wednesday, 2,253 new cases were reported across Illinois as the total number of cases eclipsed 50,000.

One day per patient

Dr. John Schneider, a University of Chicago faculty member who serves as the Howard Brown clinic’s medical director, explained that a single staff member requires around a full day to call an infected person’s entire chain of direct and indirect contacts. That web of connections typically consists of roughly 10 people, most of whom haven’t even been around the original patient.

While roughly two-thirds of those contacts wind up testing positive, Schneider said close contacts living with an infected person are even more likely to come down with the disease. Facing a deadly virus that can spread insidiously to carriers who don’t show symptoms, contact tracers must move swiftly to interrupt the chain of infection.

“There’s definitely cases where we’ve observed that if we had intervened a couple days earlier, we could’ve prevented transmission events,” said Schneider, whose team consists of 15 contact tracers and three “data people.”

Schneider believes the state has been slow to launch a larger effort and holds that getting a contact tracing system in place is vital for responding to the current outbreak and a possible resurgence in a few months.

“I really think it’s about doing the best we can now, knowing it’s not going to be perfect,” he said.

State system a work in progress, gov says

Officials haven’t said how many people will be needed to ramp up contact tracing statewide.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker told reporters on Tuesday that state officials were still trying to “spin up” a system, which he said is “a very large endeavor” that requires both hiring and technology. And Illinois Department of Public Health Director Ngozi Ezike alluded to a large-scale deployment of contact tracers in an interview last week with the New Yorker, saying thousands would likely be needed across the state.

In addition to traditional community outreach, Chicago Public Health Commissioner Allison Arwady said Tuesday that an app rolled out by the city earlier this week to offer coronavirus-related assistance and allow Chicagoans to pre-register for a vaccine could ultimately be used for contact tracing.

“That kind of technology would be a total game-changer here,” Lightfoot said about similar technology being developed in Germany.

“We’ve learned that when people get multiple folks calling them, they’re more likely to engage or to be contacted”

Limited tracing taking place already

For now, public health workers in Chicago and Cook County are already conducting limited contact tracing of COVID-19 patients.

The county was employing 29 contact tracers as of April 16, including four dedicated to congregate settings like nursing homes and the Cook County Jail. Meanwhile, the city’s current contact tracing efforts are also focused on those types of facilities.

As a result, investigators from both departments sometimes collect the same information, which is then routed to a statewide system state officials use to track cases. According to Schneider, it can actually be useful to have multiple tracers reaching out to a single person.

“We’ve learned that when people get multiple folks calling them, they’re more likely to engage or to be contacted,” he said. “You don’t wanna be completely inefficient but some overlap is okay.”

Private firm recruiting in Chicago

In recent days, a Washington, D.C.-based recruitment firm that launched just a week ago has started hiring contact tracers in Chicago and other major cities. Contrace Public Health Corps ultimately hopes to recruit 20,000 workers nationwide by May 15, the company’s founder and CEO Steve Waters said in an interview.

“Contact tracing is the largest US civilian mobilization since World War II,” the company says in its job postings, which advertise pay of $17-22 an hour.

Waters said the newly-minted company has not been contracted by any government agencies in Illinois. Instead, applicants from Chicago will likely be hired by a local employment agency or nonprofit, who he said will prioritize the hiring of residents with “an understanding of local geography and culture.”

“Our model is based on the premise that as we are not operating as a traditional recruiting company,” said Waters. “We can help local and state agencies and nonprofits stand up contact tracing efforts, at scale, much more quickly and at a much, much lower cost than traditional recruiters.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The patient was a Chicago man in his 40s who arrived at Weiss Memorial Hospital in “moderate to severe” condition and had not responded to other treatments, said Dr. Suzanne Pham, the hospital’s associate medical director. The patient, who had few other health issues, was close to having to be ventilated, Pham said.

“Within 24 hours of plasma infusion, [he] was able to be weaned down on his oxygen needs and was able to be discharged from the hospital within three days of that plasma infusion,” Pham said Wednesday. “So he recovered very quickly and nicely.”

The patient was discharged in mid-April, she said.

Pham said the recovery was a point of pride for a small community hospital, which has about 120 beds. On Wednesday, the hospital had about 70 coronavirus-positive patients and another 20 awaiting test results, Pham said.

The hospital was able to offer the treatment through a program led by the Minnesota-based Mayo Clinic, with the donor blood coming from the American Red Cross, Pham said. The treatment involves coronavirus patients being injected with a one-time dose of 200 milliliters of plasma.

“That plasma does have evidence of antibodies that potentially can attack the virus and hence, once transfused into a patient suffering from acute stages of illness, can help that patient recover more rapidly,” Pham said.

Three other Weiss coronavirus patients have been given the treatment, but Pham said it’s too early to say if the therapy will result in “significant benefits.”

“While convalescent plasma use remains investigational, we are cautiously optimistic that it will continue to show promise as a treatment option for our COVID-19 patients,” Pham said.

Several major local hospitals — including Rush University Medical Center and UChicago Medicine — are enrolled in trials involving the use of plasma treatment for the coronavirus. Spokespeople for each institution said Wednesday it’s too early to talk about possible success rates.

A spokeswoman for Northwestern Memorial Hospital said the hospital is also involved in a national study, but is still awaiting the availability of plasma before beginning treatment.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

From mandatory temperature checks to contact tracing, Lightfoot said Chicagoans who have lost jobs during the coronavirus pandemic could find new ones when the twice-extended stay-at-home order is finally lifted.

“There are going to be a whole new class of jobs that didn’t exist before that are gonna be coming out of our thoughts about what recovery and opening up the city looks like,” the mayor said.

“There’s gonna be a whole category of new people that are gonna be working for businesses and buildings. Their job ... is gonna be making sure that people that enter those premises are well. … We’re gonna be able to ultimately employ more people because it’s going to be necessary for us to feel secure coming into congregate settings again.”

Will the new normal require everyone entering City Hall and other government buildings to have their temperature checked?

“We’re looking at a range of options — not just at City Hall, but in businesses across the city … to give people a confidence that they can return to congregate settings and make sure that we’ve got the resources — physically on site — to address any issues,” she said.

“Temperature checks ... [are] certainly one of the things we’re looking at. But we haven’t quite landed yet on what the bundle of options are that we’re gonna adopt at city buildings, including City Hall, and what we’re going to insist [on] as a bare minimum for businesses across the city.”

The mayor vowed to established those “minimum thresholds” in time for what she called a “slow, gradual re-opening, step-by-step” of a Chicago economy that has ground to a virtual halt and will remain so through May.

Earlier this week, City Hall unveiled a new web-based app Chicagoans can use to pre-register for a coronavirus vaccine, get text messages tailored to their symptoms and receive guidance about seeking medical care.

Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady acknowledged the app could ultimately be used as a technology springboard to do contact tracing and said asking registrants how many people live in their households was a “first step.”

On Tuesday, Lightfoot talked again about the conversation she had this week with the mayor of Hamburg, Germany.

The German government is working on a mobile phone app that will “collect information about who you’ve been in contact with, then automatically send out an alert” whenever that person tests positive for the coronavirus, the mayor said.

“That kind of technology would be total game-changer here,” Lightfoot said.

“But in the interim between where we are now and where we get to more technology,” contact tracing will likely require an army of people making calls and banging on doors.

Arwady said contact tracing is already part of the “case investigation” that occurs whenever someone in a long-term care facility or a homeless shelter tests positive for the coronavirus.

But the broader version of contract tracing likely required to re-open the Chicago economy could involve a “community health worker model,” she said.

Health Department epidemiologists could be paired with “folks from communities” that have borne the brunt of the coronavirus in “parts of the city where more people have the kinds of jobs that might take longer to come back,” the commissioner said.

“That’s all dependent on really seeing how some of those resources come down, particularly from the federal level,” Arwady said.

Also during Tuesday’s conference call with City Hall reporters, Lightfoot said she’s “hard at work” on plans for Chicago Park District camps and other summer youth programs and hopes to have guidance for anxious parents shortly.

But, under repeated questioning, she refused to pinpoint the size of the city’s budget shortfall caused by the pandemic.

“We’re not ready because we don’t know the full magnitude of the impact. We never want to put any numbers out and then have to dramatically change them because the world changes,” she said",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The financial support will enable U. of C. and its partners to expand testing to 1,000 people a day, according to a statement Tuesday. Uninsured patients will be tested for free, while those with health insurance will simply have their provider billed and won’t be subjected to co-pays.

The grant funding comes from the nonprofit United Health Foundation, which was established by the UnitedHealth Group, a publicly traded health care firm based in Minneapolis. The donation is part of the company’s initial $70 million commitment to fight COVID-19 and support areas that have been disproportionately affected by the virus.

“We are grateful to the United Health Foundation for its support of our efforts to provide much needed care to communities disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 emergency,” said Brenda Battle, vice president of UChicago Medicine’s Urban Health Initiative and chief diversity and inclusion officer.

“The financial support will allow South Side health care providers to ramp up staff and supplies needed to make testing more widely available to those most at risk in the community, which is critical to our efforts to prevent further spread of COVID-19.”

Five zip codes included in U. of C.’s coverage area have some of the highest rates of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Chicago, with African Americans bearing the brunt of the infections. As of Monday, blacks accounted for 60% of the 2,576 confirmed cases in those zip codes.

Earlier this month, U. of C. officials announced a partnership to ramp up screening for the deadly virus. In addition to testing at the University of Chicago Medical Center and Ingalls Memorial Hospital in Harvey, U. of C. is also partnering with community hospitals, nursing facilities and federally qualified health centers.

U. of C.’s “testing partners” include La Rabida Children’s Hospital, St. Anthony Hospital, St. Bernard Hospital, Palos Heights Hospital, Family Christian Health Center, Montgomery Place, Symphony South Shore and Villa at Windsor Park. Some are conducting coronavirus testing, while others are simply referring patients to U. of C. for testing.

The grant money will support that initiative and also be used to train staff members to test and treat patients, conduct contact tracing, pay for personal protective equipment and other supplies and provide temporary housing for those who test positive.

New testing site in Humboldt Park

The announcement comes five days after the state reached the elusive goal of conducting 10,000 daily tests. Since Friday, the state’s daily testing numbers haven’t dipped below 11,985.

As the state’s testing capacity has increased, attention has shifted to running more tests in underserved communities in Chicago. Starting Tuesday, all adult residents of Humboldt Park symptoms and an appointment can now get tested in the parking lot of Norwegian American Hospital, 1044 N. Francisco Ave.

Ald. Gilbert Villegas (36th) said he convened a Monday meeting between the building owner and the commander of the CPD’s Grand Central District, who issued the woman “a couple citations for public nuisance and gave her strict warnings and we also have just put her on notice.”

Video footage of the weekend party in the 2000 block of North Narragansett quickly went viral. Clips posted to Facebook showed dozens of people crammed into the home, with everyone standing in very close proximity and hardly anyone wearing protective masks.

Villegas — Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s floor leader in City Council — said the party was the doing of the building owner’s adult son. The owner’s son had a set of keys to the building and was able to disarm the home’s alarm system. It was the second party he’s thrown in the building in recent weeks, Villegas said.

The home, in Chicago’s Galewood community, is in Villegas’ ward.

Earlier in the day, Lightfoot vowed to “get to the bottom” of the party — and hold everyone involved accountable for the public health risk.

Lightfoot said the city is “still in the midst of the investigation to identify the specific location” of the party, captured on a shocking Facebook video that already had been viewed more than a million times before it was taken down Monday.

The party is believed to have taken place somewhere on the West Side, but City Hall is still “nailing down specifics,” she said.

The mayor argued “everybody involved” in the party “bears a level of responsibility” and will ultimately be held accountable.

“When you see a scene like that where you have, literally, it looked to me, like hundreds of people gathered in a small, confined space literally cheek-to-jowl like that, it goes against all of the things we’ve been talking about. All of the things that the vast majority of Chicagoans understand and know,” the mayor said.

“They put themselves at risk. But not only that. Every single person there who put themselves at risk puts the next person and the next person that they come into contact with at risk. That’s why, for me, that scene is so distressing. But, we’ll get to the bottom of it.”

Lightfoot pointed to “Zoom chats” and other opportunities for young people to connect using social media. She said the city plans to “step up and do a lot over the course of the summer, depending on where we are in the arc of this virus” and how much the stay-at-home order is relaxed. But she argued a shortage of organized teen activities is no excuse to flout the statewide, stay-at-home order.

“What happened in that scene was just foolish and reckless. There’s got to be a level of personal responsibility for that. Millenials aren’t children. Millenials—many of `em—are in their 20’s. They’re fully functioning adults. And we expect adults to act responsibly—particularly at a time of pandemic,” the mayor said.

Videographer Tink Purcell captured the chaotic Saturday night party scene from halfway up a staircase and streamed it live on Facebook for about 24 minutes.

Some partygoers were wearing face masks, but most were not. Social distancing was out the window as those in attendance danced and drank elbow-to-elbow while lines formed at the front door and on the stairs.

The mayor was asked how she plans to prevent similarly unauthorized house parties as temperatures rise and cabin fever builds.

“I can’t prevent people from being foolish. I wish I had that kind of power. What we can do ... is educate people about why taking those kinds of risks are unnecessary and foolish, talk about personal responsibility and then, where we see it, take decisive action and make sure that we shut it down,” Lightfoot said.

“I have no compunction about setting the appropriate example in egregious situations like we saw. Not just in that event, but there were several other large-scale parties that the police department was called upon to break up over the weekend. We’re not gonna set the standard for the summer and warmer weather by allowing people to flout all the public health guidance we’ve been giving.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The “Chi COVID Coach” app was developed by Google and MTX to help the Chicago Department of Public Health communicate with Chicagoans who have either tested positive for the virus or may be experiencing symptoms.

Those who register will get “daily check-ins” on their well-being, as well as advice about “what they and other people in their households should do to limit the spread of the coronavirus.”

Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said registration “doesn’t put you first in line for the vaccine” but will help the city “hit the ground running” once vaccine finally does become available.

Although Lightfoot and Arwady said a coronavirus vaccine is not expected until 2021, both added they are already mapping plans to vaccinate the entire city by purchasing syringes and other equipment and choosing locations to administer shots.

And officials are thinking about technology they’ll need to use to link peoples’ symptoms to test results, vaccination and, ultimately, contact tracing.

Contract tracing involves tracing everyone that a person who tested positive for the coronavirus has been in contact with; the practice is viewed as a crucial step to safely re-open the Chicago economy.

As for privacy concerns, Arwady said her team has “done a lot to make sure that all of the appropriate protections are in place.” Information provided by Chicagoans who register will only be “accessible to the Chicago Department of Public Health,” she said.

“No plans for Google, for example, to be able to collect that information. No plans to share it, except for the work that CDPH is doing in partnership with clinicians to make sure that people are getting the care, the testing and the vaccination for COVID-19 that is required,” Arwady said.

The commissioner acknowledged using the app as a springboard to do contact tracing is “one of the spaces that we’re exploring.” When people register, they’ll be asked how many people live in their household. Arwady called the question a “first step” toward contact tracing.

“We’re talking with the developers about the possibility, for example, to be able to send an alert to my contacts — to have that be part of the conversation. None of that is built into it right now,” Arwady said.

“As we’re making our plans for contact tracing, a lot of that is sort of boots-on-the-ground — or at least people on the telephone calling, doing long conversations with individuals, understanding who’s at risk and then, following up with them. We definitely think that technology plays some role in this and that the app may very well be a piece of that.”

Lightfoot noted cities around the world are developing apps specifically for contact tracing. She said she talked Monday with the mayor of Hamburg, Germany.

“The German government is working on an app that will automatically be able to do and facilitate contact tracing on the basis of proximity to somebody who is subsequently tested positive. The app will collect information about who you’ve been in contact with, then automatically send out an alert,” Lightfoot said.

“Technology is the real tool that we’re gonna need to effectively do contact tracing. We’ll be looking to examples from anywhere that we think really have a lot of possibilities for us here in Chicago.”

For now, those who register for the app will get: text messages tailored to their symptoms; information about where and when to seek medical care and alerts about where and when testing is available. Anti-body testing is still being developed, but will be included once it is available.

The app can be accessed at www.Chicago.gov/covidcoach via smartphone or desktop computer. It is web-based, so there is no need to download anything.

But the numbers, published weekly, appear to be a lagging indicator of what is actually happening around the state — meaning the actual count could be higher. For example, one South Side nursing home has publicized far higher numbers than reported by the state Friday. A spokeswoman for Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the numbers released earlier by the individual nursing homes are reliable.

The new numbers reflect 4,298 coronavirus cases and 625 deaths in nursing homes across the state, according to a count by the Chicago Sun-Times. Pritzker’s office first released nursing home numbers last week, which showed 1,860 residents and staff members had tested positive. Of those, 286 had died.

“It should not come as a surprise to anyone,” Citadel Healthcare CEO Jonathan Aaron said during an online press conference Friday. “Because the state expanded testing this week, and some operators also partnered with hospitals to test every resident and every employee.”

Aaron warned the state’s new numbers would reflect a surge. But he also called the state’s data “a limited snapshot.”

“This virus moves silently and more quickly than we can, making data outdated even at the time of posting,” said Aaron, whose organization is also a member of the Health Care Council of Illinois.

The state says it is gathering data on long-term care facilities on a rolling basis from two national databases, with a slight lag in the numbers that hit its website. Aaron also acknowledged “reasonable delays in reporting,” given the rapid spread of the virus. But he said Citadel Healthcare is following the state’s reporting requirements.

Symphony Care Network spokeswoman Natalie Bauer Luce said earlier this week that 111 residents at Symphony South Shore had contracted the coronavirus, and 10 residents there had died from the disease. But the state’s numbers released Friday only show that the facility had 35 coronavirus cases and two deaths.

Luce said earlier this week that long-term care facilities are required to notify the state and local health departments upon the diagnosis of a resident or staff member. Aaron said Citadel reports every case within 12 hours.

The numbers released Friday would indicate more than a third of COVID-19 deaths in Illinois are tied to senior facilities, up from a quarter of all deaths last week. Though Aaron said the state’s testing at nursing homes is “deeply appreciated,” he called it belated and “off to a slow start.”

“We urge the state to shift to rapid-response, mobile laboratories operated by the National Guard,” Aaron said, adding, “our residents deserve coordinated widespread testing.”

Trump noted Thursday that researchers were looking at the effects of disinfectants on the virus and wondered aloud if they could be injected into people, saying the virus “does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that.”

That prompted a strong warning from the maker of disinfectants Lysol and Dettol, which said it was issuing a statement to combat “recent speculation.”

“As a global leader in health and hygiene products, we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route),” said the statement from Reckitt Benckiser.

The White House accused the media of misrepresenting Trump’s comment.

“President Trump has repeatedly said that Americans should consult with medical doctors regarding coronavirus treatment, a point that he emphasized again during yesterday’s briefing,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement Friday. “Leave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines.”

Researchers are testing the effect of disinfectants on virus-laden saliva and respiratory fluids in the laboratory, said William Bryan, who leads the Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security. They kill the virus very quickly, he said.

“And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning,” Trump said. “Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that. So, that, you’re going to have to use medical doctors with. But it sounds — it sounds interesting to me.”

Bryan said injections weren’t part of that disinfectant research.

The president has often talked up prospects for new therapies and offered rosy timelines for the development of a vaccine as he encourages states to move to reopen their economies.

On Thursday, the White House also pitched “emerging” research on the benefits of sunlight and humidity in diminishing the threat of the coronavirus.

Past studies have not found good evidence that the warmer temperatures and higher humidity of spring and summer will help tamp down the spread of the virus.

But Bryan said at a White House briefing Thursday that there are “emerging results” from new research that suggest solar light has a powerful effect in killing the virus on surfaces and in the air. He said scientists have seen a similar effect from higher temperatures and humidity. A biocontainment lab in Maryland has been conducting testing on the virus since February, Bryan said.

“The virus is dying at a much more rapid pace just from exposure to higher temperatures and just from exposure to humidity,” Bryan said.

Trump was asked if it was dangerous to make people think they would be safe by going outside in the heat, considering that so many people have died in Florida.

“I hope people enjoy the sun. And if it has an impact, that’s great,” Trump replied, adding, “It’s just a suggestion from a brilliant lab by a very, very smart, perhaps brilliant man.”

“I’m here to present ideas, because we want ideas to get rid of this thing. And if heat is good, and if sunlight is good, that’s a great thing as far as I’m concerned,” the president said.

Bryan stressed that the emerging results of the light and heat studies do not replace social distancing recommendations.

Earlier in the month, scientific advisers told the White House there’s no good evidence yet that the heat and humidity of summer will rein in the virus without continued public health measures.

Researchers convened by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine analyzed studies done so far to test virus survival under different laboratory conditions as well as tracking where and how COVID-19 has spread so far.

“Given that countries currently in ‘summer’ climates, such as Australia and Iran, are experiencing rapid virus spread, a decrease in cases with increases in humidity and temperature elsewhere should not be assumed,” the researchers wrote earlier in April in response to questions from the White House Office of Science and Technology.

In addition, the report cited the global lack of immunity to the new virus and concluded, “if there is an effect of temperature and humidity on transmission, it may not be as apparent as with other respiratory viruses for which there is at least some preexisting partial immunity.”

They noted that during 10 previous flu pandemics, regardless of what season they started, all had a peak second wave about six months after the virus first emerged.

In March, Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization’s emergencies chief. said, “We have to assume that the virus will continue to have the capacity to spread, and it’s a false hope to say yes, it will just disappear in the summertime like influenza.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Standing outside the Water Tower, which survived the Great Chicago Fire, Lightfoot announced a COVID-19 Recovery Task Force co-chaired by the mayor along with her longtime friend Sam Skinner.

Skinner served as White House chief of staff and U.S. Transportation Secretary under former President George H.W. Bush. He is also a former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois.

“We don’t know when this crisis will end. … But what we do know is that, when it comes to recovering from this crisis, there are no half-measures. No cutting corners. … The crisis we face today is like nothing any of us have ever experienced. … What we are embarking on is nothing less than the most breathtaking recovery effort our city has ever seen,” the mayor said.

With the statewide stay-at-home order extended to June 1, Lightfoot acknowledged Chicago is “still very much in the thick of the fight” and a “long way from being out of the woods.”

“At the same time, we need to plan in a thoughtful, deliberative way about what the future is gonna look like at the neighborhood level, at the block level, but also at the city and the regional level. That’s what this task force is all about: Assessing the damage that’s been done, the harm — both in economic and … emotional terms — and building a framework for us to transition out of stay-at-home when that time is right,” she said.

The task force the mayor has assembled is a virtual who’s-who of Chicago power brokers.

It will be divided into five working groups: Policy and Economic Stimulus; Mental and Emotional Health; Marketing and Business Development; Regional Coordination; and Economic Change Study.

The Regional Coordination group includes Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, who was swamped by Lightfoot in the 2019 mayoral runoff and has had a frosty relationship with the mayor ever since.

Preckwinkle applauded Lightfoot for her “strong leadership” and said it makes sense for a city and county that “share labor markets and supply chains” to work together.

She stressed the need for a recovery focused heavily on “the devastating impact” the virus has had on “black and brown communities.”

“This pandemic has forced millions of people in the region out of their jobs, with the most vulnerable communities being the hardest hit. Small businesses, not-for-profit organizations, gig workers, artists and independent contractors are experiencing unprecedented challenges and many of them are in the fight of their lives to stay operational. Recovery is paramount to all of us now,” Preckwinkle said.

“There’s no silver bullet for turning things around. But I’m convinced that we can improve our regional outlook through collaborative efforts. Regions with the least inequality perform the best. And for this to happen, we need to work together to drive this change.”

Chicago Federation of Labor President Bob Reiter will serve on a Policy and Economic Stimulus working group that includes Mellody Hobson, co-CEO of Ariel Investments and vice-chair of World Business Chicago. The Federation of Labor has an ownership stake in Sun-Times Media.

Reiter said essential workers on the front lines during the pandemic “need more than just a ‘Thank you.’ Working people need an ambitious plan for recovery that will not just return workers to the pre-pandemic status-quo, but strengthen worker protections and shape a new era of prosperity for the working class of Chicago.”

Alexa James, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness Chicago, will serve on the working group for Mental and Emotional Health.

She called the pandemic impact “deep and complicated” — even on those who have lost no one they love to the virus and still have jobs and paychecks while working from home.

“Nearly everyone can identify with the fear and anxiety caused by the shutdown of our city and our economy. ... There is real grief in peoples’ hearts about what we have lost and what has changed. Whether it’s missing milestones like high school graduations and weddings, financial insecurity and instability — we are all feeling a tremendous sense of loss,” James said.

“The fears that people may have will continue, even when the stay-at-home order is lifted. Recovering from this crisis won’t be easy. … We will need to recognize the trauma that the city has faced … [and] plan a response to the long-term impact this crisis will have on the emotional health of our community.”

After introducing the task force, Lightfoot openly acknowledged Chicago Public Schools are planning for at least the possibility that remote learning may need to extend into the fall and the new school year.

“We know that … sometime in early 2021 at the earliest before there’s a vaccine. So, we have to be prepared for a lot of different contingencies, including the worst-case contingency,” she said

“We want to make sure that our children learn. … We want to stand up systems and structures now to be prepared, but also to continue to support our young people in particular because this is really, really difficult stuff on them.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

J.B. Pritzker said the state needed to process 10,000 coronavirus tests each day to get ahead of the outbreak gripping Illinois, average daily testing numbers are still 40 percent short of that goal.

While Pritzker and the federal government say the state now has the machines needed to conduct thousands of more tests, a shortage in necessary supplies to actually process those tests has limited how many can actually be completed, officials say.

What’s more, some national projections adjusted for Illinois’ population suggest the state may need to process roughly 15,000 to 900,000 tests a day to be able to confidently chart the next steps toward returning to normal. Some experts say more tests are needed to screen individuals without symptoms who could unwittingly spread the disease and check people who are considered high-risk multiple times.

“We will never, ever get out of the stay-at-home order unless we do massive amounts of testing of those people at highest risk for COVID-19,” said Dr. Howard Ehrman, a former deputy commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health. “If Pritzker takes us out of the stay-at-home order before enough testing is done, either partially or completely, then thousands of more people will get infected and die.”

Dr. Robert Murphy, executive director of Northwestern University’s Institute of Global Health, agrees that it’s vital to ramp up testing to understand the true reach of the virus, isolate those who are infected, enable public health workers to trace the contacts of those who have been infected and ultimately get Americans back to work.

“Anybody should be able to be tested,” said Murphy.

However, he acknowledged the state — and nation — are a long way from being able to do that.

Goal set weeks ago

On March 29, Pritzker told reporters that he hoped the state would scale its testing capacity from roughly 4,000 tests a day at the time to the elusive 10,000 mark in just 10 days, or by April 9.

But since that deadline — a period in which Pritzker updated the state’s criteria for testing to include anyone with symptoms and additional sites started testing — an average of only 6,149 daily tests were reported. Nearly 8,600 tests were done on April 12, the most on any single day, but the number has dropped again, including on Tuesday when 6,639 tests had been processed in the previous 24 hours.

“There isn’t enough testing and there won’t be for some time to really open everything up,” Pritzker said during his daily press briefing. “And the fact that we’re going to need a whole lot more means we have to leave things still in a place that seems not normal to everybody and won’t be for some time.”

Illinois isn’t the only state struggling to run more tests, though. The lack of widespread testing has remained a critical issue since COVID-19 was first detected in the U.S. in January, and failures on the federal level appear to have set the country back as the deadly virus took hold.

Considerable steps have since been taken to bolster the country’s testing capacity: New diagnostic tests have been rolled out, more testing sites have cropped up and major commercial labs are now processing results.

Supply shortage

But whether having more capacity is enough to boost the actual number of tests taken and processed is another question.

President Donald Trump continues to spar with several governors as his administration insists that states aren’t utilizing their entire testing capacity based on the number of testing machines at hospitals and labs. Illinois, for example, has enough machines to run 16,000 to 30,000 tests a day, the federal government said in documents released Monday.

Pritzker pushed back, noting that states require more swabs to take samples from people, and more materials to transport those samples to labs and process them. He has not made a new estimate on when the state could reach the 10,000-test threshold.

Murphy said making sure the states have enough supplies to increase testing is “obviously a federal thing. ... The supply chain involves multiple states and even multiple countries, so who can coordinate that?”

10,000 not enough?

Even once the state gets to 10,000 tests a day, that isn’t enough to truly return things to normal, some experts said.

The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank based in Washington, D.C., is calling for 371,000 daily tests, while former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottleib holds that 430,000 coronavirus tests should be processed each day, according to a report released Friday by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. Meanwhile, Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Romer believes half the country should get tested each week, amounting to 23 million tests a day.

Adjusting those models for Illinois’ population of 12.67 million, or roughly 3.9% of the national populace, the state would have to process between 14,469 and 897,000 tests each day.

“There is not yet consensus over what approach to testing is required for social distancing measures to be loosened, or exactly how much capacity is needed,” the Kaiser report stated. “But, by any measure, it is clear that we are far from being able to do enough tests to enable us to move to the next phase of responding to the pandemic in states across the country.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The mayor’s “hyper-local, data-informed” strategy will be focused, at least initially, on three hard-hit neighborhoods: Austin, Auburn-Gresham and South Shore.

The unprecedented outreach by Lightfoot’s so-called “racial equity rapid response teams” includes expanded testing and free distribution of 60,000 masks, 80,000 door hangers and 150,000 postcards.

The goal is to “pro-actively reach” African Americans at greatest risk of contracting the coronavirus because of their age, their underlying health conditions or the fact that they are “essential” employees who cannot afford to stay safe at home.

To spread the message, the city is holding three, 90-minute telephone town hall meetings, one in each of the targeted neighborhoods. South Shore is first — on Thursday from 4:30 to 6 p.m. — followed by Auburn Gresham from 10:30 a.m. to noon on Saturday and Austin from 12:30 to 2 p.m.

Targeted public service announcements on radio and television are also planned, once again using comedy as an education vehicle. And rapid response teams operating out of the city’s emergency operations center are talking about “solutions to food insecurity” on the South Side.

When Lightfoot first sounded the alarm about the racial disparity, Africans Americans who comprise 30 percent of Chicago’s population made up 72 percent of COVID-19 deaths.

Now it’s down to a still-alarming 60% — that’s 287 of Chicago’s 500 deaths, according to Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady.

The death rate among African Americans in Chicago remains four times higher than it is for whites, the commissioner said.

For a mayor who declared war on poverty before the pandemic, that is simply unacceptable.

“The health disparities that result in high rates of diabetes, heart and respiratory disease are the very conditions that this virus ruthlessly attacks,” the mayor told a City Hall news conference.

Lightfoot said the maps of coronavirus cases concentrated in black neighborhood “illuminated the broken and racist system of inequality that has held these same communities in the grip of poverty for generations” in Chicago.

“That has withheld access to health care, jobs and education. … The very issues that placed incredible burdens on our families before this crisis have only grown exponentially during this crisis — and thrust into high relief how the issues of equity and opportunity are truly matters of life and death,” she said.

“We simply will not stand for that here in Chicago. Not anymore.”

Carlos Nelson, CEO of the Greater Auburn Gresham Development Corporation, said he’s spent the last 3.5 years planning a 60,000-square-foot regional health and wellness center anchored by a full-service health center at 79th and Halsted streets.

“We purchased the building. We’ve had difficulty finding the last of the funds to get this project done. It’s frustrating and it’s sobering to think how many families would have been supported — and possibly lives saved — if we’d been able to stand up this Auburn-Gresham health and wellness center,” Nelson said.

“When this pandemic is over, it is imperative that we as a great community continue to fight other long-standing epidemics — like poverty, like food instability, like little access to health care and other social determinants of health — with the same vigor that we’re fighting right now.”

Darnell Shields, executive director of Austin Coming Together, openly acknowledged that it will be an uphill battle.

“Social determinants of good health are not in our favor. The number of pre-existing health conditions that plague the black community as a result of extreme poverty [and] systemic racism make us more susceptible to the dangers of COVID-19,” Shields said.

Long before the COVID-19 pandemic, Lightfoot and Arwady were determined to narrow the nine-year gap in life expectancy between black and white Chicagoans.

The so-called “death gap” between people who live downtown compared to parts of the West Side is an even more astounding 16 years.

Her goal now is to “break down silos” of poverty — and establish food delivery systems to impoverished Chicago neighborhoods — in a way that will last long after life in Chicago returns to some semblance of normalcy.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

There are also 1,151 new cases, bringing the state’s total to 31,508 positive cases. The state has lost 1,349 people to the outbreak, and the virus is now in 95 of the state’s 102 counties, officials said. There were 5,040 tests conducted on Sunday, although private labs have not been reporting results on Sundays.

The percentage of ICU beds in Illinois used by COVID-19 patients has remained steady at 40%, and the percentage of ventilators being used by those patients is actually declining slightly, now standing at 23%, Pritzker said.

At his daily briefing, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker warned case numbers are rising — but at a slower rate.

“Our curve is bending the right way,” Pritzker said. “With the current mitigation strategies in place, we may not have reached out peak yet, but your actions are helping to keep that peak as low as possible.”

He added that without the drastic mitigation efforts that have been implemented, “we would have required thousands more ventilators beyond our initial capacity.”

Pritzker said the state hasn’t “quite hit the peak yet.”

“And you won’t really know if you’ve hit the peak until you start to go down,” the governor said.

According to Pritzker’s office, 757 patients were on ventilators as of midnight on Sunday. On Saturday, there were 749 ventilators being used; on Friday, there were 738.

In total, there are 1,239 COVID-19 ICU patients in Illinois hospitals, up slightly from Friday, when 1,192 coronavirus patients were hospitalized in the ICU, his office said. There were 4,599 COVID-19 patients in total in hospitals on Sunday, up from 4,340 on Friday.

After two days of a record high 125 deaths last week, the state reported 33 deaths Sunday.

Illinois residents are abiding by a stay-at-home executive order that expires on April 30. But an extension is anticipated. Pritzker on Friday ordered all Illinois schools closed to in-person learning for the remainder of the school year.

Pritzker has remained tight-lipped about an extension, just as he was before announcing the first executive order.

“A lot of this has to do with looking at every aspect of the order and seeing all of the things that we might change,” Pritzker said. “We’re looking at it, working on it every day. I promise you that I will be out here and tell you as soon as I can.”

The governor was also asked if the state might re-open region by region. He signaled that is a possibility.

“I absolutely think that we need to look at where the capacity exists. For example if the hospital capacity in a certain area is quite large and very available, even with coronavirus in existence, then that might be a place where you could do more than some other place. What’s most important, though, is keeping people safe and healthy,” Pritzker said, adding social distancing is a very different concept for those in rural areas than those “on the North Side or the West Side of Chicago.”

Pritzker said he is speaking with medical experts “and we’re trying to follow that advice and look at how best to give people the most freedom, while also making sure people are healthy.”

The governor also said some of the federal guidelines for re-opening the country “are worth looking at,” including the notion that getting past the peak equates to 14 days of numbers going down.

Pritzker offered other hospitalization numbers at the daily briefing, as well. The state on Sunday released data showing 1,860 residents and staff members at state long-term care facilities have tested positive for COVID-19, and 286 of them have died.

Long-term care facilities in Cook County have by far seen the largest number of cases and deaths. The data show 804 people related to Cook County nursing homes have tested positive for the coronavirus, with 146 of them succumbing to the disease.

Pritzker outlined some state procedures for COVID-19 cases in nursing homes, including treating any symptomatic residents or staff as confirmed cases, if there is already a confirmed case at the home. He said nursing home workers “are considered healthcare workers” and have access to testing at the state’s drive-thru sites and other hospital locations that prioritize first responders.

The governor said the state is also working on testing all residents and staff at nursing homes.

“We’re prioritizing testing at long-term care facilities that are home to our populations where a COVID infection is more likely to lead to higher-severity cases, especially among black and brown communities,” Pritzker said. “This testing at non-COVID facilities will allow us to identify early the presence of COVID-19 in a facility and isolate those cases before widespread transmission.”

The state is working with the Illinois National Guard and the Illinois Department of Transportation to ramp up testing at the state’s nursing homes.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Dr. Robert Murphy, executive director of Northwestern University’s Institute of Global Health, warned that those disobeying the statewide stay-at-home order are exacerbating the public health crisis as he blasted the forces pushing to immediately reopen the economy.

“Look on the street. Only half of the people are wearing a mask,” Murphy said Wednesday. “There’s data from the phone companies about how people move. They’re moving around more. There’s definitely more traffic.”

While he said the pervasive toll is also attributable in part to increased testing and workers returning to their jobs, Murphy noted that keeping social distancing measures in place longer — and following them — is vitally important for beating back the coronavirus.

Recent figures have shown the disease is still spreading rapidly through communities. On Tuesday, state officials reported 4,014 new cases of COVID-19, the most recorded in a single day. And on Wednesday, the 192 reported deaths marked another grim benchmark.

“The same thing happened in northern Italy and in Spain, where they just felt like they were not getting ahead,” Murphy said. “It finally turned around there when they got serious with all the shelter-in-place.

“But I mean, everybody here seems to be just ready to chuck it and just go back to doing what they’re doing.”

Murphy specifically took aim at leaders pushing to relax restrictions locally. As he sees it, the clearest way to vanquish the disease is actually to “tighten it up.”

“They should not be loosening up. You know, like McHenry County and DuPage County want to have their own rules. Idiots!” he said, apparently referencing a push by leaders in the collar counties to be moved into a region in the governor’s Restore Illinois plan that doesn’t include Cook County in hopes they can reopen businesses sooner.

Meanwhile, both Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike spent a good portion of Wednesday’s news conference harping on the fact that the virus remains a real and serious threat.

“This virus is still among us,” Pritzker said. “This pandemic is not over. And to pretend otherwise in a misguided attempt to reclaim what we’ve lost will only make this last longer.”

But even Murphy, a noted expert on infectious diseases, is struggling to truly understand the disease that has killed thousands across the state.

“We are grateful to the frontline responders who are risking their well-being to protect Chicago neighborhoods,” said Citadel Securities CEO Peng Zhao, who organized the donation with his wife Cherry Chen.

The effort follows months of President Donald Trump blaming China for the pandemic.

On Monday, when a Chinese American reporter asked the president why he sees testing for the coronavirus as a “global competition,” he responded, “Maybe that’s a question you should ask China.” On Tuesday, Trump tweeted: “Asian Americans are VERY angry at what China has done to our Country, and the World. Chinese Americans are the most angry of all.”

Zhao and more than a dozen other Chinese American business leaders bought the masks and asked the University of Chicago Crime Lab to help distribute them.

About 750,000 of the masks are going to the Chicago Department of Public Health, which will provide them to Chicago police officers and other city workers who need them, according to the crime lab. More than 500 officers have tested positive for COVID-19, and three have died.

About 100,000 masks will go to the Chicago Public Schools. Masks also are being given to nonprofits that work with at-risk youth.

The distribution of the masks began May 4.

Roseanna Ander, executive director of the crime lab, said the donation comes at a time China is under fire by Trump and others and said, “We all have a common enemy in COVID-19 and a shared interest in stopping its spread, protecting our brave frontline responders and ultimately finding a vaccine.”

Ken Griffin, founder of Citadel and Chicago’s richest man, is paying for cleaning supplies and medical equipment for cops and other first-responders. He also donated $2.5 million to feed Chicago schoolchildren during the pandemic.

The City Council unanimously approved a fair workweek ordinance last summer that requires large Chicago employers to give employees at least two weeks’ notice of their schedules and compensate them for last-minute changes.

At a virtual meeting Monday, the City’s Council Committee on Workforce Development agreed to ease up a bit to recognize many businesses may not survive the stay-at-home shutdown of the Chicago economy.

The amendment approved Monday after a rare direct introduction by Mayor Lori Lightfoot would postpone until Jan. 1 the “private cause of action” section that allows aggrieved workers whose schedules are changed without adequate notice or compensation to file their own lawsuits.

“We understand that all businesses are struggling due to the COVID outbreak. This will allow businesses to implement fair workweek policy without fear of lawsuits during the first six months of the regulations,” said Rosa Escareno, Business Affairs and Consumer Protection commissioner.

Escareno stressed the predictable scheduling ordinance will still take effect July 1. “During this pandemic, worker protections are more important than ever before. We owe it to the hundreds of thousands of essential workers that have kept the city running,” Escareno said. “Now is not the time to sacrifice the hard-earned [protections] we have already put in place to support our workers.”

Zoning Committee Chairman Tom Tunney (44th), owner of Ann Sather’s Restaurants, acknowledged the ordinance applies only to businesses with 100 or more employees, restaurants with at least 30 locations and 250 employees globally, and to franchisees with four or more locations.

But Tunney warned of the dangers of imposing the mandate as the Chicago economy slowly reopens under the five-step plans unveiled by the mayor and the governor.

“Our biggest challenge is going to be having a two-week forecast of what demand will be like under what phase. That’s gonna be a very complicated phase-in of employees,” Tunney said.

“It’s just one more disincentive to bring people back. I’m being honest with you. As you phase in, you’re only gonna bring your top, top employees. The least amount that you need to run the business. This, among other things, is going to be a real drag on employment for all workers.”

The anti-retaliation ordinance championed by the mayor and approved by the Workforce Development Committee is tailored to protect workers from being fired, suspended, transferred or having their pay cut because of absences tied to the coronavirus.

The protections would apply to workers who stay home because they have COVID-19 symptoms, have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for the virus, or their business is deemed nonessential by statewide stay-at-home order.

“We wish this ordinance was not necessary. And the fact is that the vast majority of our businesses in Chicago have proven themselves to be good actors and have already offered this protection to their workers. But all Chicago workers should be guaranteed job safety as they do their part to keep our community safe,” Escareno said.

“This is more important than ever to ensure that proper protections are in place for our most vulnerable workers — especially as they get ready to begin the road to recovery. Worker rights need to be at the forefront of our plan to protect Chicago in our plan to reopen sooner, rather than later.”

Andy Fox, director of the city’s new Office of Labor Standards, said the city has received 32 complaints of retaliation against workers who stayed home during the pandemic.

The anti-retaliation ordinance would also apply to camp counselors and domestic workers. And employers would have 30-days to “cure” the violation before penalties are imposed.

Ald. Mike Rodriguez (22nd) said he’s concerned documentation required to justify COVID-19-related absences may be “unachievable” for undocumented workers and those in low-wage jobs.

Fox assured the alderman the ordinance allows for “self-certification.”

“If the employee was able to produce a written note, a text — some communication that says, ‘I’m home. My doctor told me to be home. I’m quarantining’ — that would be enough for us to find this is a COVID-related instance. And if an employer took adverse action against them, we’d be able to investigate it and initiate an enforcement action,” Fox said.

“It is a slippery slope. We’d like something concrete to tie to it because it could be ripe for abuse if someone simply didn’t want to go to work. We want some communication with a medical provider.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Many economists predicted a V-shaped journey for the economy: A sharp drop, then a quick bounce-back as the virus faded and the economy regained health.

Others envisioned a slower, U-shaped course.

Now, as President Donald Trump and many Republicans press to reopen the economy, some experts see an ominous risk: That a too-hasty relaxation of social distancing could ignite a resurgence of COVID-19 cases by fall, sending the economy back into lockdown. The result: a W-shaped disaster in which a tentative recovery would sink back into a “double-dip” recession before rebounding eventually.

“The push to reopen the economy is making a W-shaped recovery very much more likely,” said Jeffrey Frankel, professor of capital formation and growth at the Harvard Kennedy School.

In Frankel’s view, any widespread reopening should wait for a sustained drop in death rates and the broad availability of tests. No one is completely safe until an effective treatment or vaccine can be produced and widely distributed — a scenario that’s likely many months away.

Frankel said he also worries that the government might prematurely withdraw financial aid to the economy, thereby weakening the pillars of any tentative recovery.

“A W-shaped recovery is a distinct possibility,” said Yongseok Shin, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis and a research fellow at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. “Unless the reopening is carefully managed with extensive testing and voluntary social distancing, infections will rapidly rise in many localities.

“People will then hunker down for fear of infection, and local governments will re-impose lockdowns, quashing any economic recovery we will have had to that point.’’

A double-dip recession would significantly heighten the risks for an already debilitated U.S. economy. Congress has provided roughly $3 trillion in aid — by far its largest rescue ever — to help households and companies survive the next few months. That short-term aid, though, assumes any recovery will last. If a second downturn were to flare up, it’s far from clear that Congress would be ready to offer trillions more to enable businesses to survive yet another round of months-long shutdowns.

Nor do many companies have the cash reserves to cushion against a second recession. And just as threatening, a double-tip downturn would sap the confidence of individuals and businesses that is essential to an economic bounce-back. If consumers don’t trust that a recovery will last, many won’t resume spending, and the economy would struggle to rebound.

On Monday, plastic spacing barriers and millions of masks appeared on the streets of Europe’s newly reopened cities as France and Belgium emerged from lockdowns, the Netherlands sent children back to school and Spain allowed people to eat outdoors. All faced the delicate balance of restarting battered economies without causing a second wave of coronavirus infections.

In the United States, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has urged caution in reopening the economy. Powell has warned against taking “too much risk of second and third waves’’ of the virus.

For now, the economy is essentially in free-fall. It shed a record 20.5 million jobs in April. The unemployment rate surged to 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression. The gross domestic product — the broadest measure of output — shrank at a 4.8% annual rate from January through March and is expected to post an astounding 40% annual collapse in the current quarter. That would be, by far, the worst on record dating to 1947.

Facing a catastrophe in an election year, Trump and many Republican allies are eager to ease restrictions and restart the economy. They say the use of masks and other protections should allow many businesses to safely reopen under certain guidelines. Trump has openly backed protests that are intended to compel governors to “liberate’’ their states from lockdowns.

But The Associated Press reported last week that many U.S. governors are disregarding White House guidelines. Seventeen states didn’t meet a key benchmark set by the White House for beginning to reopen businesses: A 14-day downward trajectory in new cases or positive test rates.

Texas’ Republican lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, has gone so far as to suggest that restarting the economy might be worth the risk of some additional deaths.

“There are more important things than living,’’ Patrick said in an interview with Fox News. “I don’t want to die, nobody wants to die, but man, we got to take some risks and get back in the game and get this country back up and running.”

Most Americans say they’re wary of trying to return to business as normal now. A Pew Research Center survey found that 68% said they feared that state governments would lift restrictions too soon. Just 31% wanted restrictions lifted sooner.

“The idea that you just turn the spigot back on is just ridiculous,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the consulting firm Grant Thornton. ”It’s still a COVID-tainted spigot. No one wants water from a poisoned well.’’

Many businesses are also tempering their optimism. The data firm Womply found that even in Texas and Florida, states that are being especially aggressive about reopening their economies, businesses are moving slowly. Womply found only a “small-to-negligible drop’’ in the share of Texas and Florida businesses that remain closed.

“This could signal that previously closed businesses may have trouble figuring out how to open with new guidelines, attracting patrons, or may be closed indefinitely,” Womply concluded.

At Big Buzz, a health care marketing consultancy in Denver, CEO Wendy Phillips is expecting “more a W-shaped than a V-shaped’’ rebound. Phillips has reduced her staff from eight to six, two of whom kept their full-time jobs only after the government delivered a $105,000 loan under a rescue program for small businesses.

“There’s so much unknown looking forward,’’ Phillips said. “I think it’s going to be a good two or three years, at a minimum, of recession.’’

Frankel at the Harvard Kennedy School and others worry that state and local governments, hemorrhaging tax revenue, will be forced to make growth-stunting cuts just as a recovery might be straining to gain traction.

Another threat is the prospect of bankruptcies and cash shortfalls for companies and households. Some have been able to defer rent and other payments but will eventually have to repay their landlords and other creditors in full.

Likewise, U.S. authorities declared premature victory over the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak, only to see it return, deadlier than before. In the current pandemic, South Korea eased restrictions as cases dropped. But on Saturday, Seoul had to shut down nightclubs, bars and discos after dozens of infections were linked to club goers.

Last week, researchers at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health warned that easing stay-at-home orders and allowing people to mingle more freely would mean that “new COVID-19 cases and deaths will rebound in late May.’’

The Columbia researchers predict a resurgence of cases two to four weeks after states begin to reopen.

“The lag between infection acquisition and case confirmation, coupled with insufficient testing and contact tracing, will mask any rebound and exponential growth of COVID-19 until it is well underway,” said the lead researcher, Jeffrey Shaman.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Since mid-March he’s been told his business, Tonsor Barbershop, 3935 N. Pulaski Rd., was non-essential and should be closed to limit the spread of COVID-19. Now, somehow, golf courses are more important?

“I mean, the whole essential and non-essential thing bugs me because I’ve seen people in the media and people in government with new haircuts,” Santa said. “Why are their haircuts more important than that of grocery workers and nurses?”

On Tuesday, Gov. J.B. Pritzker unveiled a five-phased plan for reopening the state. It won’t be until the third phase — called “recovery” — that barbershops and salons will be able to reopen, with restrictions. A Chicago plan unveiled Friday by Mayor Lori Lightfoot has similar steps.

There isn’t a timetable for implementing Phase Three. It depends on how many COVID-19 patients are admitted to hospitals or need ICU beds; both numbers must be stable or declining.

“It doesn’t make sense to me that we have to stay on the sideline,” Santa said. “We’ve been trained in the highest levels of sanitation and sterilization.”

Most of his barbers wore gloves and masks before the pandemic forced his business to shutter, he said. It’s also an appointment-based shop, so he can limit how many people enter.

Barbers’ sole income relies on breaking social-distancing rules, and unlike restaurants or retail stores, barbers can’t pivot to delivery or curbside pick-ups.

Santa doesn’t minimize the threat of COVID-19 and believes it’s important to flatten the curve. But the absence of support from the state and federal government has triggered a bit of desperation.

Santa has applied for about five different loans and grants since mid-March, including the Small Business Association’s Paycheck Protection Program.

He has yet to receive any assistance.

“I’m a taxpayer,” Santa said. “I don’t understand why I’m not receiving any help.”

Self-employed workers like barbers typically don’t qualify for unemployment benefits because they don’t pay into unemployment insurance, but they are eligible for the PPP program.

To be approved for that program, Santa first had to file for regular unemployment to confirm he was eligible for nothing — which he did.

But he still can’t apply to the pandemic unemployment program until the portal opens on May 11 — almost two months after the first stay-at-home order was issued.

He’s hoping to get aid quickly so he can pay his May rent.

“It’s pretty stressful because I thought by now, I would’ve gotten some help.” Santa said.

Damon Dorsey, president of the American Barber Association, said COVID-19 hit barbershops across the country like a “tsunami.” It’s an industry filled with small neighborhood shops, and the lack of government help has created a level of anxiety never seen before, he said.

He would like to see shops open but under strict guidelines, such as appointment-based services only; mandatory masks and gloves for barbers and clients; and constant sanitization of shops.

“It would be great to have programs in place that could help barbers, but barbers aren’t seeing any of these benefits that are out there,” Dorsey said. “For example, none of our members received any support from the [Paycheck Protection Program].”

Dorsey said the loss of revenue have driven many barbers into the shadows and defying state orders.

Chris Turcios, owner of Headquarters Barber Studio, 3040 W. Irving Park Road, said he’s cut hair secretly since the stay-at-home order was issued. Some of those clandestine haircuts were police officers.

“I barely just got my stimulus check yesterday,” Turcios said Friday. “We are taking risks by doing these appointments, but I’m about to be three months behind on rent and have $2,000 in other bills.

“What else am I supposed to do?”

Turcios, who also has applied for government assistance, said he is now relying on crowdsourced funding to support him and his staff. He recently asked his 1,700 friends on Facebook to donate just $2.

Despite the uncertainty, Turcios has created a plan for when he is allowed to reopen. This includes moving barber stations farther away from each other, removing their waiting area and allowing only 10 people into the shop at a time.

“This is a scary moment, scary that I might have to close,” Turcios said. “Man, we just want to be able to provide for our families.”

“The pandemic has uncovered some ugly truths about the lack of access to good healthcare and affordable housing in the black community,” says Beckham, who’s lived in Bronzeville on and off for 55 years. “I’ve always focused on providing what’s needed in my neighborhood. A lot of people have moved away. My goal is to bring them back.”

That’s Leon Walker’s aim, too.

“We want to encourage others who grew up in these communities, like I did, to invest in the neighborhood,” says Walker, another South Side developer. “Now is the time to return home.“

A growing consensus among Chicago developers and planners seems to be that concentrated, block-by-block redevelopment is the surest way to bring in the people and businesses needed to strengthen the city’s black communities, which have disproportionately borne the brunt of COVID-19.

Beckham’s current project is 43 Green, a mixed-use development centered around the 43rd Street CTA Green Line stop being done as a joint venture with the Habitat Company,. The first phase of the project, to be built on a city-owned lot, calls for an eight-story building with 91 apartments — half affordable housing, half market rate — built over ground-floor shops.

If that goes well, Beckham plans two other buildings nearby. A townhouse development by another builder recently was completed across the street.

“It’s all about density,” Beckham says. “That’s a major part of keeping retail strong.”

A good retail mix will attract new residents.

“A lot of young professionals live elsewhere in Chicago because they can’t find the amenities they want in Bronzeville,” Beckham says. “Our focus is to add some spark and bring in new faces and energy.”

City Hall seems to have come to the same realization. Mayor Lori Lightfoot has created the INVEST South/West program to catalyze redevelopment of commercial corridors in 10 neighborhoods on the South Side and West Side. Unlike previous, scattershot efforts, the idea is to focus economic development efforts in selected areas, signaling to private business interests that these are good places to invest.

“Revitalization strategies work best when you get synergy,” says Maurice Cox, the city’s commissioner of planning and development. “You have to create an ecosystem, with one investment next to another. That generates momentum and encourages others to join you.”

The most promising of the 10 targeted communities is greater Bronzeville, from Lake Michigan to the Dan Ryan Expressway and 26th Street to 51st Street. The area has many strengths, including a committed middle-class base. What it doesn’t have is a thriving commercial district.

It needs one to improve the quality of life for current residents and to help the neighborhood — and ultimately the whole South Side — attract newcomers.

Bringing in new people is essential. The 2020 census is likely to show that Chicago lost more than 135,000 black residents over the past decade, offsetting population gains by other groups. That’s on top of a decline of 181,000 black people in the 2010 census.

It’s not enough to just stop those losses. Lightfoot says she wants to boost Chicago’s population to 3 million — 300,000 more than now.

To do that, the city needs to draw people from elsewhere. Looking to the past as a guide, it will largely be college graduates who decide to make Chicago their new home. The percentage of Chicagoans with college degrees has grown from 17% in 1980 to almost 40% now. But most of those college grads weren’t born in Chicago. According to census data, 56% weren’t even born in Illinois.

Of the Illinois college grads, a reasonable assumption is that the number from Chicago reflects the city’s share of the state’s population. That means 90% of college grads now living in Chicago — the chief drivers of the city’s resurgence — were born elsewhere.

The challenge is to make the South Side as attractive as other parts of the city to college grads.

It can be done. At a time when Chicago’s African American communities are beset by violent crime and plunging population, the number of black Chicagoans with college degrees is going up, not down. Since 2010, the number of black college grads in the city has increased by about 15,000, or 15%, vs. 27% growth for the city overall. Still, this shows the potential is there.

Neighborhoods all over the South Side and West Side need commercial revitalization. Bronzeville — because of its lakefront location relatively near downtown — is the most important.

In 1980, Chicago’s college grads were mostly clustered in a narrow band along the lakefront. The revitalized area — a collection of neighborhoods with high education and middle income or better — pushed inland from there and now takes in much of the North Side and Northwest Side.

On the south lakefront, progress has been more uneven. Still, with only a couple of gaps, neighborhoods with a high proportion of college grads now extend all the way down to Woodlawn.

If the North Side pattern repeats, once revitalization is firmly established in Bronzeville, it will gradually spread to other parts of the South Side.

A critical step is establishing a lively business district — the equivalent of the Clark Street/Broadway corridor on the North Side.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Broadway was the heart of what was then called New Town. It was — and is — busy and walkable, with lots of shops and people. College grads who moved to Chicago in that era — like me — typically spent at least a few years living in the vicinity. It was their port of entry into Chicago, their first taste of big-city life.

Bronzeville needs a bustling corridor like that if it’s to be a point of entry for college grads moving to the South Side. Now, it has a path to getting one.

Neighborhood redevelopment isn’t the only thing that needs to happen to rebuild the South Side. College grads don’t come to Chicago just because it’s fun. They’re also looking for jobs and opportunity.

Among U.S. metro areas with the most African American residents, the one having the highest percentage of black college grads is Washington, D.C., with 35% — higher than the national average. The reason is the federal government is based there, with its pick of the nation’s top talent.

Chicago doesn’t have that kind of hiring power, but it does have an expanding downtown economy, which could absorb a lot of black college grads.

“There’s a lot of things moving and growing here,” Beckham says. “I’m really happy to be a part of revitalizing my community.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Now he can pop into position group meetings and rookie minicamp sessions, his head floating in a box on the computer screens of his players scattered around the country.

He has found a quiet place in his house and joked that the video game “Fortnite” has done a good job keeping his four sons, ages 12 to 16, occupied.

To spice up meetings, Nagy has guest speakers on so his players don’t tune out the sound of their own coaches’ voice.

He schedules on “Bears Time” — what the clock says in Chicago — but it’s confusing to navigate how time-zone differences affect players training from the West Coast to Florida.

“That’s the biggest obstacle,” he said.

Except for an even bigger one. There remains the existential question about the months ahead — one that’s familiar to businesses across the country during the coronavirus shutdown.

“Here’s probably what the biggest difficulty is, the unknown,” he said Friday. “That’s what’s hard. We’re sitting here, you go through trying to figure out what’s going to happen, whether it be at training camp, whether it be at preseason, the regular season. There’s a lot of unknowns there. That’s OK. We can’t control that. Let’s control what we can control.”

While some NFL teams have considered backup training-camp locations because of state stay-at-home orders, Nagy wouldn’t say if the Bears, who are slated to practice at Halas Hall, were of the same mind.

“Again, that’s one of the unknowns for us. If and when that does happen, we just have to react to it,” he said. “It just seems like every state’s a little different. The league is trying to figure out what to do and whatever they tell us, we’ll do. We’ve been so entrenched in this other stuff.”

Asked whether there will be games in home stadiums this year, Nagy again pled ignorance.

“You’re going to probably say, ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah, that’s coach talk, I don’t believe you,’ ” he said. “But I’m telling you when I tell you this — I have no clue. Whatever they tell us to do, we’ll do.

“We’re just rolling with them and with what they say. We’re staying positive, and we’re just worrying about what the next solution is for whatever they tell us.”

The Bears held a rookie minicamp last week and a voluntary veteran minicamp in late April and early May. The next step of the virtual offseason program, OTAs, start later this month. They’ll feature more full-team meetings, though Nagy has remained flexible based on player feedback.

“You can take everything we’ve done in prior years,” Nagy said, “and you can just throw it out the window.”

Still, he’s trying to embrace what makes this offseason unique.

“There’s been some silver linings,” he said.

Even before the shutdown, the Bears planned to hold more position meetings, believing that installing the offense the last two years robbed their players of more detailed instruction. Nagy pops into them virtually; at Halas Hall, he couldn’t go from room-to-room so quickly.

There’s more time to chat without on-field work, so Bears coaches are getting to know players through what Nagy calls “coffee shops” — virtual meetings to talk about life outside football.

As for the playbook, Nagy said his assistant coaches are offering detailed instruction. That appeals to one of his favorite mantras.

“I love ‘over-communicate clarity’ — I use that all the time,” Nagy said. “What better way? . . . There’s no excuse now.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Players agreed in March to accept prorated shares of salaries during a shortened season as part of a deal that guaranteed them service time if no games are played.

Owners on Monday approved a proposal for an 82-game season. Concerned about losing money if games are played without fans, owners approved asking players to base their salaries on a 50-50 split of revenue. Players say that amounts to a salary cap and they will never agree to that framework.

The safety of elected officials during the pandemic is front and center now that a valet to President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary — whose husband is one of Trump’s closest advisers — have tested positive for the coronavirus.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker is working from his Gold Coast mansion after a member of his senior staff tested positive for COVID-19.

The infected staffer worked “down the hall” from the governor and attended daily meetings with Pritzker at the Thompson Center while following safety protocols, including wearing face masks, maintaining social distance and undergoing daily temperature checks, the governor said.

Across the street at City Hall, Lightfoot has taken similar precautions with employees in the mayor’s office.

“We have not had any cases amongst the senior staff. But like every other organization, we’ve had someone in the kind of larger mayor’s office … of over a hundred people,” the mayor said.

“The person was diagnosed, went into quarantine and isolation. We notified all of the people the person had come in contact with. This has been some weeks back. So we have a very specific protocol on how to handle these cases. We are doing temperature checks. And we are looking at other safety measures.”

Lightfoot said most of her staff has been working from home for weeks along with many other employees who normally work out of City Hall.

“We do have a small group that remains in the building. We’re being diligent about who comes in and who doesn’t. Most people are wearing masks. We’ve got hand-sanitizing products all over the office,” the mayor said.

“But we’re also looking at some additional measures, particularly as we start to think about the possibility of bringing staff back to City Hall. Those are ongoing conversations that we’re having.”

The mayor did not say how often she has been tested for the coronavirus or when she was tested last.

Lightfoot is frequently seen wearing a face mask that looks like the Chicago flag, with the words, “Stay Home. Save Lives.” Like the governor, she takes it off while speaking publicly.

“We’re not gonna send in the police to arrest parishioners. People are exercising their faith, and I understand that,” the mayor said.

“But it’s a mistake to gather in large congregate settings — particularly if you have an underlying medical condition [or] you are otherwise in a vulnerable population. That’s hopefully the dialogue that we’ll be able to have with the pastor.”

Lightfoot has not hesitated to play the heavy during the pandemic.

She shut down the lakefront, the Riverwalk and the 606 Trail when Chicagoans could not be trusted to avoid gathering in large groups and drove around the city breaking up those gatherings. She cut off citywide liquor sales at 9 p.m.

Why, then, wasn’t the service at the Elim Romanian Pentecostal Church shut down?

“Our plan has always been to educate people into compliance. If we can do that, we will do that. We don’t want to take more aggressive measures unless we’re forced to do that because people are defying it,” the mayor said.

“But we’re not gonna have a circumstance where people are blatantly ignoring the rules that have been put in place to help save peoples’ lives.”

The mayor said she had a “very pleasant conversation” with Cristian Ionescu, Elim Romanian’s senior pastor, on Monday and hopes to have a follow-up conversation soon.

Last week, Elim Romanian and Logos Baptist ministries in Niles asked for a temporary restraining order preventing them from facing criminal repercussions for hosting services while vowing to impose strict social distancing measures.

Speaking in his native Romanian, Cristian Ionescu, Elim Romanian’s senior pastor, told his flock the move to hold services is “not a rebellion for the sake of rebellion” and claimed the Constitution grants them the right to worship during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We feel that we are discriminated against,” Ionescu told the Chicago Sun-Times, noting large groups of people are allowed to shop at grocery and hardware stores. “We follow the same rules as other places that are also considered essential, and yet we cannot have more than 10 people in a service, which is ridiculous.”

On Sunday, Elim Romanian took considerable steps to adhere to the state’s social distancing and public safety guidelines: Masks, gloves and hand sanitizer were made available, temperature checks were conducted at the door, and capacity was limited to 120 worshippers, though the church’s main auditorium and overflow rooms can hold 1,300.

Roughly 70 people were in attendance, including the church leadership, band and choir.

The vast majority of congregants didn’t wear masks during the service. But almost everyone put one on before leaving. And when the service was winding down, Ionescu sternly directed his followers to stay 6 feet apart and warned against congregating outside.

“Why is this important? We are being watched,” he said. “We are being recorded.”

Last month, Lightfoot vowed to be “straightforward and very transparent” with Chicagoans if and when she concluded tax increases were needed to plug the giant hole in her 2020 budget caused by the stay-at-home shutdown of the city’s economy.

On Friday, the tough talk began.

“We’re looking at a range of potential revenue-generating options. Look, the reality is, I don’t think there’s any city budget across the country that is not gonna have to look at one-time measures to put yourself back on track,” the mayor said.

“We’d like to avoid those in this administration. But, the truth is, we’re probably gonna have to look at those as well given the magnitude of the challenge that we’re facing — not only to make sure that we’re steady for 2020 but looking to 2021 and beyond.”

Lightfoot said increasing property taxes is “always the last choice,” even though it is the most reliable source of revenue. But it is “particularly the last choice in this environment, when people are really, really suffering” and unemployment has risen to levels not seen since the Great Depression.

“The number of landlords that are worried about foreclosure. The number of renters that are worried about being able to make the rent. If we raise property taxes, that has a cascading effect on the ecosystem — on landlords and renters at a time when neither can afford it,” she said.

With property taxes off the table, where will Lightfoot turn for revenue?

She would only say, “The reality is that, when you have to have revenue, it’s going to impact someone — and probably someones plural. But we’re looking at efficiencies that we save internally first. I still believe that you can’t go out and talk to the taxpayers about sacrifice if you’re not making commonsense sacrifices within city government.”

For weeks after the stay-at-home shutdown, Lightfoot said Chicago was well-positioned to weather the storm of increased costs and declining revenues tied to the coronavirus pandemic without blowing a giant hole in her precariously balanced budget.

She repeatedly said “no one revenue stream is more than 13%” and that all of the “economically sensitive” revenues together total just 25%.

Her claims about city finances ignored the fact that when the stock market drops and city pension funds don’t meet their expected investment returns, Chicago taxpayers make up the difference.

The mayor even ridiculed former mayoral challenger Paul Vallas for writing an opinion column claiming Chicago was “facing a code-red fiscal crisis” and Lightfoot’s “claim that Chicago’s budget is in good shape strains credulity.”

In a stinging public put-down, Lightfoot referred to Vallas as “desperate to be relevant” during the crisis and said he “probably hasn’t touched a city budget, doesn’t know the nuances, in probably two decades.”

Vallas served as city revenue director, budget director and Chicago Public Schools CEO under former Mayor Richard M. Daley.

On April 7, the mayor changed her tune and acknowledged the possibility of a midyear budget fix.

On Friday, she again refused to project the size of Chicago’s budget shortfall, saying the situation was still “unbelievably fluid” and an initial estimate would end up too low and need to be revised upward at a time when laid-off Chicagoans are struggling to pay rent and put food on the table.

“A lot of it depends on when we reopen, who reopens, what the revenue stream is from the businesses that do reopen. This is not simple math. It’s very, very complicated and it’s fluid. We want to put something out that we can stand behind,” she said.

“I’m a cautious person. I want to make sure we understand the full magnitude of the challenge. Has there been an impact? Of course there has been. Has it been significant? Yes. What that looks like precisely, we still need to look at some other data that just hasn’t come in yet.”

Lightfoot said a “big, important, determining factor” in the need to raise local taxes will be what, if any, revenue replacement relief comes from Congress in the next round of stimulus money.

She noted the Federal Reserve has also “opened up potential borrowing for municipalities” like Chicago, and she is “still working with them to understand what that possibility would look like” while maintaining dialogue with Wall Street ratings agencies.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Today, more than six weeks after the primary, Manny’s is pretty much limited to carryout, curbside pick-up and delivery dining options and walk-in grocery business. And no one is even answering the phone at Cecina Grill.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s March 21 stay-at-home order put the brakes on much activity across Illinois – from bars and barber shops to baseball diamonds and beaches.

And as important as it all is to the politicians, hand-shaking, door-knocking and glad-handing for contributions are not deemed essential business.

Typically, campaigns begin shifting gears after the primary to prepare for the general election — candidates work rooms, attend fundraisers and meet with both would-be donors and potential supporters. Underdogs schedule regular news conferences in hopes of raising their profiles.

But as the state grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, many countywide candidates who are looking to the November general election are doing little campaigning and have reported little, if any, money coming in, according to Illinois Board of Elections filings.

For the county’s marquee race — Cook County state’s attorney — the pandemic has meant a shifting of resources and focus.

Hoping to topple incumbent Democrat Kim Foxx, Republican nominee Pat O’Brien said the coronavirus pandemic has made for a “less than typical fundraising” cycle now focused on Zoom or phone calls as a means for getting funding and support from would-be voters.

“It’s not easy when coronavirus has created economic uncertainty, but it’s not impossible,” the former Circuit Court judge said. “Obviously money is important to get the message out, but I think we’ll have the money to do that. All the money in the world can’t change what she’s already done and the opinion people have of her.”

Alex Sims, a senior adviser for Foxx’s re-election effort, said in a statement the campaign “acknowledges this challenging time and that individuals and families are facing new financial circumstances due to COVID-19.”

“Much of the Foxx campaign’s current efforts are going towards a ‘Good Neighbor’ program, offering wellness checks to our constituents, in partnership with Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky,” Sims said. “With a pivotal race ahead of her, the State’s Attorney is being cautious and thoughtful in her fundraising efforts as she pushes forward to November.”

Foxx’s campaign hasn’t reported any new campaign donations since the March primary. Four years ago, in the days immediately after the March 15 primary, Foxx reported nearly $75,000 in cash and in-kind contributions.

The bulk of that was a $40,000 gift from Foxx’s mentor and chair of the Cook County Democrats Toni Preckwinkle, who doubles as Cook County Board president.

The county party is also seeing its fundraising impacted by the pandemic.

Executive director Jacob Kaplan said the party is still “trying to figure out how to adapt to the new world we’re likely to be in for a while.”

Typically, Cook County Democrats hold a 500-person fundraiser in October, but no one knows if that will be held or how.

“There’s not a lot of answers at this point,” Kaplan said, adding that the party is exploring some options, including hosting the event virtually. “How do you book an event if you’re not sure if it’s possible?”

Despite the challenges, Kaplan says the party will “raise money one way or another.”

Campaigning will likely look different come fall — think more phone banking, mailings and virtual campaigning rather than door-to-door interactions or events.

Cook County Republican Chairman Sean Morrison pointed to Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden’s virtual rallies as a “symbol of the current political landscape across the country.”

“Right about now I would be having a spring fundraiser,” Morrison said. “It’s just tough. Nobody has the ability to go out and do anything. Our guidance to candidates has been pick up a phone, pick up the established donor list and make some phone calls.”

But given the state of the economy, Morrison said he doesn’t know “how loose the purse strings are going to be for down ballot races.”

Though Foxx will be able to raise funds from organized labor and special interests and largely rest on her name recognition, Morrison says O’Brien shouldn’t be discounted.

“He’ll get money,” Morrison said. “Even [coronavirus] aside, O’Brien has the best shot [to flip the State’s Attorney seat] in about a decade.”

As for Manny’s, owner-operator Dan Raskin said employees of the legendary deli are working “extra hard and differently to try to get business” during the pandemic.

Raskin hopes his family’s deli will be able to reopen ahead of the November primary — for both regular customers and politicians alike.

For now, candidates can “order their good luck corned beef sandwich, but they can’t eat it here.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Illinois election officials are crediting mail-in balloting and early voting with keeping the numbers up.

In Illinois, 28.36% of registered voters cast ballots in the March 17 primary, which is the third-lowest turnout for a presidential primary over the past 40 years, according to the official canvas released Friday.

But while the voter turnout was relatively low, it was comparable to recent presidential primaries.

Four of the previous six presidential primaries saw turnouts of less than 30 percent. And this year’s turnout topped the 2012 presidential primary, which had a 23.2% turnout and 2000’s nominating contest, which had 25.91%.

This year, 2,279,439 of the state’s 8,036,534 registered voters cast ballots in the March primary.

What saved voter turnout from bottoming out during the coronavirus pandemic for this year’s primary were options that allowed voters to avoid the precincts on Election Day, said Matt Dietrich, a spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections.

“It looks like we did have some offset from people who voted early and voted by mail,” Dietrich said.

Early numbers show vote-by-mail ballots increased from the previous primary election — 10% of total ballots cast this year, compared to 3% in the 2016 primary, according to the board’s unofficial numbers.

Early voting was also up, Dietrich said, with about 636,000 people opting to vote early, compared to 520,000 in 2016, according to unofficial numbers.

The statewide turnout was also boosted by Chicago, where election officials have already released figures showing a city turnout of 37.78% — also crediting early and mail-in voting with boosting the final numbers.

The statewide canvas released Friday included the final results for contests up and down the ballot.

Among the Democratic presidential contenders, former Vice President Joe Biden ran away with the primary, winning 58.94% of the vote, compared to the nearest contender, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who nabbed 36.18%.

In the contentious 3rd Congressional District Democratic primary, challenger Marie Newman won 47.26% of the vote, beating incumbent eight-term Rep. Dan Lipinski, who won 44.72%.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

As many as ten contenders are hoping to present their credentials to the eight-member panel of Democratic Party leaders planning to meet in Berwyn on Wednesday to make the decision.

Organizers did not respond to requests for comment about their rationale for holding the meeting while the state is under Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order.

But Cook County Clerk Karen Yarbrough, who doubles as Democratic committeeperson for Proviso Township, said candidates seeking the appointment will come before the committee one by one and the party leaders will be six feet apart.

Earlier in the day, the entire 80-member Cook County Democratic Party is planning to hold its convention to elect party officers online rather than in person.

It’s been a little over five weeks since Tobolski announced he was giving up his Cook County commissioner seat, and in that time the field of would-be successors has swelled, inching closer to the size of the entire 17-member County Board itself.

That could complicate the work of the committee that plans to make the appointment Wednesday at a special meeting of Democratic leaders.

Since Tobolski announced his resignation March 6, the field of potential replacements has ballooned from four, to six and now to possibly as many as 10 candidates, said Yarbrough, who is on the committee to pick Tobolski’s replacement in her role as Democratic Proviso Township committeeperson.

“It seems like everybody involved has someone [from their area] who’s interested in this seat,” Yarbrough said.

Including Yarbrough.

The clerk and longtime committeeperson said she was waiting to connect with a candidate from her area who works for the Cook County state’s attorney’s office.

In addition to Yarbrough, the committee to pick Tobolski’s replacement includes Ald. Ed Burke (14th); Berwyn Mayor Robert Lovero, who has the largest weighted vote; Blanca Vargas of Cicero; Barrett Pederson of Leyden Township; Bridgeview Mayor and state Sen. Steven Landek of Lyons Township; state Rep. Michael Zalewski of Riverside Township, and Vincent Cainkar of Stickney Township.

The eight-member group, all members of the Cook County Democratic Party, are scheduled to meet Wednesday at 7 p.m. at the Italian-American Civic Organization of Berwyn. To be appointed, the candidate will need the weighted equivalent of 27,162 votes out of a possible 54,322.

Among the names of people said to be eyeing the position are Cicero realtor Eduardo Garcia, who founded Realty of Chicago in Berwyn; Victor Burgos, who works as an operating engineer in the county’s Department of Facilities Management; Mike Porfirio, the clerk of Lyons Township, and Frank Aguilar, a former Republican state representative elected to represent Cicero and Berwyn.

Burgos and Aguilar didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Porfirio pointed to his background and government experience in Lyons, Bridgeview and Summit to explain why he’d be “an effective commissioner.”

“I know the area well, and I think I would be able to represent the people very effectively,” Porfirio said. “I have a good pulse of what’s going on, and my experience would help me be a good public servant and steward to people.”

When asked about the job Tobolski did, Porfirio said the former commissioner was “visible” in the community but, with the cloud of a federal investigation looming over him, people want someone to “restore their faith and trust in government and public servants and I think we owe that to people — we owe it to people to be morally and ethically responsible.”

On March 6, Tobolski, who was first elected in 2010, resigned from both the County Board and his position as McCook village president effective March 31, according to the letters obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times.

That move was sparked by the September search of Tobolski’s McCook Village Hall offices, although he gave no reason given for either of the resignations.

That raid was part of a suburban squeeze that came days after federal agents raided the home and offices of former Democratic state Sen. Martin Sandoval. A source told the Chicago Sun-Times the raids were related.

After the raid, the former commissioner missed a string of County Board and Forest Preserve meetings — he blamed health issues for missing those meetings and said at a December Forest Preserve meeting that he was still under a doctor’s care but “... it’s my picking or choosing as to how I feel, and I’m back today.”

Pat Doherty, Tobolski’s chief of staff, was indicted in February on three bribery charges.

For Garcia, who is also vying for the appointment, the opportunity is one that could help balance the scales of diversity on the board. Since the county is more than 30% Hispanic, at least four Latinos should hold seats on the board, Garcia said.

He also hopes to educate people in the community about what a commissioner does and to bring resources to all parts of the district.

“I’m not going to be a part-time commissioner — anything I’ve done in my life, I’ve given it 150%,” Garcia said. “We need someone at the table in Cook County to voice our concerns.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Revall Burke, 60, a city parking enforcement aide who lived in the 7600 block of South Morgan, died April 1.

On March 17, Burke was assigned to the polling place at Zion Hill Missionary Baptist Church, 1460 W. 78th St.

Burke was the first city employee known to have died from the coronavirus, but his name was not made public when Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced the death on April 1.

His role as a polling place worker in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood was first reported Monday by Patch.com.

The news reignited the debate about whether Illinois should have proceeded with the primary election after the coronavirus outbreak had been identified as a global pandemic.

At his daily news briefing, Gov. J.B. Pritzker again defended the decision to go forward with the election, saying he had no legal authority under the Illinois Constitution to do otherwise.

“So, I couldn’t shut it down,” Pritzker said, noting he had instead encouraged voters to vote early and vote by mail.

“We were encouraging people not to go to the polls if they could avoid going to the polls, and indeed I think that’s exactly the same, that we need to do even more so when we get to the general election,” the governor said.

He also pointed out the election was held four days before he issued a stay-at-home order, making Illinois the second state in the nation to take that extreme step.

Pritzker’s administration announced Monday that an additional 1,173 cases of COVID-19 have been identified in Illinois along with 74 more deaths. That brings the statewide total to 22,025 cases and 794 deaths.

Jim Allen, spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners, said the board is sending letters to all voters and other election workers who may have come in contact with Burke at the polling place to inform them they may have been exposed.

Allen said it is the fourth letter sent from the board in the aftermath of the election warning of specific instances of possible COVID exposure because of a known confirmed case of someone who either worked or voted at a polling place.

The other letters involved the following polling places: Andrew Jackson Language Academy, 1340 W. Harrison, in the 28th Ward; Montclare Senior Residences, 1200 E. 78th St. in the 8th Ward; and William Dever School, 3436 N. Osceola, which hosted precincts from both the 29th and 38th Wards.

Matt Dietrich, a spokesman for the State Board of Elections, said this is the first report in Illinois of an election worker dying from the coronavirus.

According to the Cook County Medical Examiner’s report of COVID-19 victims, Burke suffered from diabetes and hypertensive arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Ald. David Moore (17th) said Burke’s family had asked him to not discuss his death.

Previously, the alderman posted photos of Burke on his Facebook page and described him as a “committed” 17th Ward precinct captain and 15-year city employee.

The alderman noted Burke wrote on his own Facebook introduction: “Life is too short stay Happy. I love being with family and friends. Bowling, shooting pool, road trip.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

But the queen’s address does have lessons for us Yanks, and particularly for Joe Biden. Part of what made the queen’s speech affecting was its theme of unity. She didn’t speak to the people so much as for the people.

She thanked, first of all, the health care workers and other essential employees who “selflessly continue their day-to-day duties outside the home in support of us all.” Next, she extended her thoughts to those remaining in their homes and caring for loved ones. “Together we are tackling this disease, and I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it.”

In a nod to Winston Churchill’s iconic “finest hour” speech, she offered a tribute to the nation’s character:

“I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge. And those who come after us will say the Britons of this generation were as strong as any. That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humored resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterize this country. The pride in who we are is not a part of our past, it defines our present and our future.”

We’ve heard that at stressful times, people want a strong leader, and that this accounts for the rally-around-the-flag effect so evident in opinion polls worldwide. Even Donald Trump has benefited, at least a little, from this reaction. But that isn’t the whole story.

Trying times also bring out people’s altruism and longing for unity. In my own circle, among friends, relatives and the neighborhood Listserv, offers of help, volunteering and contributions have overflowed. Neighbors volunteer to shop for elderly residents. Teenagers offer to help younger kids with homework via Zoom.

One person posted that she cannot cut her lawn because she hurt her foot. Another responded immediately, “I would be elated to mow your lawn since that’s what I do for work and I’ve got nothing better to do.”

Companies large and small have stepped up to donate supplies to health care workers, churches and others are caring for children whose parents are essential workers. Blood collection centers are crowded with donors. The list is nearly endless.

We’ve focused so much in recent years on the primitive side of our natures — the part that responds to tribalism and hatred of “out” groups. But while those traits are real enough, we didn’t achieve great civilizations by suspicion alone. Cooperation and, in Queen Elizabeth’s phrase, “fellow feeling,” is also part of our nature. Without cooperation, we’d still be wandering the savannah in groups of 15 or 20 with spears in one hand and babies on our backs.

Humans are cooperative creatures — even, at times, selfless ones. In wartime, men throw themselves on grenades to save others. In this time of plague, doctors and nurses willingly put their own lives at risk to save people they don’t even know.

Americans are already behaving in cooperative and unifying ways. What they lack is a voice. President Donald Trump is utterly incapable of sounding those notes. When he attempts it, as, for example, when an aide draws up some uplifting rhetoric, he seems to be sounding out the words as if reading another language. He is far more comfortable searching out enemies — the media, his predecessor, the “deep state,” underappreciative governors, General Motors and so forth.

Joe Biden, by contrast, is well-suited to the unifier role. His strength is a sympathetic understanding of others’ pain. His instincts are toward conciliation and cooperation, to the point that Democratic partisans were sometimes dismayed when, earlier in this cycle, he reminisced fondly about “getting things done” with Republicans.

Just now, in the midst of the crisis, Biden lacks an opportunity to voice a unifying message. But that time will come soon. He should seize it. It comes naturally to him. It would remind us of our better angels, and the country is yearning for it.

Little did she know she would be called upon to lead Chicago through the public health crisis of a lifetime, one that would force her to close the entire lakefront and all of its parks and beaches.

On Thursday, Lightfoot reflected on her one-year anniversary with seldom-seen emotion on the day that Chicago lost its first police officer to the coronavirus.

“This isn’t the day that I thought it was going to be and thinking about April 2. But I’m grateful every day that the good Lord wakes me up and gives me the opportunity to serve the city,” the mayor said.

“It’s been the honor of my lifetime. When the voters of this city gave me such a resounding victory, winning all 50 wards by such a large margin, I was incredibly humbled and I remain so. We’ve been through a lot in this last year — more than, I think, anyone would have expected or anticipated.”

Until the coronavirus pandemic brought everyday life in Chicago to a screeching halt, Lightfoot’s biggest concern was her war on poverty and her plan to target 10 inner-city neighborhoods for an unprecedented $250 million city investment and $500 million more from other government agencies.

She was being pressured from the left to deliver civilian police review and more money for the homeless and affordable housing. She was also trying to tamp down a spike in homicides and shootings and choose a permanent replacement for fired Police Supt. Eddie Johnson.

Now, COVID-19 occupies nearly every waking moment. Every day there are more deaths. Even more people test positive. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. Only a “pinprick,” as she put it.

Even so, Lightfoot said she is grateful for the support she continues to receive from total strangers who give her the thumbs-up—in spite of the policing role she never wanted to play that has fueled a hysterical string of memes.

“In this really unprecedented time, I’m reminded every day of how amazing the people in this city are. People are stepping up and really pushing past their comfort levels to be of service to total strangers in this time of need,” she said.

“I’m following their example and encouraging myself, my team and the entire city to really embrace this moment — as horrific at times as it feels — because the only way we get to the other side of this is by being lock-step together and knowing that our fate is wrapped up in each other. When the light at the end of the tunnel comes, it’s gonna be because of the sacrifices each of us have made in service of the larger good.”

Lightfoot was asked how she is holding up personally. She choked back tears, having just talked to and consoled the dead officer’s widow.

“In this moment, I’m very sad. … Those are very hard conversations to have. ... Having been through death and grief myself, these moments are so surreal and they’re so hard. I’m feeling that for that family,” the mayor said.

In an emailed message to her campaign supporters, Lightfoot marked the anniversary by saying it “helps to remember all the things that make our city great and the sacrifices we are making today to return to that reality.”

She added: “I’m looking forward to catching a Sox game, grabbing a pint at my favorite pub, listening to live music in person, shaking hands with worshipers at Sunday services and hugging a small child again — all without hesitation.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Illinois House Majority Leader Greg Harris, D-Chicago, and state Sen. Elgie Sims, D-Chicago, chairs of the Joint Commission on Ethics and Lobbying Reform, said Tuesday that the pandemic has forced them to miss a deadline in their efforts.

The commission was required to release a report by Tuesday with recommendations on how to end entrenched corruption in Illinois, but as the COVID-19 crisis has temporarily shut down sessions of the General Assembly, it has also stymied the work of the commission.

“We have completed our meetings, heard from stakeholders and are working through the proposals that have been put before us,” the two Chicago Democrats said in a joint statement. “However, due to the ongoing crisis, more time will be necessary to complete our work.”

The commission, established by the Legislature in November, is tasked with proposing ways to reform state government in the wake of scandals that have rocked state, county and municipal government. Harris and Sims said they still hope to pass ethics reform legislation in the spring legislative session, which is scheduled to adjourn May 31. But since lawmakers have not met since March 5 – and Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday extended the state’s stay-at-home order until April 30 — that could become increasingly difficult.

Before the pandemic altered the landscape, Pritzker declared that ending corruption was a priority. In his State of the State speech in January, the governor said the state must “root out the purveyors of greed and corruption — in both parties — whose presence infects the bloodstream of government.”

A wide-ranging federal investigation targeting state lawmakers and other politicians prompted the latest push.

In September, federal officials raided the offices of state Sen. Martin Sandoval. The Southwest Side Democrat pleaded guilty to corruption charges in January.

In October, state Rep. Luis Arroyo was charged with bribery. The former Northwest Side Democratic legislator’s case is still ongoing. Earlier last year, state Sen. Tom Cullerton, D-Villa Park, was indicted in August for allegedly embezzling money from the Teamsters.

While Republican lawmakers wanted to tackle corruption in the fall veto session last November, Democrats opted to form the commission to study the issue first and to release a report on what reforms are needed.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The donation is made possible through the ASJ and its subsidiary project “Time Done,” which aims to knock down legal barriers that previously incarcerated people often face such as access to housing, education and employment.

As of this week, seven detainees of the jail have died after testing positive for COVID-19, according to the Cook County Sheriff’s office. In addition, 236 detainees have tested positive for the virus, with six receiving treatment at hospitals. Another 291 detainees are no longer considered positive for COVID and are being monitored at the jail’s recovery facility, the sheriff’s office said.

Two corrections officers and a court deputy at the facility died earlier this week.

“The conditions in jails and prisons are ripe for spreading coronavirus within them and into communities,” said Robert Rooks, co-founder and CEO of Alliance for Safety and Justice, in a statement. “There have been important efforts to reduce the population at Cook County Jail, yet we wanted to provide support to protect people inside of the facility while also recognizing there is more to be done. There are ways to safely reduce incarceration that are critical to prevent any further spread of COVID-19.”

G Herbo isn’t the only Chicago hip-hop luminary who’s giving back to a community in a time of need.

Earlier this week, activist and rapper Common called attention to how the pandemic poses a health risk to millions of incarcerated people in the U.S. via his criminal justice reform organization Imagine Justice in a campaign dubbed #WeMatterToo.

That will change soon. The Cleveland museum plans to reopen as soon as June 15, Rock Hall President and CEO Greg Harris told USA TODAY on Wednesday.

Harris said the museum would create a safe environment, but not a sterile one.

“We need to keep the DNA of rock and roll,” he said.

Nearly 600,000 visitors annually pass through the doors of the museum, which opened in September 1995. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, it’s been closed since March 14.

When the museum reopens, the visitor experience will be different. Harris said all tickets will be digital, and visitors will register for a time slot to enter the museum.

At the entrance, visitors will go to a tented area where nurses will take their temperature. Visitors will be scanned in to enter, and will be required to wear face coverings.

Employees will wear masks, as well. Hand sanitizer will be available, and museum staff will wipe down surfaces frequently. All touch screens will be covered, and interactive exhibits, such as one where visitors can play musical instruments, will remain closed.

Visitor traffic through the museum will move in one direction. The cafe and gift shop will be open following state guidelines for social distancing.

“We want to provide an environment that is safe as possible,” Harris said.

Harris said an infectious disease specialist from the world-renowned Cleveland Clinic will be on site.

The goal is to operate the museum at about 50% capacity, Harris said. The museum will reopen with shorter hours — 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. — to allow for extra cleaning and disinfecting. Certain hours will be reserved for at-risk populations, including seniors and people with chronic conditions.

Harris said the facility is keeping a close eye on museums in the region and nationwide, and he’s been in contact with Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine.

“We’re going to be very measured as we start,” Harris said.

While digital tickets are not currently available to purchase, Harris said he expects to announce when they’ll go on sale by June 1.

Harris said he hopes to bring back food trucks and beer gardens to the museum’s plaza. Live music will resume, though initially with soloists instead of bands.

There will also be a day reserved just for medical professionals and emergency personnel who have been on the front lines of the coronavirus response.

Some of the museum’s employees will continue to work remotely, and others who were furloughed will be called back as they’re needed. Harris said he continued to pay for health insurance for the furloughed employees.

As for the 2020 Hall of Fame induction ceremony, rescheduled for Nov. 7, Harris said no determination has been made about how the event will proceed.

“We’re holding the date,” he said.

The Doobie Brothers, Whitney Houston, Nine Inch Nails, Depeche Mode, The Notorious B.I.G. and T. Rex are among this year’s inductees.

A lot will depend on how large-attendance gatherings such as sports events and concerts will be handled in the coming months, Harris said.

Harris calls the Rock Hall “the most powerful museum in the entire world” because visitors come to it with a reservoir of memories connected to what’s in the building.

That could be a first love, a breakup or a memorable concert.

“It all comes out through the triggers in our museum,” he said. “Our goal is to deliver that same experience when we’re adhering to all these health and safety protocols.”

On Monday, the Canadian singer shared a video to Instagram of him playing guitar and singing “Cuts Like a Knife” accompanied with a caption sarcastically thanking the “bat eating, wet market animal selling, virus making greedy (expletives)” for starting the pandemic.

“The whole world is now on hold, not to mention the thousands that have suffered or died from this virus. My message to them other than ‘thanks a (expletive) lot’ is go vegan,” Adams wrote. “To all the people missing out on our shows, I wish I could be there more than you know. It’s been great hanging out in isolation with my children and family, but I miss my other family, my band, my crew and my fans.”

The note prompted social media outcry, with some posters accusing Adams of racism. On Tuesday, Adams issued a statement on Instagram in the same fashion: He shared a video singing “Into the Fire,” alongside a caption apologizing for his previous post.

“Apologies to any and all that took offence to my posting yesterday. No excuse, I just wanted to have a rant about the horrible animal cruelty in these wet-markets being the possible source of the virus, and promote veganism,” Adams wrote. “I have love for all people and my thoughts are with everyone dealing with this pandemic around the world.”

Adams isn’t the first classic rocker to call out wet markets in response to the coronavirus and call for veganism.

Speaking with NME in an interview published in April, Queen’s Brian May said he thinks a vegan diet would be better for people’s overall health.

“If you want to get deep into it, I think we should be looking again at whether we should be eating animals,” Queen’s co-founder said. “That’s a central issue here, this pandemic seemed to come from people eating animals and it’s becoming more well known that eating animals is not the greatest thing for our health.”

The consensus among researchers studying the spread of the virus pinpoints COVID-19’s likely origin to a “wet market” in Wuhan, China, where live and dead creatures including bats are sold as food and for alleged medicinal purposes. Though experts have not ruled out the possibility that the pathogen could have been brought to the market by an already infected person, there is no evidence to suggest COVID-19 originated outside the country.

Share All sharing options for: She left Illinois to be a cruise ship singer, got stuck at sea nearly 2 months by COVID-19

For the first 22 years of her life, Julia Lindsey had never seen the sea.

But for two months, that’s all she saw — day after day after day — from her cabin aboard the Celebrity Infinity cruise ship, stuck onboard because of coronavirus concerns, first outside Miami, then the Bahamas.

“I’m very, very frustrated,” Lindsey, 24, a singer working on the ship who grew up in Poplar Grove, about 75 miles northwest of downtown Chicago, said this past week.

She finally was able to disembark Saturday at the port of Miami.

“Yay, I’m free!” she posted on Facebook Live from a bus taking her back to Illinois. “Fifty-seven days on board, and I am off the ship and I am headed home!”

Maybe you heard in March that people were stranded on cruise ships at American ports because of safety worries tied to COVID-19. Though many were allowed to leave in the following weeks, Lindsey, till Saturday, was one of an estimated 100,000 crew members still stuck on cruise ships in or near American waters by the pandemic.

They’d been caught in a dispute between cruise lines and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over the cruise companies’ refusal to accept responsibility for making sure the disembarkation process followed CDC guidelines.

Michael Bayley, chief executive officer of Royal Caribbean International, which owns the Celebrity Infinity, told employees the company finally agreed, allowing its workers to go home.

Lindsey had had her bags packed three times, only to be told earlier plans to let the crew disembark fell through.

She took the cruise job because “I’ve only ever wanted to perform.” And she saw this as a way to her dream.

She started work for the cruise line after graduating in 2018 in musical theater from Decatur’s Millikin University. She’d never been outside the United States before. She auditioned in New York after sending a one-minute video singing Heart’s “Barracuda.”

“Half an hour after I left the callback, I had a contract in my email,” she said. “It was very, very exciting.”

She’s gotten to travel to Asia, Europe and beyond — a big change for a young woman whose summers were spent visiting relatives on a farm in Nebraska.

Even for Lindsey, one of the stars of the show, this wasn’t quite Broadway, her ultimate goal.

“The audience members can come in as late as they want,” she said. “They eat, they drink through it, they’ll sleep. They’ll get up in the middle of it and leave.”

But the pay was good, so she could save to move to New York.

“I didn’t think that this was going to be that big of a deal,” Lindsey said of the pandemic, which crew members first heard of in early March.

On March 14, a day after her last cruise ended and passengers disembarked in Miami, she and other employees were told, even though no one had tested positive, they’d have to wait out two weeks of isolation.

“We had free rein of the ship,” Lindsey said. “We were able to use all the pools. We were putting on shows for the crew. We were just hanging out for a long time, just by ourselves, in the middle of the ocean.”

Nine days later, a crew member tested positive. Days later, everything changed. For nearly 2 ½ half weeks, employees were confined to their cabins 24 hours a day, with water and food left at their doors.

“I was going absolutely crazy,” said Lindsey, who shared a cabin with her boyfriend.

Her parents, who live in Belvidere, worried like crazy about her.

“You’re not being given any good information about the when and the how you’ll get out of it — that’s very troubling,” Lisa Whitcomb, her mother, said days before her daughter finally got off the ship.

Crew members eventually were allowed out of their cabins — for three hours a day — to eat in a “big dining hall.” On April 30, the restrictions were loosened more: They could leave their cabins as long as they wear masks and practice social distancing.

Listening to music, strolling on the deck, talking with her family and having her boyfriend, who’s the cruise ship’s music director, with her kept her sane.

“We’ve gotten to know each other very well,” she said. “At the end of every fight, I’ll say: ‘You have to realize I would never spend 33 days alone in a room with anybody. It’s not personal.’ ”

After all of this, Lindsey says: “I’m going to stay away from the water for a long time. I would never even come on a ship as a guest.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The Grant Park Music Festival on Monday announced the cancellation of its 2020 season, originally set for June 10-Aug. 15 at the Pritzker Pavilion in Millennium Park and other locations across the Chicago area. More than 300,000 people attend the festival each year.

The free classical music festival, featuring the Grant Park Orchestra, under the direction of artistic director and principal conductor Carlos Kalmar, and the Grant Park Chorus, under the direction of Christopher Bell, has been a summertime tradition since 1935. Attracting world-renowned musicians and singers from across the country and around the world, the festival has continuously provided a diverse repertoire of classical music favorites and world premieres. In addition, the festival has been home to classic movie nights (featuring the orchestra providing live accompaniment to screenings of some of Hollywood’s greatest musicals) and Broadway show celebrations.

Among the festival’s canceled events are the annual Independence Day Salute extravaganza, all neighborhood parks programming, as well as master classes and open rehearsals.

“We’re still working to calculate the losses we will experience as a result of a summer without the Grant Park Music Festival,” said festival president and CEO Paul Winberg in statement. ”We hope our longstanding friends and donors will continue to maintain their support during this difficult time, helping the festival to return next summer stronger and more vibrant than ever.”

The move is the latest large-event casualty of the coronavirus pandemic, joining the cancellation of Chicago’s blues and gospel festivals, announced last week.

“There just is no way that we could make this [happen],” said Ravinia president and CEO Welz Kauffman about Friday’s announcement. “We’ve been wracking our brains trying to figure out how to make the social distancing work and ensure the safety of everyone who comes here — the kids and families, the artists, staff and our neighbors. There was just no way to do it. ... And many artists have already canceled their 2020 tours.”

The season shut-down is the first one since the Great Depression forced the now 116-year-old festival to close its doors from 1932 to 1935.

Ravinia’s 60 full-time staff are being redeployed from their usual duties to handling the cancellation, upcoming developments and next year’s festival plans. “We decided that furloughing was not the way to go,” Kauffman said. Nearly 600 seasonal workers needed each year for the festival will not be hired.

Kauffman said the cancellation was a unanimous and heartbreaking decision by the festivals’ board of directors.

“How was anyone even going to get here?,” Kauffman said. “Nobody’s going to get on a Metra train and then stand in lines to get bags checked and tickets taken one at a time.” Nearly 60,000 people ride Metra to the festival’s front gate each year. Overall, more than 500,000 people attend the festival annually.

This season’s lineup was announced March 12 for shows June 12-Sept. 16. Jill Scott, Patti LaBelle, Ms. Lauryn Hill, Tony Bennett, John Legend and Rodrigo y Gabriela were among the acts that had been booked, in addition to a full summer residency by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under the baton of the festival’s newly appointed chief conductor and curator Marin Alsop.

In addition, Ravinia’s famed Steans Music Institute, the summerlong teaching/performance conservatory for young artists, is also shuttered for the year. Plans for online music and educational programming are in the robust discussion stages, Kauffman said.

2020 also marks Kauffman’s final season at the helm of the festival after 20 years, and though he would not comment about his departure, he offered enthusiastic support for the 2021 season.

“I’m just going to continue to work through the particular aspects of the 2020 [season] and then the focus will shift to 2021,” Kauffman said. “I hope I’m able to leave my successor or successors something they can feel good about, and that does mean keeping as much in place from this summer for next summer. We just don’t know yet. In many ways it’s easier to just move someone from one year to another than it is to start fresh. And this season is one we and our audiences were very excited about.”

To date, Kauffman said at least a dozen artists have already requested rescheduled dates for 2021, though he would not elaborate. “We’re still working through all of this.”

Ticketholders can get refunds or vouchers for future performances by calling the box office at (847) 266-5100. Donors are being contacted directly. Patrons can also consider donating their tickets back to Ravinia to help fund outreach programs.

Mexico’s culture secretary confirmed the singer’s death, but the Social Security Institute would not comment on local media reports saying he died Thursday of complications from COVID-19. A note on Chavez’s personal twitter account, signed by his staff, said he had been hospitalized Wednesday with symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus.

Chávez was best known for folk-style songs lampooning Mexico’s corrupt political elite. One such song was “La Casita” (“The Little House”), which described an imaginary politician’s mansion.

Culture Secretary Alejandra Frausto wrote in her Twitter account: “Thank you, Oscar Chávez, your life was journey worthy of you! My deepest sympathy to your relatives, friends and companions in struggle and song.”

Interior Secretary Olga Sánchez wrote: “I have learned to my deep regret that a voice of the struggle has been silenced. My deepest sympathy to the family of Oscar Chávez.”

Chávez sang ballads since the 1960s and played in public as recently as 2019.

Mexico has reported 19,224 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,859 deaths.

On Thursday, Miguel Angel Osorio Chong, a former interior secretary and current senator for the old ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, wrote in his Twitter account that he had tested positive for coronavirus and would self-isolate at home.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

He was 52.

Sneed’s publicist Bill Carpenter said the singer died early Monday at a hospital in Jacksonville, Florida. Sneed earned a Grammy nomination for his work on the Youth For Christ’s 1999 album “Higher.”

Sneed traveled throughout the United States early in his career to sing the gospel with the Georgia Mass Choir. He arranged music on their albums and appeared with the choir in the 1996 film “The Preacher’s Wife,” starring Whitney Houston and Denzel Washington.

Sneed helped form Youth For Christ, which was comprised of members between the ages of 12 and 18 from the Georgia Mass Choir. He served as a producer on Youth For Christ’s “The Struggle Is Over,” which landed at No. 1 on Billboard’s gospel songs chart in 2006.

As a solo artist, Sneed released seven albums and had several hit songs within the gospel realm including “Work It Out” and “My Heart Says Yes,” which both peaked at No. 2 on Billboard’s gospel chart. He’s also known for the upbeat “Hallelujah.”

Sneed and his wife, Emily, started their own record label Emtro, which is a blend of their first names. Their label became a success with a roster of artists from Alvin Darling & Celebration and Rev. Rudolph McKissick.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

He had a May 3 gig at City Winery lined up where he planned on jamming with some of Chicago’s blues luminaries.

The coronavirus pandemic has all but wiped that out — indefinitely.

And last week, the city canceled the 37th annual Chicago Blues Fest, which was scheduled for June 5-7 — an announcement that sounded like a death knell to many of the city’s blues artists.

“I’m grateful to be turning 50, but I’m so sad about me not being able to ring it in like it was planned,” said Brooks. “Man, this is horrible. … And we definitely got the blues right now; everybody in the world got the blues right now.”

Brooks, the son of blues legend Lonnie Brooks, had a big summer of touring ahead. Like other Chicago area artists in the genre, he wants to keep the blues alive. Over the years, he’s performed with the likes of Buddy Guy, Koko Taylor, Bo Diddley, Taj Mahal and Otis Clay.

“Every single day, I’m getting a cancellation and it’s very disheartening,” said Brooks. “This is my main source of income, which is live touring.

“But for the most part, I have no income coming in. … So, as a musician, I’m definitely sick and I’m in a boat that is sinking.”

Blues guitarist Joanna Connor, a full-time musician for almost four decades, has done a series of online concerts and Q&A sessions since the pandemic took all of her gigs away.

“It’s been a good life but it’s not like I had piles of money put away; I was kind of living gig to gig,” said Connor. “I just made a record and that’s been put on hold, and so everything’s kind of suspended at this point, you know.

“I’m getting like 12,000 views in a few days, so I think it’s speaking to people who get the realness of the music because we’re in a situation.”

Gary, Indiana, blues singer and guitarist Donald Kinsey, an original member of The Wailers — reggae singer Bob Marley’s band — says blues musicians will continue to roll with the punches because the genre often documents when people are down on their luck.

“One thing for sure, there’s gonna be a lot of songs to come from this,” said Kinsey. “That’s what we do with songwriters and musicians and so, you know, we look forward to being able to get back out and do what we do: traveling and move people’s spirits.”

Some of the venues where many of the city’s blues artists plied their trade continue to do fundraisers. A GoFundMe account for Kingston Mines says the famed Lincoln Park club might close for good without more cash, while Logan Square’s Rosa’s Lounge is providing a platform for artists to perform online videos and solicit donations through its Facebook fan page.

Blues Fest usually brings a bump in revenue — but not this summer.

“The only revenue I can generate is when you [patrons] come to us; it’s 100 percent of our revenue, “ said Tony Mangiullo, Rosa’s owner, describing the business he’s lost since Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s shelter-in-place order went into effect. “After this [COVID-19 pandemic], it’s not going to be the same. ... We are the ones who’s gonna take the risk; we are used to that. And we are the ones who have to be creative. ... People will be hesitant.”

Other venues have made the pivot to keep their cash flow going by opening up their spaces to community organizations who need areas to operate.

The Quarry, a South Shore-based venue that hosts live blues and jazz sets, has allowed Sweet Potato Patch, an organization that delivers healthy meals to Chicagoans who live in food deserts, to prepare meals at the venue while allowing community members to come in to receive equipment such as N95 face masks amid the pandemic.

Yvette Moyo, The Quarry’s CEO, says the venue wants to hand out meals for local blues artists who lost their ability to earn due to the pandemic.

“While we’re not doing entertainment and while we worry a lot about artists, we are making good use of our venue,” said Moyo. “They had a hustle lifestyle; it would be great if we could provide free meals to the artists that we were supporting in the past.”

Bruce Iglauer, president and founder of Alligator Records, which includes Lil’ Ed & The Blues Imperials, Christone “Kingfish” Ingram and Shemekia Copeland among the artists on its roster, has seen how the pandemic continues to crush gig workers like his artists.

“Until they either have a vaccine or they know that people become immune after having the illness, I don’t see how we’re going to be able to return to anything like the old normal,” said Iglauer. “So I’m concerned about the future for performing — not just the immediate future, but the long-term future.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The event promoter, which announced the “Ticket Relief” initiative last week, posted the update on its website and social media accounts Friday.

The policy goes into effect May 1, when Live Nation begins sending out notification emails updating customers on the the status of thousands of shows affected by stay-at-home orders and bans on large gatherings issued over the last two months.

“If 60 days has passed since a show was postponed and no rescheduled dates have been announced, the 30-day window for refunds will open at that time,” Live Nation added on its “Ticket Relief” page.

In the case of rescheduled shows at venues operated by Live Nation, customers will have 30 days to request a refund or apply it as 150% credit towards future events once the new date is announced. (The offer is not valid for special events, third party rentals or festivals.)

“When you choose this option, Live Nation will also donate tickets to healthcare workers to share the gift of live with those working on the front line through our Hero Nation program,” the company said. “We will donate one ticket for every ticket you originally purchased.

For customers who don’t request a refund within that window, their existing tickets will automatically be valid for the new date. Alternately, customers can opt to donate their tickets for the rescheduled show to front-line workers.

COVID-19 concerns could create a $9 billion loss for the concert industry, The LA Times reported earlier this month.

Cancellations and postponements have been piling up as the pandemic has played out. The latest example: pop megastar Taylor Swift, who announced last week that she was calling off her “Lover Fest” stadium tour and other live appearances for the rest of 2020. Her U.S. dates will be rescheduled for next year. Those unable to attend rescheduled U.S. dates can seek a refund “subject to Ticketmaster terms” beginning May 1.

In addition, Madonna has canceled show dates and Pearl Jam and The Zac Brown Band have postponed entire tours.

In the case of postponed arena and stadium shows, event promoters likely won’t have a clear picture of when they can reschedule concerts until the NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball decide how and when to restart their seasons and resume their game schedules for those venues. The NBA got that process rolling Saturday, when it announced that teams can reopen practice facilities in cities where stay-at-home orders have been eased.

The Chosen Few Picnic & House Music Festival, which generally brings in 40,000 attendees annually, was scheduled for July 4 in the South Side’s Jackson Park neighborhood, has been postponed, according to an official announcement Friday.

In its place, a virtual event scheduled for the same date, will feature a free, live-streamed performances and DJ sets from the Chosen Few DJs, and more.

“The decision to transition our beloved ‘Woodstock of House Music’ from a mass in-person gathering to a virtual one this year was not an easy one,” said picnic officials in a statement. “Like many of you, we want nothing more than to get together with our fellow house music lovers in person, just as we have done for the past 29 Julys. However, given the extraordinary time we are in, and the critical health dangers associated with large gatherings, we know this is the safest course of action for our picnic attendees, guest performers, vendors, and neighbors.”

Tickets purchased for the 2020 festival will be honored at the 2021 event. Ticket holders also have the option to submit a request for a refund at https://explore.seetickets.us/refund-form-chosen-few-2020/. Refund requests must be made by 11:59 p.m. on May 22, 2020.

Details about this year’s virtual event on July 4 will be announced in the coming weeks.

In addition, for the first time in the festival’s history, organizers are asking the public for online contributions to help support COVID-19 charitable efforts. Details about making the donations will also be announced in the coming weeks.

Chosen Few DJ Alan King says a lot of thought will go into the virtual event.

“We’re going to encourage people to go out in their backyards and set up a tent like they would have if they went to the Chosen Few [picnic], but in their backyard or on their rooftop,” said King.

Earlier this week, the city canceled some of Chicago’s biggest summer music events, including the Blues and Gospel festivals.

So we need to cut ourselves a little slack when it comes to our expectations regarding healthy routines.

As someone who’s struggled with his weight his entire life — during the past five years, I’ve managed to lose, and keep off, 80 pounds — I offer a few thoughts for how to focus on your physical health in an age of coronavirus and social distancing.

Also, I’ve been working from home for more than five years. So I know a thing or two about making sure you’re not raiding the fridge and cupboards at every possible opportunity.

I’m not a medical professional. I was a pretty fat guy, though, so I also know a thing or two about defeating old habits, developing better ones and getting into a successful routine.

And I spent three years working on my latest book, “Big Problems: A Former Fat Guy’s Look At Why We’re Getting Fatter And What You Can Do To Fix It” (TarcherPerigree, $17), which came out Tuesday.

For the book, I interviewed doctors, body builders, trainers, nutritionists, marathon runners and more, I tried bodybuilding, long-distance running, powerlifting and even spin classes, CrossFit and yoga, to try to answer a few incredibly complex questions:

Why is it so hard to lose weight? Why is it so easy to get overweight? And what does it mean to be healthy?

With that in mind, here are some tips to help you deal with your health, eating habits and anxiety during this acceptably scary time.

Shoot for good enough, not perfection

It’s hard to have a successful routine regarding your physical health even when there isn’t a global pandemic. That’s why you should feel OK if you aren’t doing a zillion things. It’s OK to not eat “perfect.” (Perfection with your eating is a myth, by the way. There is no perfect meal. OK, maybe a pepperoni-and-sausage pan pizza from Pequod’s.)

Instead, focus on everything being good enough. Have a good enough workout (if you choose to exercise). Have a good enough meal.

Good enough right now is actually quite great.

Make a plan, do your best to follow it

If you’re concerned about your health during the lockdown, or just want to get in better shape — feel free to define this however you like, by the way — you need to make a plan. A goal without a plan is just a wish. So figure out what you’d like to work on. And some kind of structure right now is incredibly important.

If you’re concerned about eating too much while in lockdown mode, write out a meal plan that matches your goals. This can be as simple as deciding what you’re going to eat that day for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Then, you just do the plan. And try to do it good enough.

What about when you wander through the kitchen and see some goldfish crackers? Maybe you should have six handfuls? Well, go back to the plan. Did you plan for goldfish crackers? No? Then, try to not eat ‘em.

Want to exercise more or keep up some kind of existing routine? Write down what your plan is. (I’m not going to tell you how to get into exercise. My book has a lot of options on that. Also, if you Google “home workouts” you’ll find 9,174 YouTube videos that are a great start.)

Once you’ve written down your plan, try your best to follow it. If it sucks and you hate it, look up a new kind of workout to do. The best workout is the one you’ll do consistently. And if you actually like what you’re doing, odds are you’ll do it more.

If you’re just starting and haven’t regularly done exercise before, ease into it. Do less than you think you should. That’ll make it more enjoyable in the long run, trust me.

When I began lifting weights five years ago, I started in my apartment for months, using cheap dumbbells I got on Craigslist and a crappy bench that smelled like feet before moving on to a gym and also running outdoors.

Now that the gym is closed, I “lift weights” three days a week at home using cables and small dumbbells and my body weight and also go on medium-length runs two or three days a week. It’s not perfect — but it’s good enough, especially now.

Am I planning on competing in a strength competition or bodybuilding competition or a marathon in the next few months? Uh, no. Neither are you. So whatever you’re doing, it’s good enough.

Don’t want to do strenuous exercise? Try walking! One recent large-scale study in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that for every 4,000 steps a person took, regardless of their speed, their risk of dying from cancer, heart disease or anything else drops by at least 50 percent.

Just like with other endeavors, even if it’s walking, write down your plan, then try to stick to it.

For parents reading this, I know you’re being asked to do your regular job and be a teacher right now, so adding another daily task is daunting. But you need to take time to focus on yourself, too. You could always create a family workout time, even just a neighborhood walk, helping you complete your goals and your kids burn off some energy.

Focus on your mental health

One of the biggest things I discovered in my research is how much mental health plays a role in physical health. And if you are suffering from obesity currently, there’s a good chance you’re also dealing with anxiety, depression or both.

When your mental health is out of whack, it’s sometimes a full plate just to get out of bed, go to work and be productive. Trying to add other things on top of that — developing better eating habits, an exercise routine, writing that vampire-alien-werewolf-love-triangle stage play — can just be too much.

So if you don’t have the mental bandwidth to do more than you’re doing, that’s OK. Anyone who tells you differently is lying or probably has some fake productivity tool they’re trying to sell. We’re all already doing so much, and you should be proud of yourself just for making it through the day.

On this front, it might be good to not focus nonstop on the news. It can be stressful. For some, that stress can trigger overeating. Set timers for your daily social media usage and news consumption — basically a media diet. Getting your information in bigger chunks might be better than snacking throughout the day, just like with food.

Many mental health providers are offering teletherapy during the lockdown. And you can reach out to friends and family and do this thing people used to do way back in the 1990s: talk on the phone.

I just did a virtual Zoom “book party” to celebrate my launch and had people from across the country (and Canada) join in. I’ve had friends who’ve held virtual dinner parties (they all tried to make the same recipe), some who’ve had birthday parties, and one of my buddies attended a virtual wedding.

Community and connection are as important now as they were before COVID-19.

Get more sleep

Studies show you need seven to eight hours of sleep a night. Any less leads to cognitive impairment, which makes it harder to stick with good habits you’ve set up.

Whenever I hear someone say “I only need two hours of sleep to hashtag grind and be perfect!” what I am hearing someone actually say is I am a big liar. Nobody’s functioning at 100 percent if they’re sleep-deprived.

And right now we’re all dealing with more stress than we’re used to. People we know are losing their jobs and their lives. Whenever I feel any slight ailment, I worry that I’ve gotten sick. I’m concerned for my neighbors, for the businesses around me and their workers, everyone.

Getting enough sleep can help your mental health immensely. It also helps you to make healthier decisions.

If you’re mentally fatigued or physically tired, of course, you’ll eat an entire bag of sour cream and onion chips (the height of Midwestern culinary luxury) instead of making a healthier meal. If you’re tired, it’s also a lot easier to say, “I’m just too exhausted to exercise today, so I’ll do it tomorrow.” And then the next thing you know, whatever healthy routines you’ve built are gone. And you have to start over again.

In the end, we’re going to get through this. I think we’re all going to be much more empathetic than we were. You already see people coming together, helping those in need, acting selflessly.

Just remember to be good to yourself, too. This is a rough time. Nobody’s going through this perfectly. And if you had some good habits before the lockdown and they’ve kinda slid to the side, hey, maybe that’s what you need right now.

Love yourself and others. You’re doing a great job.

A yellowish-gray substance wrapped in a chilled tortilla with a side of mashed strawberries and blueberries arrived around noon on Monday.

“Surprise, Daddy! We brought you lunch,” said Matteo, my 2-year-old, beaming along with his older brother, Lucca, in the doorway to my makeshift home office.

My wife had given our children strict instructions not to disturb Daddy, and, mostly, they had complied. Sure, there were the occasional high-pitched shrieks and the wallop of what sounded like the armoire tipping over and slamming onto the ceiling above me — not to mention the “Ont some waffles!” cry from Matteo every couple of hours or so.

But after heapings of coronavirus gloom from the morning news, my children’s scrambled egg offering brought more comfort than a plate of my favorite spaghetti carbonara.

I’ve never worked from home before. I’m on Day 3 and can’t imagine this isolation lasting for another two, three, four — goodness knows how many more weeks.

But we can’t really shut out the outside world. Beside the barrage of bad news — including mounting coronavirus cases in Italy, my father’s home — my wife and I worry that Matteo, who is asthmatic, might need a trip to the emergency room, as he has a dozen or so times since his birth. I’m not a particularly religious man, but I’ve prayed about that in recent days.

But like everyone else, we are adjusting to this new reality.

I’m struck by how quiet it is in the mornings — before my children awaken. Quiet enough to hear chattering sparrows and the bird song that cuts through all of that, the whit-choo, whit-choo, whit-choo! of the northern Cardinal. Signs, too, that spring is not so far off.

This morning, we were greeted by the smiling, bearded face of “Mr. Muhammad,” Matteo’s Montessori music teacher, who could be seen on my phone strumming his guitar all alone in the school’s music room. Typically, he’s accompanied by a dozen or so bouncing toddlers, including Matteo. The day before, he’d offered a yoga class as a way to help all of us to calm down a little bit.

“Can I listen to Mr. Hammad?” Matteo said, noticing the video on my phone.

Then, not fully grasping the reality of the situation, he said, “Where’s Matteo? Where’s Logan?”

Mr. Muhammad is nothing short of a rock star in our family — a guy who will only become more revered as this thing drags on.

It’s been harder to gauge how Lucca, my 8-year-old, is doing. Not long ago, he declared, “Children are dying from the coronavirus.”

He has stopped talking about the disease in recent days. And when I sat him down and asked if he’s still worried, he assured me that he isn’t.

But it’s hard to say what’s going on in that Pokemon-obsessed head of his. At times, he’s refused to sleep in the bunk bed he’d begged us for months to buy. The other day, I found him curled up asleep on the floor in his bedroom. And Lucca, like Matteo, is more insistent than ever that I read him a bedtime story every night.

On Tuesday, Lucca brought me “lunch” — two pieces of bread that appeared to have leaped out of the toaster in fear of being browned. Lucca had smeared peanut butter on one slice and made a strawberry jam smiley face on the other.

To cool the cabin fever, I announced we were going to have a backyard baseball game on my lunch break — never mind that Dad, who grew up in England, doesn’t actually know the rules of baseball. About 10 minutes later, Matteo arrived at my office door in a shirt and, from the waist down, nothing but his birthday suit.

“I want to go out and play baseball!” he shouted.

His mother, with one arched eyebrow, followed close behind holding a diaper and questioning the timing of my announcement.

“Daddy shouldn’t have brought it up now,” she said.

So we are all adjusting. What choice do we have?

Health authorities in Hubei province, where the coronavirus first was detected in in December, reported 24 deaths and those in Beijing reported the Chinese capital’s first fatality. No national toll was announced, but 81 other deaths had been reported through Monday.

The U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, where authorities cut off most access Jan. 22 in an effort to contain the disease, was preparing to fly its diplomats and some other Americans out of the city. Japan, France and Mongolia and other governments also were preparing evacuations.

China had expanded its already sweeping disease-control efforts by extending the end of this week’s Lunar New Year holiday, the country’s busiest travel season, by three days to Sunday to keep the public at home and reduce the risk infection will spread.

Mongolia closed its vast border with China. Hong Kong and Malaysia announced they were barring entry to visitors from Hubei province. Chinese travel agencies were ordered to cancel group tours nationwide.

U.S. health officials expanded their recommendation for people to avoid non-essential travel to any part of China, rather than just Wuhan and other areas most affected by the outbreak.

On Tuesday, English-proficiency and other tests for students to apply to foreign universities were canceled. Public schools and universities have been ordered to postpone reopening following the Lunar New Year holiday until further notice.

Stock markets around the world were down sharply Monday as investors worried the outbreak could hurt the global economy.

China has confirmed more than 2,700 cases of the new virus, most in Wuhan. More than 40 cases have been confirmed elsewhere in the world. Almost involve Chinese tourists or people who visited Wuhan.

China’s increasingly drastic containment efforts began with the Jan. 22 suspension of plane, train and bus links to Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. That lockdown has expanded to 17 cities with more than 50 million people — the most far-reaching disease-control measures ever imposed.

The epidemic has revived memories of the SARS outbreak that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people. Then, Chinese authorities were criticized for reacting slowly and failing to disclose information. The government has responded more aggressively to the latest outbreak.

Wuhan is building two hospitals, one with 1,500 beds and another with 1,000, for the growing number of patients. The first is scheduled to be finished next week.

The virus is from the coronavirus family that includes the common cold but also more severe illnesses like SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. The new virus causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath and pneumonia.

The virus is thought to have spread to people from wild animals sold at a market in Wuhan. On Sunday, authorities banned trade in wild animals and urged people to stop eating meat from them.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The inaugural Pride South Side Festival in 2019 sought to create “sustainable spaces for queer youth of color on the South Side” with a series of events spanning five South Side neighborhoods, but organizers said they started pivoting to an online celebration for its second year when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the Chicago area.

Now, they’re launching an online hub for LGBTQ people of color to share artwork, as well as a two-month-long campaign encouraging LGBTQ South and West siders to complete the 2020 Census.

“In the time of social distancing, so many folks who already exist at the margins can be pushed even further into isolation, putting the mental health and well-being of our community into jeopardy,” said Dio Aldridge, director of program development for Pride South Side. “What our team set out to do is create a safe, affirming and entertaining online space that serves as a platform for black, queer or Latinx artists and content creators from the South and West sides of Chicago.”

Aldridge said this year’s campaign will focus on the same goals outlined at last year’s festival: to create space for LGBTQ people outside of the North Side, promote health and wellness and support their local economy.

In a video promoting Pride South Side’s campaign, participating artists explain how census participation can benefit LGBTQ South Siders.

“What the census hopes to provide is to get a sort of idea what your population is looking like, so you can better understand how to allocate resources,” one artist says.

Results from the 2020 Census will affect how federal funding is allocated each year.

Pride South Side has partnered with Chicago-based LGBTQ artists Vicki Street, DJ Doza the God, Roy Kinsey, Melli Domo and Kelsey Stone to provide Chicagoans with new artwork and resources every day from May 1 through June 30, which is the end of LGBTQ Pride Month.

The group, which now also partners with the 2020 Census and the Illinois Department of Human Services, hopes to reach at least 6,000 people through its online campaign and raise at least $100,000 in sales for local LGBTQ artists and the Brave Space Alliance, a South Side LGBTQ Center that’s launched a COVID-19 food delivery drive.

“It is nothing short of amazing how our team has come together and the artist community we’ve been able to cultivate for this project. We are hype and ready for what’s to come,” Aldridge said.

The announcement comes days after the city’s annual LGBTQ Pride Parade and festival were postponed until the fall due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Tim Frye, coordinator of the 2020 parade, said the event will either be rescheduled until the fall or return in 2021 and “for years to come.”

I know. Try to hold on to your hats after that explosive opening sentence.

Look, the Cubs have been around since Methuselah. Any date on the calendar is rich with history about their exploits, many of them not so wonderful.

But there’s something about May 2 . . .

Where to start? On this date in 1917, Cubs lefty Hippo Vaughn threw a nine-inning no-hitter against the Reds at Weeghman Park, which eventually would become Wrigley Field. One slight problem: Reds righty Fred Toney also threw a no-hitter, and his lasted for 10 innings. Indeed, the Cubs lost, in the only double-no-no of its kind ever.

On this date in 1956, Cubs third baseman Don Hoak struck out six times against the New York Giants at Wrigley. It remains tied in the big-league record book for the most strikeouts in a single game — only Hoak made his achievement extra special by fanning against six different Giants pitchers. Sure, it took him 17 innings to make all that magic happen, but the man was determined.

But this isn’t all about bad outcomes, in case you were beginning to wonder. May 2 has seen, for one thing, a bunch of walk-off winners by the Cubs at Wrigley.

In 1958, they beat the Milwaukee Braves 8-7 on Walt Moryn’s ninth-inning homer. Official attendance that day: 5,751.

Two years later, the Cubs gave up three runs to the Phillies in the top of the ninth, falling behind 7-5. But they responded with three of their own, winning the game when Don Zimmer knocked home Ernie Banks with a single to center. Attendance: 2,807.

In 1978, the Wrigley ramps were darn near overrun by an official crowd of — wait for it — 6,990. When Manny Trillo doubled off the Dodgers’ Mike Garman to score Rudy Meoli with the game-winner in the ninth . . . bedlam, we’re sure.

Maybe, just maybe, there was even more excitement on the second of May in 1998, when 38,430 cheered as Sammy Sosa doubled to deep left off Kent Bottenfield with two outs in the ninth to score Mark Grace from first and defeat the rival Cardinals.

Could we look back on most any day from April into September and find moments like these? Perhaps. But try telling that to the great Billy Williams, who on May 2, 1961, went 4-for-4 with a grand slam against the Giants. You can bet he still remembers a day that fine, and probably many more folks than were actually in the puny crowd of 3,334 claimed to be there to witness it.

In 1976, the Cubs won each game of a doubleheader at San Francisco in extra innings — the teams played 14 and 11, respectively. And not only that, but the games ended with identical scores of 6-5. What a crazy turn of events that was.

But the man who drove home the winning run in the second game of that doubleheader — terrific Cub Randy Hundley — couldn’t recall that at-bat when reached this week at his home in Palatine. For the record, it was a pinch-hit sacrifice fly off Greg Minton that scored Dave Rosello.

“I sure don’t,” Hundley said. “But I wasn’t playing much by then anyway. My legs were giving out on me.”

It’s true. That was the very last RBI of Hundley’s career.

Hundley, now 78, sure wishes he could be watching baseball now. He rarely misses a Cubs game in person or, more often, on TV. In non-pandemic times, mind you.

“This virus is something incredible, isn’t it?” he said. “Who would’ve ever thought of such a thing?”

Who could’ve imagined it, say, one year ago today? Last May 2, the Cubs were off after winning four straight on the road against the Diamondbacks and Mariners. A day later, they’d begin a three-game sweep of the first-place Cardinals at Wrigley, by the end of which the Cubs would have a half-game lead in the division. The Cubs would remain atop for the remainder of the month.

On that pleasant note, hey, enjoy the rest of your May 2. And be ready — you never know what might happen.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

I don’t know if sports can provide that, but it can provide a sliver of normalcy, and that’s what most of us want right now. We’d like as close to normal as we can get, as fast as we can get it.

So baseball games without fans in the seats? Yes, please. No runs, no hits, no errors and nobody in the stands? No problem. It would be strange for a while, then we’d get used to it.

But a dose of reality: Does anyone really believe a season could be played without players getting infected with the coronavirus? And does anybody really believe the season wouldn’t be shut down at the first hint of a positive test?

Major League Baseball is considering a plan in which its 30 teams would compete at spring-training sites in the Phoenix area, as well as at the Diamondbacks’ ballpark, possibly as soon as May. Players, coaches and essential personnel would live in hotels away from their families.

If there’s a more miserable existence than being isolated with 25 major-league ballplayers for five months, it has yet to be invented. I know: You’d sequester yourself with 25 telemarketers if it meant millions of dollars in your bank account. But in the case of ballplayers, that’s a lot of video games, ornery personalities, hunting stories and pent-up, um, urges. If Phoenix-area bars were to open during the season, would you trust a libidinous teammate to continue watching reruns of “Baywatch”? And how soon before he brings COVID-19 to the clubhouse?

To rally the troops for ninth-inning comebacks, managers like to say, “All it takes is one.’’ One hit to turn the tide. And all it takes is one positive test to shut down the season again.

I want this to work. I find it hard to believe it can.

Players take infield practice before each game, touching baseballs that have been in the hand of the coach hitting to them. The players throw those baseballs to a first baseman, who also touches them. It’s a germfest out there. A pitcher and catcher touch the same ball often during the game. A batboy delivers balls to the umpire several times over nine innings. Et cetera.

And spitting! It’s what baseball players do between breaths. They spit saliva, they spit sunflower seeds and some still spit tobacco. They spit when they wake up, and they spit when they go to bed. It’s reasonable to expect that they’ll spit wherever they sit during games. It’s reasonable to expect that teammates will step on those expectorations, spreading whatever there is to be spread.

Little things we take for granted will come with question marks. The big things — one player sliding into another, trading sweat — seem like major stumbling blocks. I’m assuming teammates will be sharing clubhouse washrooms, showers and weight rooms. Who will be cleaning players’ hotel rooms? Serving food to them? Hard to believe those people will be cloistered from their families, too.

(I’m not worried about mound visits. Players have been talking through their gloves for years. It’s baseball’s version of N95 masks.)

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it’s possible for pro sports to return in 2020.

“There’s a way of doing that,” he said on “Good Luck America,” an interview series from Snapchat. “(No fans come) to the stadium. Put (the players) in big hotels wherever you want to play. Keep them very well-surveilled and have them tested, like every week, and make sure they don’t wind up infecting each other or their family and just let them play the season out.”

Scientists in China have found that people infected with COVID-19 likely are spreading the disease for up to 2½ days before showing symptoms. Or, as the Los Angeles Times puts it, “an infected person can walk around feeling fine for more than two full days while spewing virus into the air, depositing it onto doorknobs and handrails, and sowing the seeds for future infections.’’

Play ball!

This brings us to the feeling of being stuck, which is one of the dark byproducts of the coronavirus. We can’t live our lives in the fear of something bad happening, but what if the odds are decent that something bad will indeed happen? Should we carry on anyway? Or should we wait for a vaccine, which might not be available for a year?

The nation is facing the same questions. When do we reopen society? Is there ever a point where the health of the economy is as important as the health of the citizenry?

Sports are being presented as a national balm to help us get through the pandemic. We know it’s really about the billions of TV dollars, but we don’t care. We want baseball back.

Oddsmakers and statisticians from Sports Betting Dime have run projections of the likelihood that a fan would be infected by an asymptomatic carrier of COVID-19 while attending a sporting event. The projections are broken down by city, and factor in each city’s projected COVID-19 peak date — for Illinois that is April 17 — along with various presumptive league start dates.

They looked at nine cities, including Chicago, that have MLB, NBA and NHL franchises and how the probability of infection would change based on different league dates of June 1, June 15 or July 1.

The study assumes continued social distancing measures throughout the summer and further assumes standard game behavior by fans and uses the average crowd size from the previous season for each venue.

The numbers were similar among the three leagues, but they don’t look encouraging for sports fans looking to get back into a stadium anytime soon.

If Major League Baseball opens on June 1 at Wrigley Field (assuming an average attendance of 38,208), 818 people — or 2.16% — would be infected with the coronavirus. With a June 15 start date, that number drops to 204 infections (0.54%), but if MLB were to begin on July 1, there would be 92 people infections (0.24%).

If the NBA or NHL restarted at the United Center with an average attendance of 18,804, there would be 395 people infected (2.12%) with a June 1 restart date. If they begin on June 15, 99 people would be infected (0.53%) and July 1 would yield 44 infections (0.24%).

Nationwide the numbers vary according to the projected peak date of the virus. The projections put Chicago on the lower end of infection rates, with an 88% drop from 2.16% to 0.24% probability of infection if the start date is pushed back from June 1 to July 1. Boston and New York have a projected peak date one day sooner than Chicago on April 16. Their infection rate starts at roughly 0.54% for June 1 and drops to 0.05% on July 1. Miami doesn’t peak until May 2 and therefore their infection rate at an NBA or NHL game is 29.17% for a June 1 start, dropping to 13.82% with start on July 1.

Even with the later July 1 start date and a relatively low infection rate projected for Chicago, the exponentially increasing nature of the virus still means that each newly infected person will contribute to a swift inflation of the curve. Until we have more effective measures in place to combat the coronavirus, fans are a long way away from being able to safely watch sports in a stadium or an arena.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

What would such a player, and potentially his teammates, need to do next?

NBC’s Peter King posed the question this weekend to Dr. Anthony Fauci.

Canceling or postponing a game, Fauci said, could be required steps. Depending if one or more members of a team test positive, a two-week team quarantine may be necessary, too.

“Absolutely,” said Fauci, director of the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “It would be malpractice in medicine to put him on the field, absolutely.”

Fauci said it’s too early to predict whether NFL teams can safely commence their seasons four months from now, as scheduled. The country’s response to the disease, increased availability to testing and potential immunity from exposure all are expected to evolve between now and then.

But Fauci said the NFL must be willing not only to sideline a player who tests positive for COVID-19 but also take more drastic measures if more than one player does so.

“You got a problem there,” he said in an interview for King’s Football Morning in America column. “You know why? Because it is likely that if four of them are positive and they’ve been hanging around together, that the other ones that are negative are really positive. So I mean, if you have one outlier [only one player testing positive], I think you might get away.

“But once you wind up having a situation where it looks like it’s spread within a team, you got a real problem. You gotta shut it down.”

Fauci isn’t convinced the 2020 NFL season will need to be canceled or even necessarily postponed. Playing tackle football right now would be “impossible,” Fauci said — but by September, he speculates it could be “feasible” players who test negative could compete, either without fans or with a reduced number of fans attending, with at least 6 feet between them. Regular testing of players would be imperative, Fauci said, as would the production of many more rapid-response COVID-19 tests.

“Right now, it would be overwhelmingly piggish” to procure as many virus tests as the NFL would need for an uninterrupted season, Fauci said. “But by the end of August, we should have in place antigen testing. … You could test millions of people, millions.

“Given the country we have, such a rich country, I would be very surprised if we can’t do that.”

So what will decide whether, and in what fashion, the NFL plays in September?

Fauci said the unpredictable factors hinge largely on testing availability and how prevalent COVID-19 is come fall.

“It will be entirely dependent on the effectiveness with which we as a society respond to the inevitable outbreak that will occur,” he told King. “What is going to be the effectiveness of our response?

“In my mind, shame on us if we don’t have in place all of the mechanisms to prevent it from blowing up again. In other words, enough testing to test everybody that needs to be tested. Enough testing so that when someone gets infected, you could immediately do contact tracing and isolation to prevent the infection from going to a couple of infections to hundreds of infections. That’s how you control an outbreak.”

That type of thinking led the league office to prepare a standard 16-game schedule for the 2020 season — an audacious move considering all 32 team facilities are closed indefinitely. It comes out Thursday night, about a month later than it typically has, though the NFL said it had been considering moving the highly anticipated annual release to May anyway.

It’s as if the league refuses to concede in any way that the outbreak might derail it.

Odds are, it will.

The conversation around the coronavirus started with “weeks” before quickly shifting to months and now years. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Tuesday he can’t foresee gatherings of more than 50 people until the final phase of recovery, which won’t be this year. An NFL traveling party is triple that.

It’s fine to hope for the best, but the league needs to plan for the worst. A shortened season would undoubtedly result in some inequitable scheduling, so if the NFL were prudent, it would take that into account within the 16-game slate.

If football can’t start on time with a Thursday night opener Sept. 10, the league needs to establish priorities.

Every team’s six divisional games should be held the last six weeks of the season to provide the best chance of keeping those matchups intact. If it was only possible to play six games, those are the six that matter the most.

On the flip side, the cross-conference games should come first in the schedule. For the Bears, that means home games against the Texans and Colts and road games against the Jaguars and Titans.

The reasoning is clear: Intra-conference games are more important in determining playoff spots. And this will be the first season in which seven teams make the playoffs from each conference, by the way.

There has been speculation about the league leaving open the possibility of taking the first four games of the season and tacking them on the back end of the schedule — meaning they’d be played throughout January — if needed, but that seems unlikely. Taking the regular season through the end of January and having the playoffs in February would require the Super Bowl moving to March.

The Super Bowl is awarded three to five years in advance because of the massive amount of planning necessary to host it. It’s not so simple to bump it back a month. There’s a far greater likelihood of the NFL canceling the first four weeks than delaying the Super Bowl.

One element that would maintain fairness is to have every team alternate home and road games rather than have the occasional three-game homestand or back-to-back road games. That gives the NFL the best chance to have every team play the same number of home dates if it has to cancel games.

It’s rare to have this level of mystery going into an NFL schedule release. The Bears-centric drama generally revolves around when the Packers games are and how many prime-time slots the team gets.

It’s usually a bit anticlimactic because opponents are predetermined by the NFL scheduling model and have been known since December.

The Bears will play each opponent in the NFC North twice. They’ll also host the Saints, Giants, Buccaneers, Texans and Colts. They’ll travel to the Rams, Falcons, Titans, Jaguars and Panthers. That’s the plan, anyway.

But that’s not why everyone’s waiting for the schedule to drop. Pro football will become the first team sport in America with a plan to resume games. And that plan will be interesting, but it’ll also be hard to believe.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Blackhawks’ Attendance History Season Attendance Rank Season Attendance Rank 2019-20 21,441 1st 2018-19 21,339 1st 2017-18 21,653 1st 2016-17 21,751 1st 2015-16 21,859 1st 2014-15 21,769 1st 2013-14 21,616 1st 2012-13 21,775 1st 2011-12 21,553 1st 2010-11 21,423 1st 2009-10 21,356 1st 2008-09 21,783 1st

And while there is increasing optimism leaguewide that the 2019-20 regular season eventually will restart, there’s little chance that resumption will take place in Chicago and even lower odds that fans will be able to attend the rescheduled games.

After all, the logistics of hosting a crowd of 20,000-plus in the coronavirus era — not to mention the various governmental bans across the United States and Canada, including in Illinois, on large public gatherings — would be impossible.

Even looking ahead to 2020-21, it’s very possible that part or all of the season could be played without fans.

The NHL reportedly is looking at another strange calendar for the coming season. If the 2020 Stanley Cup isn’t awarded until September, as the latest resumption plan suggests, the 2020-21 season might not start until December and might not end until July. And the league has no control over COVID-19 test and vaccine availability, both of which will have a huge effect on when spectators safely can return to large sporting arenas.

So the Hawks can chalk up the 2019-20 attendance title as theirs without much hesitation. But the fact that it might be a while before they get a chance to defend that title somewhat overrides the positivity.

Plus, longtime president John McDonough — widely credited as the mastermind behind the Hawks’ marketing and ticket-sales dynasty that coincided with the team’s on-ice dynasty — is gone after nearly 13 years in the position.

Although much mystery about the reasons for McDonough’s firing remains, the plummeting resale value of Hawks tickets and the starting-to-decline number of season-ticket holders — two trends that threaten to break the sellout streak — might have been factors.

In other words, 2019-20 might prove to be the last season of league-leading attendance on Madison Street.

2019-20 Attendance Review

• The Hawks’ average crowd of 21,441 represented a small increase from the average of 21,339 last season, ending a streak of four annual declines.

• The largest crowd (21,878) came when the Hawks hosted the Predators on Feb. 21.

• The smallest crowd (21,172) came when the Hawks hosted the Golden Knights on Oct. 22.

• A crowd of 21,275 attended the Hawks’ game against the Sharks on March 11, the day before the season was halted.

• The average weekday crowd was 21,444, four more than the average weekend crowd of 21,440.

• Games against Central Division rivals were slightly more popular, drawing an average of 21,519 fans, compared with 21,405 for non-division games.

• The Hawks had 19 home games start at 7:30 p.m. and averaged 21,435 fans at those games. They had 15 games start at other times (although only one before 6 p.m.) and averaged 21,448 fans at those.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The rationale was that if the league went straight into the postseason whenever hockey returned, bubble teams like the Jets and Blue Jackets would be unfairly denied opportunities to battle for spots down the stretch.

To resolve that injustice, the NHL mentioned potentially expanding the field. The most likely scenario was 10 per conference, but there were whispers of 12 as well — and, lo and behold, the Blackhawks ranked 12th in the West when the season stopped.

The thought that this mediocre-at-best Hawks team — six points out of a real wild card spot, with mere 3.4 percent playoff odds (per Moneypuck) — would get automatically inserted anyway was absurd but exciting.

That was weeks ago, though. Now, there’s growing optimism that the NHL will resume its season in July at one common, neutral location per division — most likely Minnesota for the Central Division — and conclude the regular season in part or full before beginning the playoffs.

That would result in the Stanley Cup being awarded in September, per a Wednesday AP report, and the 2020-21 season probably starting late. Nonetheless, it seems like the most thorough and developed plan yet.

For hockey in general, it’s great news. For the Blackhawks, though, it’s arguably disappointing: it will likely equate to much ado for a few weeks of largely meaningless games, then a return to the same nothingness that has filled April.

The real drama with the Hawks franchise right now lies off the ice, where John McDonough’s Monday firing opened up endless possibilities for the front office.

On the ice, there are approximately zero possibilities: no chance of making the playoffs, no chance of tanking for a top draft pick (barring another lottery miracle).

Corey Crawford, Malcolm Subban and Slater Koekkoek would be playing for new contracts, and Olli Maatta and Zack Smith to avoid juicy potential buyouts. And that’s about it.

Simply having hockey back at all would be rejoiced by the whole league, and the Hawks’ resident hockey nerds — Patrick Kane and Dylan Strome chief among them — would surely enjoy even watching the playoffs.

But as far as motivation to endure another training camp, an unavoidable quarantine away from family and friends and the physical bruising of several weeks of games, the Hawks would be sorely lacking.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The odds of that happening — whenever the offseason ends up taking place — have only increased in the last two months.

The NHL already has lost a significant chunk of revenue because of the season pause, and if the season is canceled or only somewhat resumed, that chunk will get larger.

And since the salary cap is directly correlated to league revenues — it’s technically half the upcoming season’s projected revenue, divided by 31 — that huge financial fallout could quickly spill down to the player’s pockets.

The Hawks already were looking at a salary-cap crunch, even with the cap expected to rise from its current $81.5 million to the $84 million-$88 million range. But if the cap stays around $81.5 million — which players were reportedly informed recently will likely be the case — general manager Stan Bowman’s situation could get even more dire.

That could affect the Hawks’ ability to re-sign pending free agents such as Dylan Strome, Dominik Kubalik and Corey Crawford.

But it also could — alternately, or perhaps simultaneously — lead to one or two buyouts of Hawks players with years left on their contracts.

Under the standard buyout rules — which are complicated and highly variable but generally spread out a player’s expected cap hit over more years at a lower amount per year — the Hawks have two prime candidates: defenseman Olli Maatta and forward Zack Smith.

Maatta was acquired from the Penguins last summer to help fix the Hawks’ defense. He didn’t have an outright bad debut season, but he made little difference. Maatta finished with 17 points and a 47.5 percent scoring-chance ratio (per Natural Stat Trick) in 65 games.

He has two years remaining at an expensive $4.08 million cap hit per year, and it just so happens that his contract is buyout-friendly. It would result in a mere $680,000 cap hit for the next four years, per Capfriendly.

Olli Maatta Buyout Data Season Current Cap Hit Buyout Cap Hit Savings Season Current Cap Hit Buyout Cap Hit Savings 2020-21 4,083,333 680,600 3,402,733 2021-22 4,083,333 680,400 3,402,933 2022-23 0 680,567 -680,567 2023-24 0 680,567 -680,567

The Hawks acquired Smith from the Senators last summer while dumping Artem Anisimov’s contract.

But Smith, too, is heavily overpaid (one year remaining at $3.25 million) for a slowing-down fourth-liner. He finished with 11 points and a team-worst 40.4 percent scoring-chance ratio in 50 games, then was ruled out for the season with a back injury.

His contract is slightly less buyout-friendly than Maatta’s, but he’s also a far more expendable player. A buyout would create a cap hit slightly under $1.1 million for the next two seasons.

Zack Smith Buyout Data Season Current Cap Hit Buyout Cap Hit Savings Season Current Cap Hit Buyout Cap Hit Savings 2020-21 3,250,000 1,083,333 2,166,667 2021-22 0 1,083,333 -1,083,333

Meanwhile, the NHL could look into offering compliance buyouts, which completely erase contracts from the books with no penalties. The league offered these in the 2013 and 2014 offseasons after the 2012-13 lockout stalled cap growth.

In this scenario, the choice would be clear for the Hawks: Brent Seabrook’s contract is an albatross. He’s due $6.875 million for four more seasons. Despite Seabrook’s admirable fight back from three surgeries during the winter, Bowman would be delusional not to use a compliance buyout on the one-time defensive stalwart.

Brent Seabrook Compliance Buyout Data Season Current Cap Hit Buyout Cap Hit Savings Season Current Cap Hit Buyout Cap Hit Savings 2020-21 6,875,000 0 6,875,000 2021-22 6,875,000 0 6,875,000 2022-23 6,875,000 0 6,875,000 2023-24 6,875,000 0 6,875,000

But a conventional buyout remains impractical. Most of Seabrook’s cap hit is packed into a signing bonus that can’t be mitigated in any way.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The Hawks canceled the 13th edition of the event — slated for July 24-26 — on Wednesday, citing the uncertain status of the rest of the 2019-20 NHL season and the advice of public-health officials. Full refunds for previously purchased convention passes and hotel rooms will be issued.

The 2019 convention drew thousands of fans to downtown Chicago for autograph sessions, meet-and-greets, new-player introductions, alumni and front-office panels and numerous other types of programming. It spanned from Friday night through Sunday afternoon, just as this edition was supposed to do.

Illinois’ ban on large gatherings — although it doesn’t extend anywhere near late July yet — theoretically would make the convention impossible. And even if the ban were to be lifted by then, many fans might be reluctant to attend, given the close proximity they would have with thousands of others, leading to attendance concerns.

There’s also a chance the NHL season will resume around that point of the summer, although a plethora of obstacles would lie in the way of that.

If the season does resume, the most likely way would seem to be in a single, neutral-site city, ideally one with relatively few coronavirus cases but with infrastructure sufficient enough to house thousands of players, coaches, league officials, TV crews and more. Even still, the games almost certainly would be held in empty arenas.

So far, cities reportedly under consideration are Grand Forks, North Dakota; Manchester, New Hampshire; and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Grand Forks is home to the University of North Dakota’s hockey facilities. Manchester’s SNHU Arena is the former home of a Kings minor-league affiliate. Saskatoon’s spacious SaskTel Centre typically hosts the Blades of the Western Hockey League.

But the NHL is far away from making any serious commitments to such sites, and little is known about what the format the end of the season would look like. Unless the regular season was resumed or the playoff field was expanded, the Hawks wouldn’t take part.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Kane, the Islanders’ Mathew Barzal and the Jets’ Mark Scheifele spent 45 minutes on a video conference call Monday laughing and poking fun at each other through entertaining pick-’em and trivia games.

Whom would Kane want with him in a three-on-three game, excluding Hawks teammates? The Maple Leafs’ Auston Matthews and the Kings’ Drew Doughty.

Whom would he not want to face on a breakaway? The Canadiens’ Carey Price or the Lightning’s Andrei Vasilevskiy.

Whom would he want with him on a two-on-one? The Rangers’ Artemi Panarin.

‘‘That was probably the funnest hockey I’ve ever played,’’ Kane added to his Panarin answer, providing a quote that instantly went viral on Twitter.

Sure, Kane might be stuck inside his Chicago condominium. And, sure, he has been watching NBC Sports Chicago’s replays of the Hawks’ 2010 Stanley Cup run and playing Xbox video games for the first time in years. But those time-fillers don’t compare to the excitement of live hockey. (The Pilates studio in his building — his temporary training center — isn’t exactly the same as Fifth Third Arena, either.)

Just like the rest of society, however, he’s finding a way to make the most of the downtime. As a result, the conference call was as entertaining as a period of preseason hockey.

It turns out the same can be said for much of the rest of the NHL. In fact, the league-run calls that have sprung up by the dozens in recent weeks — Hawks captain Jonathan Toews’ appearance March 31 turned out to be only the tip of the iceberg — have provided more insight into players’ daily lives, hobbies and personalities than a normal season does.

The calls rarely have been newsworthy — Doughty did drop a relative bombshell on another call Monday, when he said he doesn’t see how the season is going to return — but they have been lively, playful and thoroughly engrossing, representing a huge difference from typical locker-room interviews.

The best part of Toews’ call came when he and the Blues’ Alex Pietrangelo meandered into discussing old-school montages of NHL hits on YouTube. Kane’s call had even more laugh-out-loud moments, such as when Barzal forgot which college Islanders general manager Lou Lamoriello led to the 1983 Frozen Four.

‘‘Those contract negotiations just got a little bit tougher,’’ Kane quipped.

Once the coronavirus pandemic ends and hockey returns, the calls inevitably will fade from the NHL’s media procedures. But the league, which long has fostered an atmosphere that discourages players from speaking out about personal thoughts and passions, would be wise to learn from the calls’ popularity.

The NBA’s culture of individualism has translated perfectly to the 21st-century sports world, especially its social-media component. The NHL’s culture of always-team-first homogeneity hasn’t, for better or worse.

But it’s clear the stars of the NHL can juggle showing their human side and representing their team. Kane didn’t compromise any of his talent, mystique or respect by joking around on the call, but he did make himself seem like more of a real person.

If one silver lining of the shutdown proves to be a greater emphasis on candid, lighthearted discussion among the NHL’s biggest names in future seasons, the league might emerge from the pandemic in a better place than it entered it.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

As of Thursday, a whopping 774,840 pounds of rice, beans, pasta, tuna, tomato sauce, peanut butter, canned vegetables and other non-perishable items filled every inch of the normal playing surface.

The result is a stunning photo exemplifying the 21,000-seat arena’s abrupt transformation from sporting venue — in a coronavirus-free alternate reality, it would have been prepped for the scheduled Bulls-Nets game on Saturday — to pandemic logistics hub.

The food has been relocated to free up space in the Greater Chicago Food Depository’s main warehouse, according to GCFD senior manager Greg Trotter.

“They’ve been piling up in our warehouse, and they are going into our network, but we’re trying to store some, too,” Trotter said. “We have a feeling that things are going to become significantly worse, in terms of food insecurity, in the weeks to come.”

Roughly two-thirds of the GCFD’s network of food pantries remain open, but they have shifted to a ‘grab-and-go’ format where food-insecure families simply pick up prepackaged boxes or bags, instead of the pre-pandemic method of shopping for the specific kinds of food they wanted.

That’s not the only effect that social distancing guidelines have had on the food depository, either. In the warehouse — located in Archer Heights on the southwest side of the city — volunteers who pack such bags and boxes must now be spaced out more, meaning there’s less room to store food.

And that’s where the United Center comes in.

Trotter said that while the number of coronavirus cases in Chicago may level off in the coming weeks, the depository expects the economic impact of the pandemic — and, specifically, the number of Chicagoans in need of food — to last far longer.

“There’s still going to be a long tail on this crisis,” he said. “People who have been laid off or their income has taken a hit, they’re going to have to get their lives back. This is not something that’s going to be resolved anytime soon.”

“Our neighbors are going to need our help for a long time. We’re bracing for that reality.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Instead, they’re now more than three weeks removed from their most recent game, and the odds of the 12 remaining scheduled ones ever being played are decreasing by the day. Most of the team also has left Chicago to ride out the pandemic in their respective hometowns and home countries, Jonathan Toews said earlier this week.

But two players — goaltender Robin Lehner and defenseman Erik Gustafsson — left Chicago a few weeks earlier.

As the trade deadline approached on Feb. 24, the NHL had successfully concluded the last 100 seasons it had begun. So the league conducted its newsiest day in typical chaotic fashion, and for the Hawks, that included shipping off Lehner and Gustafsson, pending free agents, for rebuilding assets.

The trades were criticized at the time — not that they took place but rather for the meager returns they brought.

A Vezina Trophy-caliber goalie for a second-round pick, average prospect (Slava Demin) and throw-in backup (Malcolm Subban) wasn’t a fair trade. A sometimes-elite offensive defenseman, although not so much this season, for a mere third-round pick wasn’t, either.

“The we-might-as-well trades Monday must not be interpreted as we-had-to trades — or, worse yet, it’ll-fix-things trades,” I wrote at the time.

Yet unbeknownst to Lehner, Gustafsson and Hawks general manager Stan Bowman, the season would be paused just over two weeks later.

The NHL still has not officially canceled the rest of the regular season or provided any deadline by which the postseason would need to begin, but given cancellation trends around the rest of the sports and entertainment industries, an eventual resumption feels tenuous.

Lehner, for one, has mentally written it off.

“You can’t turn 180 degrees and start playing again,” he told a Swedish newspaper last week. “I see a zero percent chance that you can save this season. Now I hope that next season can start as usual in October.”

So the roughly 20 regular-season games and hopefully multiple playoff series that the Golden Knights and Flames thought they’d get out of Lehner and Gustafsson, respectively, might end up being only a handful of meaningless games.

That would make the tepid prices they paid feel like exorbitant wastes of assets in hindsight, especially if one or both choose not to re-sign as unrestricted free agents whenever the offseason occurs. And, in turn, that would make Bowman’s decision to sell low on both players seem wiser, simply because he sold at all.

In the end, Lehner made only three appearances for Vegas before the shutdown. He was characteristically stellar in those games — going 3-0-0 with a .940 save percentage — but still barely had time to debut his new gold-and-black pads, much less make an actual impact on the franchise.

Gustafsson played in seven games for the Flames, with no goals and three assists, and made even less of an impact. His average ice time dropped from 20:40 with the Hawks to 18:01 with Calgary, and his shot-attempt (Corsi) ratio was an ugly 42.5 percent in those seven appearances.

The Hawks could even bring back both as free agents, although Gustafsson didn’t appear to be in their long-term plans and Lehner had harsh words for the Hawks’ front office — a recurring habit when discussing his former teams — after his trade.

Even if the Hawks don’t, however, they still come out of this strange, messy spring looking — albeit inadvertently — shrewder than they did a month ago.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

In a video conference call Tuesday with fellow Central Division captains Alex Pietrangelo (Blues) and Roman Josi (Predators), Toews ended the Hawks’ coronavirus quarantine silence by reflecting on the sudden stoppage, his lifestyle since and his outlook on what lies ahead.

Except he already had forgotten the Hawks’ final opponent — the Sharks — before the stoppage. And, apparently, the days of the week. The Hawks and Sharks played Wednesday, March 11.

‘‘We basically woke up in the morning Friday,’’ Toews said. ‘‘We played Thursday night — I forget who we even played at home — but they said, ‘Don’t come in to the rink,’ and the season turned on a dime just like that.’’

To be fair, for the last three weeks, Toews has lived a lifestyle unfamiliar to him in prior Marches.

He has been cooped up with his girlfriend and their Yorkshire terrier, binge-watching ‘‘Ozark’’ and relaxing to ‘‘deep house’’ music.

He has tried to keep the Hawks’ meme-laden group chat under control, even as one of the relatively few players riding out the pandemic in Chicago. (In related news Tuesday, the NHL extended the self-isolation period for players to April 15.)

‘‘I didn’t have that motivation to do much the first four or five days,’’ Toews said. ‘‘Since then, I’ve been getting back and riding the bike and thinking: ‘Hey, at some point, this has to wrap up. We’ve got to go back to our normal lives.’

‘‘Just not sure when that is, so hopefully it’s sooner rather than later.’’

Toews said he has watched news broadcasts and listened to Joe Rogan podcasts to educate himself about the pandemic. He also has taken advantage of the free time to attend to some previously neglected responsibilities.

‘‘I moved into a new place during the season this year, and . . . during the year, you put a lot on the back burner with how busy the schedule was,’’ he said. ‘‘Just catching up, calling some friends, little things I don’t have time to do when we’re in season.’’

Toews also has had plenty of time to watch old hockey highlights and reflect about the gradual transformation of the league and the sport. That nostalgia led to a fascinating conversation with Pietrangelo and Josi when the moderator on the call temporarily lost his connection.

‘‘I’ve definitely had the time to sit back and watch these guys in the playoffs and the runs they’ve been on the last two years while I’m just sitting at home in April, May, June,’’ Toews said. ‘‘But the last time we won [the Stanley Cup] in 2015, Tampa was that first example of where the game was headed. They had smaller [defensemen] and forwards that could skate, and it wasn’t as physical of a series as we had against Anaheim in the conference final.

‘‘That’s where the game has really gone nowadays. Every team can really skate. They’ve got forwards and D-men on all four lines that can fly. I’ve just been watching some of those games and seeing how it compares to the playoff games in ’15 and ’13 and all those years.’’

That insight was particularly interesting when paired with some comments he made about the Hawks earlier in the call. That included mentioning how the injuries to veterans this season were counterbalanced by the growth of the rookies.

‘‘We showed a lot of signs this year, even if we weren’t sitting in a playoff spot right now, that we’re right on the edge,’’ Toews said.

For now, however, all he can do is wait to see whether the Hawks’ next chance to hop over that edge comes later this spring or next season.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

That’s still the case this year, even though the season is technically alive and it’s unclear how the AHL will proceed if it resumes or when the next one will begin.

Jon Sata, the Wolves’ senior vice president of partnerships and business development said the franchise would be ready if this season restarted, but “most everything is pointed toward a start next season.” There are already some provisional dates for the next campaign, and as of Wednesday, the league’s plan was that 2020-21 would be business as usual in the fall until it’s not.

“Our first wave of planning has an early October start for games and that we’ll play a traditional season,” Sata said. “The Plan B looks like a delayed start to the season and the potential of a truncated season thereafter. I think the way that we’re approaching it is planning for the full schedule, and then if we have to pare it down, we’ll adjust -accordingly.”

Sata said the Wolves would work with Allstate Arena on scheduling because, like other venues, arena management will try to rebook the events lost during the spring, summer and potentially the fall. That means the building could have a very busy slate even before the Wolves’ home schedule is plotted.

“It’s a big puzzle that we’re doing our best to stay on top of,” Sata said. “We’ll have it put together when we’re ready to go.”

When that happens is anybody’s guess.

On April 24, AHL president and CEO David Andrews said on SiriusXM that the league is beginning to pivot toward the 2020-21 season. Playing games without fans, Andrews said, would be very unlikely because the AHL is a gate-driven league.

Andrews said the AHL is building for an October start next season and needs to be ready for that possibility. But it also must look for operating models beginning in November, December and January.

Presumably, one part of the equation for teams is adjusting for an economy that will look much different than it did March 8, when the Wolves last hosted a game. Sata, however, sounded confident that wouldn’t affect the Wolves as much because of their ticket prices.

“If the economy is challenged when this starts again, which it likely will be, I think we’re in a favorable spot,” Sata said.

Sata said a larger worry is people’s comfort in a public setting. The Wolves will follow all public guidelines. The Village of Rosemont, which owns and operates Allstate Arena, will be committed to following those rules and making sure that the building is safe, with precautions such as touch-free sinks, soap dispensers and overly aggressive sterilization and cleaning measures.

But in general, Sata is trying to keep things in perspective and find some positives. The stoppage and the complications it has caused are a hassle for the sports world, but compared to what other people are dealing with, these are “first-world problems” for the Wolves.

The time has allowed the Wolves to catch their breath, evaluate the business and maybe come out a better organization.

“This is tough, this is challenging, but some of the best outcomes come from adverse situations,” Sata said. “We need to push through that and maintain positivity and find some positivity in this.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

After starting the season in the NHL before getting sent to the Wolves in November, Pirri had earned his third Vegas recall in the last month and seemed to be back in the Golden Knights’ plans.

Then the pandemic stopped the season and Pirri’s latest shot in the NHL. But Pirri, 29, is keeping it all in perspective.

“I am aware of what’s going on,” said Pirri, who was sent back to the Wolves on March 14. “It was good to be back up, but at the same time it’s a game. It’s a sport, and wherever I am I get to play hockey for a living, and I feel very fortunate. Health and safety is everything, and it is what it is. I’m sure I’m not the only guy going through this, and to be kind of frustrated by it isn’t going to do me any good, or basically anyone else, because it’s just a matter of getting through this time and taking care of one another.”

Pirri has spread that message through All In Illinois, a state initiative stressing the importance of sheltering at home. Pirri recorded a television commercial for All In, lending his voice along with luminaries such as Hillary Clinton, Common and Chance the Rapper, and sports figures like Mike Singletary, Patrick Kane, David Ross, Jim Thome and Toni Kukoc. During the 56-second spot, Pirri says he’s really happy to live in a state that has taken the pandemic so seriously, talks about how many of life’s biggest moments took place in Illinois, and said “us non-essential workers need to stay home and do our part together.”

Pirri said he was asked through the Wolves to participate and hopes his voice could influence people to be safe and help stop the spread of the virus. After all, Pirri is going through this just like everyone else. He even had to tell his two-year-old son, Luca, that the park was closed.

“I saw Kaner did it, so if people are listening to him, that’s huge,” Pirri said. “The more people that can get behind this, the sooner we all can get through it, because the whole flatten-the-curve idea seems to be the only way we’re going to get back to our normal lives. I was asked to do it, and that’s an easy ask.”

If the curve is flattened, maybe the season can continue in some form. When the season was halted, Pirri indicated he thought the games would return and that a solution could be found somewhat quickly. But as more information came out, he came to the realization this wouldn’t be over quickly.

“At first I was thinking stay ready, and now [I’m] waiting it out like everyone else,” Pirri said. “Obviously, there’s only so many pushups and situps you can do, but that’s just kind of the way it is right now. It would be great to be playing hockey, but the world’s got to figure out a bigger issue right now.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

It’s a stressful occasion even in the best circumstances, but Evie Marie arrived March 30 in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.

‘‘Once the baby is born, you’ve got another person that you’re in charge of that you need to protect,’’ Megna said. ‘‘It’s obviously not an ideal time with everything going on, but the one benefit is that I’ve been able to be around for everything. It’s been just over a week, and it’s been amazing.’’

Evie’s birth originally was scheduled for the Chicago area, but the suspension of the American Hockey League season and the league allowing players to leave their home markets afforded the Megnas an opportunity to switch plans. They chose to bring Evie into the world at Lehigh Valley Hospital in Allentown, Pennsylvania, near Kasey’s parents’ home.

The Megnas needed one day to reach Kasey’s parents’ home — where they’re currently staying — to prepare for the birth.

‘‘It was definitely stressful,’’ Megna said. ‘‘Just getting here was a little stressful, just making sure nothing happened while we were driving, considering she was only two weeks from her due date when we were getting here. More so for my wife, it being our first kid, going through the whole process and being at a hospital, it is a bit overwhelming.’’

Once the Megnas got to the hospital for Evie’s birth, they weren’t there long. They were told Kasey normally would be in the hospital for three nights, but she and Evie spent only 36 hours there before going home. Once doctors saw they were healthy, they were allowed to depart early.

‘‘It was definitely a bit of a different experience, I would assume, than most,’’ Megna said. ‘‘It was still amazing.’’

Other than medical staff, only one person was allowed to be in the delivery room. Masks were mandatory when visitors entered, and Megna couldn’t leave even for food or water.

‘‘Everything you needed, you had to call and they would bring it to you,’’ Megna said. ‘‘Three days of that might’ve been a little much. We were lucky we were able to get out of there quickly and safely.’’

Though the circumstances might have been unorthodox, Megna said he has no complaints about the experience.

Kasey and Evie are doing well, and Megna expects his parents soon will be able to meet their new granddaughter. He praised the medical staff that cared for his family, and the AHL hiatus has allowed him to spend more time with his infant daughter and recovering wife.

If the season hadn’t been halted, Megna would have been able to be at Evie’s birth, but he would have missed out on many other moments he has witnessed.

‘‘It’s been pretty special,’’ Megna said. ‘‘There’s a lot going on, but we’re staying home like we’re supposed to, and it’s been a big opportunity to get to see my daughter quite a bit. She’s already changing so much. Helping to take care of my wife in her recovery. She’s been a champ.’’",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

But Levin has an idea about when he thinks it needs to restart.

“A lot of our teams want to play; they do want to play,” Levin told the Sun-Times. “The question is, can they play? If May 1 turns out to be a hard date, maybe we can. If it gets pushed any past that, I think probably not.”

Like the rest of the North American sports world, the Wolves and the AHL are waiting for their next steps. They’re watching to see how the COVID-19 pandemic plays out and whether it will dissipate enough to allow the season to come back. And if it does return, how it would look is uncertain.

The ECHL already has canceled its season. And on Monday, the AHL announced its indefinite suspension won’t be lifted before May.

In most cases, the criteria for games wouldn’t be complicated. It is now.

“Something that says groups can get together again,” Levin said. “That’s going to have to happen. Nobody knows when that’s going to happen.”

Unlike the NBA, Major League Baseball and NHL, AHL teams can’t rely on media-rights fees to help them avoid substantial losses through a period without games. The Wolves lost three games last weekend and are dropping at least five more home dates at Allstate Arena.

Levin didn’t say how much that hit the Wolves, but he admitted the three games were “a lot of money.”

“I haven’t looked at the economic impact, really, but that’s not really where I’m at right now,” Levin said. “I’m just worried about other people and the situation going on around here.”

For the Wolves, that means anybody who can is working remotely. The players have left, and Levin said AHL teams have been advised they can melt the ice in their buildings. As of Tuesday, however, the Wolves hadn’t.

The Wolves also are processing refunds for people who had bought tickets, but that’s not easy because of the circumstances.

“We’re just in a holding pattern,” Levin said. “We’ve got to get money back to people and groups that bought tickets. There’s a lot of things that have to happen. It’s going to take a little time getting organized. Frankly, we’re short-handed because we don’t want to have everybody working in the same area.”

There is also the business of hockey to attend to. For the Wolves, that means finalizing a new parent club for next year. Levin sounded excited about the future, though he didn’t divulge which teams he had spoken with about a potential partnership.

That, after all, isn’t the priority these days.

“Obviously, these people have other concerns at the moment,” Levin said. “Their NHL teams are down. Their buildings are down. You can’t call them and say, ‘Hey, do you want to talk about this right now?’ I don’t think it’s the most important thing on their minds.

“We’re just going to wait and see. That’s all we can do.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Already 61 games deep into a campaign filled with growing pains and roster instability, the Wolves were set to play three times in three days this weekend. They were scheduled to have two more three-game weekends before the end of the season.

When the Wolves will face those exams is now unknown.

The American Hockey League joined the NHL and other prominent U.S. sports leagues in suspending its season Thursday due to concerns over the coronavirus.

The Wolves had key divisional games against San Antonio (Friday), Rockford (Saturday) and Manitoba, but they have been postponed. The team cited recommendations from Gov. Pritzker and top health officials in announcing all remaining home games will be suspended, in a release that came out before the league itself revealed its decision.

“Governor Pritzker has been working with leading public health experts to determine the best courses of action to prevent the further spread of COVID-19,” Wolves chairman Don Levin said in a statement. “We believe whole-heartedly in Gov. Pritzker’s recommendations and will do everything we can to keep this coronavirus from spreading.”

Counting this weekend, the Wolves had eight home games remaining, including what was supposed to be the April 11 regular-season finale with Manitoba.

”With the health and safety of our players, officials, staff and fans of primary importance, the American Hockey League has announced the suspension of play until further notice, effective immediately, due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic,” the league said in a release. “The AHL will continue to monitor developments and will provide updates on the 2019-20 season at the appropriate time.”

As recently as Wednesday, the Wolves were anticipating playing this weekend. They sent a news release explaining the precautions at Allstate Arena, stressing the Village of Rosemont’s prevention strategies.

But that release was sent before Wednesday’s events, when the NBA postponed its regular season after Utah’s Rudy Gobert was diagnosed with coronavirus. Since then, the NCAA has canceled all of its upcoming tournaments and MLB has announced its regular season will be pushed back, among other sports-related changes.

Thursday’s announcement said the team is working on “procedures to determine the best way to deliver credits and refunds to people who have purchased tickets for these postponed games.”

Zipping past pedestrians during a run or lifting weights at the gym right after someone else are things of the past, with socially distanced running routes and at-home workouts becoming more mainstream.

But if you find yourself with extra time on your hands and the sudden urge to channel your coronavirus anxiety into breaking a sweat, make sure you’re doing so safely. Because, yes, there is such a thing as getting too much exercise. And overdoing it could actually do more harm than good, pandemic or otherwise.

What is the right amount of exercise during the coronavirus crisis?

The standard exercise recommendations are simple: Adults should be getting at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity every week (like brisk walking), and do muscle-strengthening activities two days per week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. You can, of course, mix the moderate physical activity with more vigorous exercise like running.

You might logically assume that more exercise is better because you have more time on your hands, but that’s not really the case. Benefits top out at about 300 minutes per week.

“Whatever your regular exercise routine was, I wouldn’t alter it because of COVID-19 per se,” says Linda S. Pescatello, a kinesiology professor at the University of Connecticut.

Chris Travers, an exercise physiologist at Cleveland Clinic Sports Health, points out that any amount of exercise is better than none. Research shows that even a five-minute walk or run is helping improve your cardiovascular system, and that you can do a total body strength program in seven minutes, he says.

How can I tell if I’m exercising too much?

You can experience a host of symptoms when overexercising. These include:

Loss of appetite

Headache

Muscle soreness and tenderness

Fatigue (not during, but later)

Injury

Higher pulse (10 or more beats) the day after exercising

Irritability

Difficulty concentrating

Reduced self-esteem

Weakened immune system

Beyond roughly 300 minutes of working out, you’re probably not gaining much more benefit anyway, says Robert Sallis, co-director of the Sports Medicine Fellowship at Kaiser Permanente.

The overarching rule is to “listen to your body,” Travers says. It’s OK to skip a day if you’re feeling fatigued.

If you’re feeling severe symptoms such as dizziness, chest pain or fainting, seek medical attention.

Am I more susceptible to the new coronavirus if I exercise too much?

It’s still too soon to make any kind of definitive determination.

Pescatello cautions that while it’s unclear if you could be more susceptible, you wouldn’t want to put yourself in a position of weakening your immune system, given the unknowns.

Though studies aren’t available for COVID-19, we know other viruses are much less likely to affect humans who exercise regularly, Sallis says.

David Nieman, a biology department professor at Appalachian State University, says people shouldn’t even be thinking about overtraining (more than 300 minutes per week) right now.

Existing research data supports the view that overtraining isn’t recommended in parts of the world where COVID-19 transmission risk is high.

“Intense exercise when infected with COVID-19 or other systemic viruses should be avoided,” Nieman says in a review paper coming out in June in the Journal of Sport and Health Science. The U.S. has more than 1 million coronaviruses cases, per Johns Hopkins data.

Now more than ever, though, physical activity is important to strengthen immune function and combat psychological stressors associated with the pandemic.

“Exercise is our best medicine to try to combat those,” Sallis says.

I typically don’t exercise. How can I start safely?

Remember that fitness levels vary person to person. That 150-minute threshold might be too much if you’re starting out, Pescatello says.

Just lacing up your running sneakers won’t turn you into Olympic champion Usain Bolt. In fact, trying a new exercise at a high intensity could prove dangerous.

“You’re not going to improve your physical fitness in a day, but you could hurt yourself in a day,” Travers says. He normally advises patients to walk before they run — literally.

On the flip side: What if your typical exercise routine is gone because of pandemic restrictions? Keep in mind that activities as basic as going for a walk could prove beneficial. Activities like tennis, hiking and bike riding are other socially distanced options to consider for exercise.

You’ll be thankful later. Nieman thinks this epidemic is a wake-up call to the world to reverse trends of obesity and lack of exercise to keep immune systems in solid shape.

“We can do a lot with exercise and leanness to help fend off the virus, or if we get it, to reduce the symptoms and the duration of the symptoms,” Nieman says.

I’ve been training for a race. Should I still run the distance?

You can continue to train for that race you were getting excited about. Alternatively, you can find an event for this fall and start training again.

If you opt to run your distance anyway, see if you can participate in the event virtually if a race is taking that approach. It won’t be the same as you planned, but it’s still a way to achieve that goal.

Remember, though, that running a full marathon can prove a great strain on a body. Nieman recommends people don’t train for a marathon (a 26.2-mile race) until the virus is under control.

So what’s the major takeaway? When it comes to exercise, don’t overdo it, but don’t do nothing. Regular daily exercise gives a boost to immune cells that target viruses when they enter the bloodstream, and exercise will better your mental health, too.

“You don’t really have to do a lot to get these tremendous (exercise) benefits,” Sallis says.

What most of us wouldn’t give for an extended change of scenery right about now.

And now you can, in a way. The “Drive and Listen” app, created by a Turkish graduate student, offers a driver’s view cruising through many of the world’s best-known cities — all while listening to a radio station from that city. Some journeys last a few minutes, others up to an hour.

Perhaps you choose to rumble through Rome, on cobblestone roads with palazzi so close together it feels as dark as night even in the middle of the day. The road widens and you’re in scorching sunlight, with the Colosseum looming in the distance. Or maybe you choose London, where, beneath leaden skies, the city’s famous black taxis zip and dart like shiny beetles along narrow streets.

Or let’s say you have a hankering for home — the way it used to be. You can take a drive along the lakefront as sunset approaches. You pull up to a stoplight just north of Monroe on Lake Shore Drive. Couples with baby strollers and joggers crowd the crosswalk in a time before face masks and social distancing.

Erkam Seker, 24, created the app in April while self-isolating in Munich, Germany, where he is working on a master’s degree in biomedical computing.

“I was so bored at home, and I was missing a ride around my city,” said Seker, speaking Monday via Skype about Istanbul, Turkey. “I used to go out with my friends in a car. Watching the roads as we go is one of the most delicious parts of hanging out.”

He plucked some of the driving videos from YouTube, but as his app gained popularity — he says it’s now received about 3 million views — people sent him videos directly. The app now offers excursions to places as far flung as Melbourne, Australia, and Yekaterinburg, in west-central Russia, where the driver navigates snowy boulevards as street cars, some of which look as though they were built in the Soviet era, rumble alongside the automobiles.

Seker said he typically doesn’t watch the videos from start to finish before posting them. He checks to make sure the video quality is acceptable and that the drivers have chosen interesting streets. Although on one occasion — in Yekaterinburg — the driver navigates, for a time, in an underground parking garage. Fortunately, there’s a fast-forward feature with the app.

And it’s not a total escape. From time to time, a public service announcement cuts in to remind listeners to wear masks and practice good social distancing.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The show traveled to World’s Fairs, on USO tours and to other cultural exchange programs including Chicago lakefront and riverfront festivals.

Chesky said travel will eventually return, but will look different. Airbnb expects travelers will want options that are closer to home and more affordable, for example. The company is scaling back its investments in luxury properties as a result.

Stahl said she was “really scared” after fighting pneumonia caused by the coronavirus for two weeks at home before going to the hospital.

“One of the rules of journalism is ‘don’t become part of the story,’” Stahl said at the end of Sunday’s broadcast. “But instead of covering the pandemic, I was one of the more-than-one-million Americans who did become part of it.”

Stahl, 78, is the dean of correspondents at television’s best-known newsmagazine. She joined “60 Minutes” in March 1991, and before that was moderator of the Sunday talk show “Face the Nation” and a Washington correspondent.

She landed the first television interview with Donald Trump after he was elected president, and the first with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi when she become speaker — both in 2007 and again in 2019.

Stahl said there was a cluster of “60 Minutes” employees with the virus. One “had almost no symptoms while others had almost every symptom you can imagine,” she said. “Each case is different.”

Stahl said she found an overworked and nearly overwhelmed staff when she was hospitalized but paid tribute to their care, and said she was wheeled out through a gauntlet of cheering medical workers when discharged.

“In the face of so much death, they celebrate their triumphs,” she said.

60 Minutes declined to name the hospital involved.

“Thanks to them, like so many other patients, I am well now,” she said. “Tonight, we all owe them our gratitude, our admiration and, in some cases, our lives.”

Stahl is arguably the most prominent television journalist to disclose they had the disease. CNN hosts Chris Cuomo and Brooke Baldwin have tested positive, the former continuing his prime-time show while fighting symptoms.

So with the help of her mom and fellow instructor Melissa Kerpel, the 15-year-old turned their unfinished basement into a fitness studio and has kept offering classes twice a week thanks to a laptop and the internet.

“We’ve had our old familiar faces and some new people from all around the country who have joined us,” said Julia, who’s believed to be one of the youngest instructors in the country licensed to teach Zumba.

Before the pandemic hit, Julia and her mom taught at Highland Park High School and the Lutz Family Center, with many participants coming from Working Together, a non-profit that supports low-income families in Highwood and Highland Park.

Just a few days after their last face-to-face class, the mother-daughter duo decided to give online teaching a try. The class went off without a hitch; participants receive instructions on how to join the class via Zoom.

“Everyone loved it,” Julia said. “We got some positive messages, and we thought, ‘Let’s keep doing it.’”

There have been a few challenges.

Not everyone taking their classes is computer savvy, and some have limited access to the internet. One participant does not have a smart phone, and her only access to a computer is at the public library, which is closed. So the Kerpels gave her a portable DVD player and some Zumba DVDs so she can keep dancing during the stay-at-home order.

Julia is a third-generation Zumba instructor, with both her mom and grandmother, Inez Garber, teaching the Latin-inspired, cardio-dance workout, though Garber isn’t co-teaching with her daughter and granddaughter at the moment because she’s sheltering in place apart from the family.

Julia’s love of Zumba started when she was 3 or 4; that’s when her mom started taking Zumba classes. “She loved it so much that she got certified and would bring me to her classes. I just fell in love with it ... the fun and party atmosphere,” Julia said.

“I love everything about it. Everyone can do it, no matter their dance experience or background. They show up and they have such a great time.”

Julia and her mom have had to dispel some misconceptions about Zumba: “People who are my age think it’s only for their moms and grandmas, which is completely untrue,” Julia said. “And the older generation thinks because they’ve never had any dance experience, they can’t do it.”

After years of doing Zumba — as well as ballet, tap, jazz and modern dance — Julia last year at the age of 14 was certified as a Zumba instructor.

“It’s not super common, but even just this (past) week we had a 17-year-old instructor in the D.C. area who’s been teaching virtual courses,” said Rebecca Dorfman, director of public relations and branded content for the Miami-based Zumba Fitness LLC.

“We do license people who are around her age as long as they have parental consent” and the parent is present while the teen is teaching, Dorfman said.

Kerpel said her daughter teaches under her supervision primarily for insurance purposes. Julia will be able to teach on her own when she turns 18 and plans to teach on her own when she goes to college.

While she declined to say how many licensed instructors are teaching Zumba, Dorfman said thousands of classes are now being offered virtually and more than 1 million people are participating. “Before this, there was no virtual component to Zumba.”

At a time like this, when so many people are under stress, Dorfman said any kind of movement is “super important.”

Deerfield resident Lisa Rosenberg agrees: “The fact that Zumba moved online is an absolute godsend for sanity, for health, for connection.”

Rosenberg, who takes classes from the Kerpels several times a week, said every hour of instruction flies by. And she’s even persuaded her husband to give Zumba a try because he doesn’t have to leave the house. Julia and her mom are “really easy to follow, so upbeat — which is important especially now.”

“She’s such a joy to watch. She always has a big smile on her face,” Rosenberg said of the teen instructor, who she jokes is helping Rosenberg keep off “the COVID 19” stay-at-home pounds, a reference to the “freshman 15” weight gain many college students experience during their first year away from home.

“Everyone morning I get up with them and I do the workout. And it helps me,” Rosenberg said.

Though they plan to keep offering some virtual classes once in-person instruction can resume, the mother-daughter duo looks forward to being back in the same room with their participants, who range in age from young children to grandmas.

“We miss being with each other and the joy and energy we create when we are dancing together,” Melissa Kerpel said.

“Took a test the other day. And I found out that I have the antibodies,” the singer, 61, said in her latest Madame X-themed “Quarantine Diary” on Instagram Thursday.

“So tomorrow,” Madonna added, “I’m just going to go for a long drive in a car, and I’m going to roll down the window, and I’m going to breathe in, I’m going to breathe in the COVID-19 air. Yup. I hope the sun is shining.”

Antibody tests check antibodies in your blood to see if you were previously exposed to the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The federal agency says “a positive test result shows you have antibodies that likely resulted from an infection with SARS-CoV-2,” the virus that causes COVID-19.

Although Madonna may be ready to hit the road following her positive antibody test results, the CDC says it’s unclear if the antibodies will make you immune to the virus or prevent you from getting infected again.

Madonna captioned her quarantine diary with the hashtags #staysafe #staysane

“Here’s the good news,” she added on Instagram. “Tomorrow’s another day and I’m going to wake up and I’m going to feel differently.”

Last month, Madonna stirred controversy after calling the coronavirus ”the great equalizer.”

“That’s the thing about COVID-19,” she said “It doesn’t care about how rich you are, how famous you are, how funny you are, how smart you are, where you live, how old you are, what amazing stories you can tell. It’s the great equalizer.”

According to the singer, “what’s terrible” about the virus is also “what’s great about it.”

Like many artists in the entertainment industry, Madonna canceled the remainder of her tour, “Madame X,” over safety concerns last month.

The large-scale public gesture is an homage to Mayor Lightfoot’s rallying cry earlier this month promoting her “Chicago Together! Make a Mask, Give a Mask, Wear a Mask” initiative. The mayor is asking residents to make/donate homemade cloth masks for first responders and Chicago’s homeless/shelter populations. A cloth-masked Lightfoot herself is pictured on the video screens at the Crown Fountain in Millennium Park.

In Daley Plaza, the equally iconic Picasso statue is also sporting a mask. The massive coverings for the lions and the Picasso feature a Chicago flag and were created by Dimension Design in Glenview.

According to a statement from the Art Institute, the materials used in the creation of the masks did not in any way impact those needed to produce PPE supplies for first responders and frontline workers.

The masks, made from a printable synthetic material, were designed by Kelly Winter of Dimension Design, and took several days from plan to completion, said the company’s co-founder Jeremy Biewer. A team of 10 employees worked on the project — from graphic design, to fabric engineering, to printing, cutting and sewing.

“The fabric can hold up pretty well in Chicago weather,” Biewer said. But if there’s any [wear and tear] in the coming weeks, he said they can “produce replacements in a matter of hours if necessary.”

Biewer said his company generally works trade shows and large-scale events, but has reconfigured to create masks for first responders and frontline workers during the pandemic. To date, they’ve donated 3,000 masks to local facilities.

The lion masks were made for a “very modest three-figure charge for material and labor,” said Jim Winter, executive vice-president of Dimension Design, while the mask adorning the Picasso statue was “donation from the company to the city and people of Chicago.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

For allergy sufferers, a season of worry",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kJAQ3his_vaRWCG2rM4P3AMO5LI=/0x0:3000x1571/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19859012/1215752369.jpg.jpg,"HAMBURG, Pa. — The spring breezes of 2020 are carrying more than just tree pollen. There’s a whiff of paranoia in the air.

For millions of seasonal allergy sufferers, the annual onset of watery eyes and scratchy throats is bumping up against the global spread of a new virus that produces its own constellation of respiratory symptoms.

With coronavirus restrictions in place, interactions with nature might be limited to a quick walk through the neighborhood, but it’s not hard to notice spring has sprung — bringing allergy season with it.

Allergy symptoms are likely to increase during the next two to three weeks as pollen counts grow into the thousands, said Leonard Bielory, professor of medicine, allergy, immunology and ophthalmology at Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine.

“If it wasn’t for the cold snap, we’d be having an incredible amount of pollen right now,” Bielory said Monday. “Once it warms up, with the rain we’ve gotten, it’s going to be quite an intense opening season for trees. It’s going to explode.”

That’s causing angst for people who never have had to particularly worry about their hay fever, other than to stock up on antihistamines, decongestants and tissues. Now they’re asking: Are these my allergies? Or something more sinister?

“Everyone is sort of analyzing every sneeze and cough right now,” said Kathy Przywara, who manages an online community of allergy sufferers for the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.

Never mind the differing symptoms — that sneezing and runny nose, hallmarks of hay fever, are not typically associated with COVID-19, which commonly produces coughing, fever and in more serious cases shortness of breath. Never mind that allergies don’t cause fevers. Allergy sufferers fret that there’s just enough overlap to make them nervous.

Patients with asthma or allergies who cough and experience breathlessness can resolve their symptoms with inhalers or prescription medication.

But if a patient has COVID-19, those solutions won’t work.

Many garden-variety hay fever sufferers, of whom there are about 19 million adults in the U.S., are also on heightened alert.

They’re taking their temperatures each day, just in case. They’re hiding their sneezes and sniffles from suspicious colleagues and grossed-out grocery shoppers. They’re commiserating with each other and sharing memes on social media (“I don’t know if I should buy Zyrtec or turn myself in to the CDC”).

Pamela Smelser is reminded of allergy season every time she looks out the window of her home office, where her cherry tree is blooming. Spring came early to Maryland, she said, and lots of people are coughing and sneezing from the pollen.

“You do what you have to do: You take your meds for allergies and stay away from people,” Smelser said. “People get really hinky about coughing right now.”

Though she’s had allergies for years, Smelser, a semi-retired social worker and community college teacher outside Baltimore, admits to being a touch paranoid. She takes her temperature every day because she’s 66 and, well, you can never be too careful.

“I can’t rule out that I have anything,” she said. “That’s the paranoia: You can’t even get a test to say, ‘This is all seasonal allergies.’”

In Pennsylvania, pear trees are budding, red maple are beginning to flower and Leslie Haerer’s allergies are already in full bloom. The 64-year-old retired nurse, who lives about an hour north of Philadelphia, is coping with a scratchy throat, an urge to sneeze and a headache behind the eyes.

As a medical professional, Haerer knows her symptoms are attributable to her allergies. She also knows that other people are “really flipped out about this,” including the scowling family of three who saw her sneeze into her elbow outside a Chinese restaurant and, instead of continuing on to their destination — the pizza shop next door — got in their car and sped away.

“I was like, ‘I’m sorry you missed your pizza,’” Haerer said. “People’s reactions are just over the top.”

In Austin, Texas, where pollen counts are high, Marty Watson initially dismissed his itchy eyes, mild headache, coughing and sneezing as the product of a tree allergy, even after his temperature became slightly elevated. Then, in mid-March, he realized he could no longer smell a pungent sourdough starter, and friends began sending him news stories that said a loss of smell sometimes accompanied a coronavirus infection.

”Austin is notorious for all sorts of allergies, and it became really hard to tell: Is it this? Is it that?” said Watson, 52.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up in a couple weeks. Older adults and people with existing health problems are at higher risk of more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.

As allergy season ramps up in Pennsylvania, Dr. Laura Fisher, an allergist in Lancaster, expects an influx of worried patients. She is advising them to keep up with their medications, stay at home as much as possible and monitor for symptoms that seem unrelated to their allergies.

“I think people are more afraid of catching it, more afraid of going out and getting it from the grocery store or drive-thru, than they are of their usual symptoms being COVID,” said Fisher, president of the Pennsylvania Allergy and Asthma Association.

Jessica Tanniehill initially blew off her symptoms as allergy-related.

Tanniehill, 39, of Adamsville, Alabama, started with a runny nose and sneezing. Body aches and a cough came next, following by shortness of breath. She thought her seasonal allergies had led to a bout of anxiety, nothing more, especially since she’d been outside all day doing yard work and washing her truck. “I didn’t take it seriously,” she said.

Turns out she’d contracted COVID-19 — which doesn’t preclude the possibility that she’d had allergies as well.

Tanniehill, who’s now on the mend, acknowledged that she “was one of the people that was saying they’re overreacting to all this. But now I wish I was more careful.”

“They’re really good results,” Dr. Richard Novak, chief of infectious disease at UIC, told the Sun-Times Wednesday of the drug made by Gilead Sciences, called remdesivir.

He added: “That’s great and should give some people a sense of relief who are concerned about getting sick.”

Remdesivir is the first drug to show such promising results against the virus, which has killed more than 218,000 people since it emerged late last year in China. Having a treatment could have a profound effect on the global pandemic, especially because health officials say any vaccine is likely a year or more away.

Get the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.

The study, run by the National Institutes of Health, tested remdesivir versus the usual care given in 1,063 hospitalized coronavirus patients around the world. At the White House, NIH’s Dr. Anthony Fauci said the drug reduced the time it takes patients to recover by 31% — 11 days on average versus 15 days for those just given usual care.

Can block virus

He also said there was a trend toward fewer deaths among those on remdesivir, and that full results would soon be published in a medical journal.

“What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus,” Fauci said. “This will be the standard of care.”

A statement from the Food and Drug Administration says that the agency has been talking with California-based Gilead “regarding making remdesivir available to patients as quickly as possible, as appropriate.”

The drug is given through an IV and is designed to interfere with the virus’s ability to copy its genetic material. In animal tests against SARS and MERS, diseases caused by similar coronaviruses, the drug helped prevent infection and reduced the severity of symptoms when given early enough in the course of illness. But it is not yet approved anywhere in the world for any use.

Only hospitalized patients can use

Because the drug is given through an IV, only patients who are hospitalized will be able to receive it for the time being, Novak said.

“It’s going to be challenging to give in an outpatient setting,” Novak said.

The drug will also continue to be tested with other drugs to see if a combination of treatments will produce more positive outcomes, he said.

“We’re not done yet. We still need to find more and better treatments,” Novak said.

A less encouraging picture came from partial results from a separate study testing remdesivir in severely ill patients in China, published Wednesday in the British medical journal Lancet. Treatment did not speed recovery in that study, which was stopped after only 237 of a planned 453 patients were enrolled.

2nd study shows improvements

Separately on Wednesday, Gilead announced partial results from its own ongoing study of the drug in severely ill, hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The company said of patients who were treated with remdesivir within five days of an onset of symptoms, 65% achieved clinical recovery and 60% were discharged.

However, the results are difficult to interpret because there is no comparison group of people getting usual care, so it’s impossible to know how much patients would have improved on their own.

Stroger Hospital, which is taking part in the trial, has seen results that are “similar and consistent” with the overall results released by Gilead so far, said Dr. Gregory Huhn, an infectious disease physician for Cook County Health and principal site investigator for the trial here.

Huhn, however, said it will take more than a single drug to beat back this novel coronavirus.

“We need multiple strategies to defeat COVID-19,” Huhn said. “I think this drug ... in combination with a future vaccine, [could] provide a multi-pronged attack on COVID-19. So, I really think that an effective therapeutic along with effective prevention is going to get us to the other side of this pandemic.”

Stroger is also taking part in a trial examining more moderate COVID-19 cases. No results have yet been announced from that second study, which does have a comparison group getting usual care. The company said no new safety problems emerged in that study, and that it would publish results in a medical journal soon.

Other drugs researched

In other treatment-related news this week, two studies gave updates on anti-inflammatory drugs that aim to tamp down the severe inflammation that often develops in later stages of severe COVID-19 and often proves fatal.

A French hospital consortium reported success with using Acetemra, a Roche drug sold for rheumatoid arthritis and some other conditions, in a study of 129 coronavirus patients where 65 got the drug and the rest, usual care. No details were released; doctors said they were preparing to publish results.

A similar drug, Kevzara, did not work as well at low doses in a study of severely ill coronavirus patients, its makers Sanofi and Regeneron said. They’re continuing to test it at higher doses in critically ill patients, though.

Social distancing still needed

Novak said that the success of treating patients with remdesivir doesn’t mean that its use will necessarily have a significant impact on the need to continue social distancing.

“People are still dying from COVID-19, even with treatment from remdesivir,” Novak said. “The biggest concern has been [sick patients] overwhelming our hospitals with the number of cases. This won’t change that. We still need to be reducing the number of new cases.”

The order will use the Defense Production Act to classify meat processing as critical infrastructure to keep production plants open.

Get the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.

The order comes after industry leaders warned that consumers could see meat shortages in a matter of days after workers at major facilities tested positive for the virus. A senior White House official said the administration was working to prevent a situation in which a majority of processing plants shut down for a period of time, which could lead to an 80% drop in the availability of meat in supermarkets. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the order before its release.

Trump on Tuesday told reporters that “there’s plenty of supply,” but that supply chains had hit what he called a “road block. It’s sort of a legal roadblock more than anything else,” he said.

Two of the nation’s biggest pork processing plants are currently closed. Meat processing giant Tyson Foods suspended operations at its plant in Waterloo, Iowa. And Smithfield Foods halted production at its plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The 15 largest pork-packing plants account for 60% of all pork processed in the country.

GOP Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota had written a letter to Trump asking him to use the DPA to declare the food supply industry an essential industry, warning that consumers would see a meat shortage in a matter of days akin to the panic over toilet paper the virus created in its early days.

Tyson ran a full-page advertisement in The New York Times and other newspapers Sunday outlining the difficulty of producing meat while keeping more than 100,000 workers safe and shutting some plants.

“As pork, beef and chicken plants are being forced to close, even for short periods of time, millions of pounds of meat will disappear from the supply chain,” it read.

The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents 1.3 million food and retail workers, said Tuesday that 20 U.S. food-processing and meatpacking union workers in the U.S. have died and that an estimated 6,500 are sick or have been exposed to the virus while working near someone who tested positive.

COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, has infected hundreds of workers at meat-processing plants and forced some of the largest to close and others to slow production. While the output at beef and poultry plants has diminished, pork plants in the Midwest have been hit especially hard. The viral outbreaks have persisted despite efforts by the meat companies to keep workers at home with pay if they become sick.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The people behind a running boom in Chicago are grabbing what they have in their closets and heading out the door to burn calories and stress. Or at least that’s what appears to be happening.

“This is anecdotal, there’s no data to support it, but it’s being observed, just the number of people you see running. It’s a visible change, and it’s being discussed by the entire running industry,” Chicago Area Running Association Executive Director Greg Hipp said Thursday.

Normal indicators, like a bump in race registrations (they’re off or on hold) or shoe sales (they’re down) aren’t accounting for the bump.

It makes perfect sense, though.

“When the economy is challenged, more people run because it’s affordable. People who can’t go to the local gym have taken up running,” Hipp said.

“They’re not running for sport, it’s for mental and physical health,” Hipp said.

“The running industry is in crisis. It will be interesting to see how many of these new runners will fall in love and turn to the sport side of it.”

Manya Gupta, 38, of Logan Square, is part of the new wave of runners.

The Rush University Medical Center physician held this belief for a long time: “I’m not a runner. I hate running.” But the stress of treating coronavirus patients became too much, and she needed a way to cope, so she laced up.

“I decided to go for a run one day last month and it felt really good. It was crazy, I just ran one mile, but I felt like I relieved a load of stress,” she said.

“I always discounted the stress-relieving effects of running, mostly because I just assumed I hated it so much. But I have to say it really does work, and it’s free.”

Dave Zimmer, owner of Fleet Feet Chicago, is keeping a close eye on the trend.

“We want to bring these people into the fold because we believe it will be great for us and them in the long run,” said Zimmer, noting injury prevention and reduction are Fleet Feet’s main goals.

Sales have gone down significantly since the state’s stay-at-home order kicked in last month, Zimmer said. His seven stores have pivoted to virtual shoe fittings, online sales and curbside pickup.

“The clearance section of our website is being shopped quite a bit these days, and those items are just as good, but may be from last season and present the best value in these challenging times.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

A century later, home gardeners are returning to that idea in the fight against a global pandemic.

Backyard gardeners are coming together, mostly virtually, to learn and share stories on how to grow vegetables, fruits and flowers as the novel coronavirus raises fears about disruptions in food supplies and the cost of food in a down economy.

Creating a victory garden now can be, as it was during World Wars I and II, a shared experience during hardship and uncertainty.

“World War I, to me, is a pretty stark parallel,” said Rose Hayden-Smith, a historian and author of “Sowing the Seeds of Victory: American Gardening Programs of World War I.” “Not only was there a war, but there was an influenza pandemic.”

Now, gardeners new and old are getting online and on social media to post pictures of freshly tilled backyards, raised garden beds, seeds germinating under grow lights or flocks of chickens. Facebook groups like Victory Garden 2020 or Victory Garden Over COVID-19 are filling up.

Some of these gardeners are newly unemployed, or working parents stuck at home with bored kids. Others are gardening enthusiasts who never had the time before to delve deep into the hobby. Urban community gardeners are ramping up production to feed families who have lost income and kids who no longer get meals at school.

Jennifer McShane had to close her bar in Brooklyn due to the COVID-19 spread in New York City. She’s been eating mostly frozen vegetables and is wary of buying fresh produce from a grocery store. But she knew how to plant herbs in containers on her brownstone’s patio, so she picked up some tomato seeds, sowed them indoors and labeled them “Seeds of Hope.”

“I can’t wait for the plants to come in because I am desperate,” said McShane. “The things I am missing are the fresh things.”

Emanuel Sferios of Las Cruces, New Mexico, was a self-employed contract worker before the virus, but his work has dried up.

So he borrowed a tiller from a neighbor and dug a 30-by-30-foot garden in his backyard. He filled it with compost and planted lettuce, beets, kale and broccoli. He plans to grow squash, melons, tomatoes and peppers, too. He and his girlfriend found a friend on Facebook who was giving out seedlings.

“It’s not like we needed this in order to get groceries,” said Sferios. “It’s more like, wow, what do I do now? I don’t have work and I have all this time on my hands.”

A common reason to grow vegetables during WWI was limited food supply. America was sending food to European allies and American troops, explained Hayden-Smith. Victory gardens also were a way to assimilate America’s many new immigrants through a patriotic and community-building effort.

“So these gardening posters and food preservation posters would appear in literally dozens of languages,” said Hayden-Smith.

By WWII, the federal government started encouraging gardening as good economics after the Depression. And as it looked for healthy young men to draft, the government promoted nutrition as part of the national defense, Hayden-Smith said.

Hayden-Smith sees social-media posts about gardening during the pandemic as a 21st century version of the victory garden poster.

“We don’t have poster art, but we have Instagram,” she said.

In Chicago, a nonprofit called Urban Growers Collective teaches kids and others to grow vegetables at eight urban farms around the city. While their spring educational programs are on hold due to rules on social distancing, co-founder Laurell Sims said they are still focusing on food production and getting produce to families that need it. The group is selling bags of homegrown vegetables like kale, spinach and scallions.

“We’re starting to see prices spike here in Chicago for certain kinds of produce just because it’s harder to get it,” Sims said.

She said most community gardens right now are closed, but her group is hoping to get them reopened with limits on the number of people allowed to work in them at one time.

“The whole heart of a community garden is a community,” said Sims. “When we know that our neighbors are sick, when we know our neighbors are compromised, we’re able to help them out.”

Gardening skills were once passed on from generation to generation, but farming became more industrialized and people moved away from rural areas. Now there’s nostalgia for a connection to the land, including gardening, preserving and cooking at home.

Across the country, stores are selling out of flowers, vegetable plants, seeds, and garden soil and compost. At Burpee Seeds, an online, catalog and retail supplier, business has doubled during the pandemic. George Ball, chairman of Burpee, said this cyclical interest in gardening is tied to the national economy.

“We do really well when the economy is stressed or sort of knocked sideways,” Ball said, adding that Burpee also saw an uptick in seed purchases during the Great Recession and the stock market crash in 1987.

Brenda Flowers, in Crystal River, Florida, built a tall raised garden for her 96-year-old mother, Lorraine, who grew up in the Great Depression and was among the many women who went to work in factories during World War II to replace the men who were fighting overseas.

“Wouldn’t that be so cool if she could go out and just rip off some lettuce leaves and pull up some radishes and some carrots and kale, just like she did when she was younger?” said Flowers.

Before the coronovirus, Bettie Egerton wanted to revive victory gardens in her community of McMinnville, Oregon, to address climate change. She handed out victory garden signs for people to put in their gardens, and encouraged people to avoid buying produce that was trucked in from thousands of miles away. Now, Egerton says the idea of a victory garden has added resonance.

“It’s like victory over all kinds of things,” she said.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Then life changed in an instant.

The coronavirus pandemic prompted a statewide stay-at-home order, forcing adjustments to their out-of-the-house routines.

Lee-Ann Millas’ boys, 5 and 9, who have been practicing martial arts for the last six months at a studio in Evergreen Park, haven’t missed a beat. The switch to virtual tae kwon do training has “been a blessing.”

“It’s the only normalcy they’ve been able to have besides being at home,” Millas said.

Grandmaster Kwan Pil Kim teaches tae kwon do and hapkido in Evergreen Park. His classes are usually filled with students ranging in age from 4 to 76, but now he’s forced to perform his techniques in front of a laptop.

“At the beginning, I had a hard time because it was the first time using,” Kim said. “But after a couple of days, it was easier to join for everybody.”

He first started teaching his classes March 14 via Zoom and quickly noticed an issue with teaching martial arts techniques through a camera.

“I was confused in the beginning because [the video] is mirroring, so when I use my left hand they are using their right hand,” Kim said.

Despite the early kinks, classes have gone smoothly since the early days of the experiment, he said.

He teaches every day, following his regular class schedule. He’s even figured out a way for parents to make up for the lack of training equipment.

“I showed them how to make a kicking paddle with a plastic bag,” Kim said. “Put some air in [the bag] and tie it. That was fun.”

His biggest issue now is making sure his youngest students stay focused throughout the session.

“I have to keep them focused because everyone is at home and just looking at the screen,” Kim said.

Millas said the virtual training gives her sons “something to look forward to every day.”

“I think it’s a wonderful thing that not only is he doing for a community, but for the sanity of the kids and parents,” she said.

Kim said the online-only experience has been eye-opening for him, and he didn’t realize how easy it would be to get used to.

“It’s really cool, and especially right now it’s the only thing we can do. We have to teach new stuff, but it’s fun,” Kim said.

Rebecca Caliendo, a yoga instructor, is also holding virtual classes. She believes staying active is as beneficial for mental health as it is for physical health, especially for those who feel bombarded by coronavirus news.

“It’s not bad to feel anxiety or fear … but that has to go somewhere,” Caliendo said. “You need to let them out somehow and doing anything; walking, jumping jacks, yoga. I think that helps people.”

Caliendo started practicing yoga when she lived in New York and she sang opera for a living.

“It’s a crazy place to be. And I needed to discharge, I needed a mental health release,” she said. “I started practicing yoga, which I say kind of saved my sanity, saved my life.”

Before the statewide measure was put into place, Caliendo was holding classes in studios and gyms. She decided to take a stab at doing it online because she missed teaching and realized people were looking for their own way to discharge.

“It’s really cool because it’s physical. But then you also get to chill and relax at the end,” she said.

Caliendo’s classes are free, but she does accept donations.

She teaches all levels five days a week, with her largest class to date at 25 participants. A recent class featured a woman in her 70s who was trying yoga for the first time.

Caliendo said the meditative aspects of a yoga routine are especially helpful right now because instructors can’t adjust their students’ bodies into the right positions.

For fitness instructor Mary Younger, quarantine life has presented an opportunity for her to branch out into the digital space, a move she put off for too long.

“I’ve had a lot of people over the years ask me if I have a tape that I could sell or a DVD,” she said. “This coronavirus era has forced me to do what people have been asking me to do in the first place.”

A couple of days before the stay-at-home order was announced, Younger experimented with her first couple of streams.

“I did a 30-minute step aerobics class and did a 30-minute cardio kickboxing class. The feedback was awesome. I mean, it was great.”

Encouraged by the responses, Younger increased her online workouts. Now she streams her routines three times a week on Facebook live.

The frustrating part, she says, is not being able to feed off of the energy of her students or motivate those who need a little encouragement during a workout.

But the benefits of staying active when you’re cooped up inside outweigh any inconveniences, Younger said.

“I don’t care how wonderful your apartment or your house is with a great balcony and backyard,” she said. “Staying fit is a positive distraction. With all this going on, it makes you feel good about yourself to take care of yourself.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Lala, she thought, would be company. But she’s turned out to be so much more.

“Being alone at home kind of is hard,” says George, “but with a pet you have someone to take care of, someone to play with you, someone to greet you in the morning, so it’s kind of like really calming and comforting.”

Whether it’s a dog, a cat or, yes, a hedgehog named Quillie Nelson, pets are proving to be unexpected heroes in lockdown. They include the newly adopted and fostered like Lala; people have flooded shelters, looking for pets to fill their extra hours at home.

Laura Evans, her husband and their three kids brought 12-week-old Zoe to their Bethesda, Maryland, home after the pandemic hit. The squirmy Yorkshire terrier needs constant attention, and they’re happy to oblige.

“We wanted to bring a little light and life to our house,” Evans said. “She’s a cuddly work, homework sidekick. Everyone wants to hang with her.”

Nancy Karan said her pet Shadow gets her out of her New York apartment for quality time with her fellow dog walkers, at a safe distance. At night they sleep together, “because it’s very comforting just to have his body on my bed.”

In Houston, Quillie Nelson and other pets help maintain routines for Rachael Pavlik and two teens.

“I think having pets during a scary time like this is good for the whole family. It’s good for the kids to have a sense of normalcy and a sense of responsibility, like they have to get out of bed before noon to feed their animals,” she said.

Kitty Block, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, urged more people to foster and adopt as the health crisis worsens.

“It frees up space in the shelter to take these animals in that may be displaced because their family member, their owner is ill or financially in a troubled situation,” she said.

While many people seek comfort, some frustrations have surfaced with all the togetherness. Professional dog trainer Nicole Ellis in Los Angeles, of the service Rover.com, said owners should make a conscious effort to tire out their animals before a Zoom meeting or important phone call.

“We can’t blame them if they’re like, ‘I’m bored! I’m bored!’ and they haven’t done anything all day. It’s not their fault,” she said.

That doesn’t seem to be a problem for Squiggles, a bearded dragon in South Orange, New Jersey. Dan Cohen’s 13-year-old daughter, Julia, has survived with help from her chill lizard, who has her own emotional support vest and tiny mask.

“We don’t want her catching coronavirus,” he joked.

Aubrey Fine, a licensed psychologist and professor emeritus at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona said the relationship is mutually beneficial between humans and animals.

“In a time of tremendous and unique life challenges, goodness is still around us. When you’re looking at souls, animals touch human souls and humans touch animal souls. And together serendipity can happen.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Forget that. Now it’s all about coronavirus.

Just what we need: A new source of family division as we clash over how to properly respond to a killer pandemic when millions of American families are shut in for maybe months and already getting on each other’s nerves.

Your spouse thinks it’s safe to eat with friends on the patio; you think it should be home-cooked meals with family only. But the kids want to go to the lake house and get takeout every day. You drop off groceries for the grandparents, while they keep going to Costco just because they’re bored. And they’re pressing to see the kids, never mind social distancing.

By now, you may be fighting over who gets to walk the dog just so you can get the heck out of Dodge.

Brandi Cypher, a Seattle mother of two boys, is managing lockdown with her ex-husband who lives in a different house. Both are working from home, and communicate amicably by text and phone.

“I did not agree that his parents should come in to town, with Seattle being the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak at the time,” she says. “He did not think that I should have my friend, who also cuts my hair, come to my house even though she had been in quarantine for several weeks. These are new kinds of disagreements that have come up with coronavirus, and do cause some tension.”

Many of us might be thinking we need a family therapist about now. In fact, sociologists, psychologists, therapists and relationship trainers say they are already hearing from clients and patients, even though no one is actually seeing them in person (it’s taking place by phone or online via video links).

“They won’t apply the words, ‘it’s because of the virus or the pandemic that I’m feeling this way,’ “ says Mandy Mitchell, a licensed clinical social worker at the Center for Counseling and Wellness in Myrtle Beach, S.C. ”Instead, they say, ‘I wanted him to buy seven cans of corn and he only bought three’ and they think they’re arguing about corn when what they’re really arguing about is the need to feel secure and stable.”

All families have underlying issues; in times like these, they’re exacerbated or easily triggered, thus launching potentially toxic interactions, says family therapist Helen Park of Manhattan’s Ackerman Institute for the Family, a mental-health clinic.

“It’s just so much more pronounced now because the climate for everybody is such an acute, pervasive level of anxiety,” Park says. “That kicks up the sympathetic nervous system; the fight-or-flight fear responses are very much always on. That’s where you get problematic cycles of interactions, which are so difficult to interrupt if you’re in a heightened state.”

Indeed, American households are dealing with a whole new level of fraught these days, one that makes the usual squabbling seem tame.

Elizabeth Tenety, a co-founder of and occasional columnist on the popular parenting site Motherly.com, says she’s noticed how virus lockdown is affecting her own family; she and her husband are the parents of four kids under 7, and both are working from their New Jersey home.

“A week or two ago, I just attacked my husband — I had what I now understand, after a lot of reporting and writing about it, was a natural human reaction to so much uncertainty and terror,” says Tenety, co-author of “The Motherly Guide to Becoming Mama.”

“I’m trying to cope with demands, he’s not coping the way I want him to be coping, and I handled it in the worst way, very accusatory,” Tenety says. “We’re hearing from our audience there are thousands of women saying ‘me, too, I’m fighting with my partner’ more.”

Stacey Engle, president of Fierce Conversations, a Seattle-based corporate training and coaching firm (based on a self-help book of the same name), says her company trains people on how to have “better conversations” aimed at listening and communicating with less rancor. Now that they’re delivering their training online to couples and families, they’re advising clients that existing tensions can be resolved or ameliorated before relationships become irreparable, Engle says.

“Because a core idea is that the conversation IS the relationship,” Engle says. “If you want an open, loving relationship, you need to have the same in conversations.”

Teaching people “the skill of listening to understand rather than to form your rebuttal” is the aim of the Seattle-based Gottman Institute, which preaches a research-based approach to relationships and trains certified therapists like Mitchell. She says she’s seeing an increase in conflict among her clients they hadn’t experienced since they started therapy.

”It might look like anger but it’s really just fear, because that’s a very primal part of us as human beings,” she says. She tries to help people learn to dial down accusatory and aggressive interactions. “How do you approach any subject in a way that is gentle and kind and shows what we call unconditional positive regard, meaning: I love you no matter what.”

Even in the best of times, it takes work to consciously de-escalate tensions or remember to just check in regularly with each other, says Tenety. She and her husband have arranged an ad hoc shift system to give each time off from dealing with kids, school, household chores and work during quarantine.

“We’re hearing this a lot from the parenting community, about being as empathetic and generous with your partner as you would want him or her to be with you,” says Tenety. “I’m so fried at the end of the day, I am going to bed early but my husband is staying up and working on his garden, so I give him the space he needs to cope, and I get the space I need to sleep.”

Tziporah Rosenberg, an associate professor in the Departments of Psychiatry & Family Medicine at the University of Rochester medical school.

“If they avoided hard conversations or fought over every difference before, you can reasonably expect that’s how they’re handling things now,” Rosenberg says. “For most people, it’s not the time to hatch brand new skills.”

And it does take skills to cope when the anxiety meter is soaring because of fear.

“When we’re fearful we’re not operating at our best,” Rosenberg says. “We’re operating out of survival instincts and there’s not a lot of room for empathy, compassion, patience, listening deeply — those are higher-level skills.”

So what can be done? It’s not like you can flounce out of the house in a huff.

Engle suggests taking a straightforward approach: Address and talk about whatever needs to be talked about in a non-confrontational way.

“If there are issues occurring or bothering you, you have to name it, get clear about it and why is this an issue, and get more clarity to prepare to have a conversation with whoever is involved,” Engle says. “You’re addressing issues with a person alongside a person, it’s not confronting a person.”

In the midst of an argument, remember to hit the “pause” button, says Rosenberg.

“We’ve recommended this for years, (that) when couples get into arguments, blow the whistle and take a time out,” she says. “Go to mutual corners and revisit the conversation a half-hour later. It takes our brains at least that long to come down from agitation.”

That time-tested technique is even more relevant now, says Engle. “In this time, you have the opportunity more than ever to pause, reflect and connect with the people you live with in new and meaningful ways,” she says.

Try self-soothing and self-care techniques. Take a yoga class online or learn to meditate via an online course. Look for a celebrity workout routine on Instagram and try it. (Check out Jane Fonda’s on TikTok.) Lose yourself in a book, work in the garden or even take a nap.

Kirsten Ngheim, who lives with her husband and two young sons on Bainbridge Island, Wash., says so far she and her husband are in harmony about their lives in lockdown, and maybe it’s because she’s focused on her garden in trying to prepare for the unknown.

“I’m thinking more about planting foods that grow plentifully, further reducing the need for store runs,” she says. “But I’m also planting lots of flowers, which evoke an appreciation for nature, happiness, and love just by seeing them. Creating joy in beauty (and) inspiring mental health.”

Another thing to remember is that a therapist is only a video link away. “One of the great things is that there are all these resources for self-care so readily accessible online,” Park says. “Normally these workshops or retreats, you have to show up in person and pay a lot of money. Now they’re free online.”

Cypher says she tries to focus on the positive aspects of her situation in Seattle. Not being in the same house with her ex makes things easier, she says.

“We don’t have constant exposure to one another so in that sense we aren’t getting on each other’s nerves the way some folks who share a home probably are,” she notes. “As this continues, I’m sure other issues will come up but fortunately thus far, it’s been relatively smooth.”

It might help to remember that millions of families are struggling to cope, too. You can tell because people are talking about it online and on social media. Or joking about it.

“Thank God, my wife has multiple personalities. I’m quarantined with a different person everyday and its not boring at all,” joshed Paul Barbar.

“Is this a tension headache caused by my friends and family still not taking this pandemic seriously, or am I just coming down with the novel coronavirus: a fun, daily question!” tweeted Tiffany C. Li, an attorney and legal scholar.

Even America’s celebrity sweethearts want to throttle each other. Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard, married since 2013 and parents of two young daughters, openly admitted it in a video interview with Katie Couric last month.

As the lovey-dovey couple sat next to each for the video, the tension was obvious on camera.

“This is as physically close as we’ve been in a couple of days ‘cause we’ve just found each other revolting,” Bell said, sharing they had been “at each other’s throats real bad.”

So what does it feel like to undergo one of the not-yet-widely-available nasal swab tests for COVID-19?

With testing still limited, we can’t offer a firsthand report. But Dr. Jayant Pinto can.

“It’s not comfortable, I’ll just be honest,” says Pinto, a University of Chicago Medicine otolaryngologist who’s had similar tests done on himself. “There’s a little discomfort. It’s not long-lasting. It’ll sting for a minute.”

It isn’t pain like you feel from a shot. Instead, think about how it felt if you’ve gotten chlorinated water up your nose in a swimming pool.

The complex nerve endings in your nose told your brain: That’s not right, there’s something bad in there. And that burning sensation makes you want to blow the water right back out.

Well, the swab test for COVID-19 is more intense than that.

“It’s a deep burning, and it often elicits tears and sometimes coughing,” says Molly K. Erickson, a nurse practitioner at Rush University Medical Center who helped set up the Chicago hospital’s testing sites. “That discomfort really comes with getting an adequate sample.”

So, if you didn’t feel anything, it means the test probably wasn’t done right.

There are several types of coronavirus tests. All involve collecting a sample using a swab.

That’s followed by molecular analysis to look for the presence of the virus’ genetic material.

Blood tests, in contrast, look for a person’s antibodies to a virus, which show past exposure and possibly future immunity. So far, one blood test for coronavirus has been approved by the U.S. government. Others are under development.

Most swab tests aim for the virus’ preferred hiding spots in the nasopharynx, located about seven centimeters straight back into the nose, or in the turbinate area, about 2.5 centimeters inside the nose.

The person administering the test will wear PPE — personal protective equipment — including a mask, face shield and gown, to protect against possible exposure from your breath or a sudden sneeze or any airborne particles that get stirred up.

Once the swab is inserted, it needs to be swirled around for about 15 seconds. Depending on the test, the same thing might also be done through your other nostril.

The discomfort you feel typically goes away quickly, and there’s usually no bleeding.

President Donald Trump, who’s been tested at least twice, described it as “not something I want to do every day, I can tell you that.”

U.S. testing got a boost late last month when Abbott Laboratories, based in Lake County, was given expedited approval by the federal Food and Drug Administration to roll out its new rapid COVID-19 test. It uses a portable machine about the size of a toaster to provide results quickly — as quickly as five minutes for a positive result and 13 minutes for a negative result.

The White House was one of the first locations to get the Abbott tests. Since the beginning of April, guests visiting Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have been required to get a test even if they feel healthy, the Washington Post reported.

Most other people will have to wait a bit longer. Chicago-area facilities using the new Abbott test or other types of COVID-19 tests are offering them only to patients who go through a screening process and are found to have symptoms or to medical personnel and first-responders.

Erickson says Rush is using a combination of the Abbott kits, its own in-house tests and tests sent to private labs. The testing process is “very orchestrated” and not set up for walk-in visits by the public. Everyone must first be screened via a video visit or by a clinic, emergency room or hospital personnel and deemed a good candidate for testing.

Dr. Warren Wollin, senior director of Physicians Immediate Care, which has five drive-up centers in Chicago and elsewhere in northern Illinois, says the tests are limited to screened, symptomatic patients and first-responders.

“We try to keep it as low-risk as possible by keeping it outside the clinic,” Wollin says of the drive-up sites.

With the rapid test, patients get results while they wait in their cars, and medical professionals can act immediately if someone needs urgent care, Wollin says. Those who test positive but aren’t feeling ill might be directed to have a telehealth visit online.

What isn’t known yet: exactly how accurate the various COVID-19 tests are. Normally, reems of data have to be submitted to the FDA before a test is approved. But the usually stringent requirements were waived to more quickly bring testing to the public.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Nothing.

Yet millions of people have been panicking about their household supply. Store shelves have been emptied. Amazon is often out of stock. And social media is bursting with jokes and pleas for a roll or two.

Get the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.

The good news: Things are calming down, at least in the U.S., after a buying spree in mid-March. But it’s not yet clear when — if ever — buying habits will get back to normal.

Here’s all you ever wanted to know about toilet paper during a pandemic:

WHY IS TOILET PAPER IN SHORT SUPPLY?

One reason is because people are hoarding. Some were stockpiling last month in advance of city and state lockdown orders. It’s a common reaction in times of a crisis, when consumers feel a need for control and security, says David Garfield, global leader of the consumer products practice at AlixPartners, a consulting firm.

NCSolutions, a data and consulting firm, said online and in-store U.S. toilet paper sales rose 51% between Feb. 24 and March 10, as buyers started getting uneasy about the growing number of virus cases. But sales rocketed a whopping 845% on March 11 and 12 as states announced lockdowns.

WHAT ARE SOME OTHER REASONS FOR THE SHORTAGES?

Toilet paper flows from paper mills to retail stores through a tight, efficient supply chain. Toilet paper is bulky and not very profitable, so retailers don’t keep a lot of inventory on hand; they just get frequent shipments and restock their shelves.

“You never noticed because it’s so well-managed,” said Jim Luke, an economics professor at Lansing Community College in Michigan, who used to be a strategist for a toilet paper distribution company.

The amount of toilet paper the average American uses hasn’t changed; it’s still around 141 rolls per year (compared to 134 rolls in Germany and just 49 rolls in China, AlixParters says). But even small changes in buying habits can throw everything into disarray.

With a regional disruption like a hurricane, stores can redirect some inventory to the affected area. But a global pandemic doesn’t leave a lot of wiggle room.

CAN’T COMPANIES JUST MAKE MORE TOILET PAPER?

The big three U.S. toilet paper companies — Georgia-Pacific LLC, Proctor & Gamble Co. and Kimberly-Clark Corp. — were already running their toilet paper plants 24 hours a day before the new coronavirus hit. That’s the only way they can make a profit on such a low-margin product.

The companies are trying to increase output by making fewer varieties of toilet paper. They’re also trying to get the product to stores more quickly. Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific is working with packaging suppliers to get more materials and maximizing the number of deliveries it can ship from its facilities.

CAN SUPPLIES BE REDIRECTED TO HOUSEHOLDS INSTEAD OF BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOW CLOSED?

No. Commercial toilet paper uses a different kind of pulp and is produced on different machines. Many institutional rolls are intentionally larger, so cleaning staff don’t have to refill them as often and people don’t steal them, Luke said. Plusher toilet paper for home use also has different packaging requirements, Garfield said.

Prior to the coronavirus crisis, about half of U.S. toilet paper sales were commercial, while the other half were for homes, Garfield said. That’s changing; AlixPartners estimates U.S. household demand is up 40% as offices and schools close.

But Georgia-Pacific said commercial demand hasn’t yet fallen. It has seen a surge of orders from hospitals and other essential businesses that are still operating.

ARE SUPPLIES IN GROCERIES AND OTHER RETAILERS IMPROVING?

Demand has softened a bit since mid-March, so that should make it easier to find toilet paper. NCSolutions said sales are down 62% right now compared to the “extreme buying period” of March 11-24. But they’re still 6% higher than they were before the new coronavirus hit the U.S.

Kroger, the nation’s biggest grocery chain, said most of its stores are now getting truckloads of paper products every day or every other day. Kroger and other retailers have also established limits on the amount of toilet paper people can buy at one time.

WHEN WILL THINGS GET BACK TO NORMAL?

Nobody knows. For one thing, the new coronavirus could permanently increase the demand for household toilet paper.

“Will the workforce go back to work like they did before? If people work from home, this could be much more prolonged,” says NCSolutions CEO Linda Dupree.

Raising prices on toilet paper — as was done in 1973 during the oil embargo — might curb hoarding, Garfield said. But it would make it harder for some consumers to afford.

ARE THERE WAYS TO CUT DOWN ON TOILET PAPER USE?

U.S. searches for “bidet” reached an all-time high in March, according to Google Trends. Tushy, which makes a $100 bidet attachment for toilets, said its sales spiked in mid-March, hitting $1 million in a single day.

One by one, women in homes across rural Zimbabwe had a pleading question: When would family planning services return?

Lockdowns imposed to curb the coronavirus’ spread have put millions of women in Africa, Asia and elsewhere out of reach of birth control and other sexual and reproductive health needs. Confined to their homes with their husbands and others, they face unwanted pregnancies and little idea of when they can reach the outside world again.

In these uncertain times, women “have to lock down their uterus,” Abebe Shibru, Zimbabwe country director for Marie Stopes International, told The Associated Press. “But there is no way in a rural area.”

Eighteen countries in Africa have imposed national lockdowns, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All but essential workers or those seeking food or health care must stay home for weeks, maybe longer. Rwanda, the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to impose a lockdown, has extended it for two weeks, a possible sign of things to come.

Even where family planning remains available, providers say many women fear venturing out and being beaten by security forces and accused of defying the new restrictions. Meanwhile, outreach services, the key to reaching rural women, have largely stopped to avoid drawing crowds and the risk of workers spreading the virus from one community to another.

The International Planned Parenthood Federation, or IPPF, in a new report Thursday says more than one in five member clinics around the world have closed because of the pandemic and related restrictions. More than 5,000 mobile clinics across 64 countries have closed. Most are in South Asia and Africa, but Latin America and Europe have seen hundreds of closures as well.

From Pakistan to Germany to Colombia, IPPF members say they have scaled down HIV testing and gender-based violence response work and face shortages of contraceptives.

“They have needs that cannot wait,” IPPF director-general Alvaro Bermejo said of women in a statement, pleading for help from national governments to help provide personal protective equipment to allow for intimate care.

For most people, the coronavirus causes mild to moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. But for some, especially older adults and the infirm, it can cause pneumonia and death.

In Europe, 100 non-governmental groups on Wednesday called on governments to ensure reproductive health services during the pandemic, saying many facilities have sharply reduced them or shut down. The French government last month said pharmacies can deliver contraceptive pills to women unable to renew prescriptions under lockdown.

The predicted baby boom in Africa alone, even as birth rates have dropped in many countries as more girls are educated, will add to the growth that already is projected to see the continent of 1.3 billion people double in population by 2050.

In Zimbabwe, Marie Stopes provided more than 400,000 women last year with family planning services, Shibru said, including averting nearly 50,000 unsafe abortions. But now the organization’s outreach services, which reach more than 60% of clients, are suspended. Even at clinics that remain open, the number of clients has dropped by 70%.

That leaves a country of men, no longer free to work in the fields or elsewhere, and without the distraction of sports, confined with their wives for weeks on end.

“Husband and wife, what else can they be doing in that house?” asked Future Gwena, a Marie Stopes outreach worker. “I think we’re going to have a lot of pregnancies and, unfortunately, unintended. And most will result in unsafe abortions, domestic violence. Our community is paternalistic. If something goes wrong in the home, it’s the mother’s fault, even if the man initiated it.”

Even in normal times, the average woman seeking contraception must get consent from her husband, Shibru said.

Meanwhile, travel restrictions and manufacturing slowdowns in Asia as a result of the pandemic mean that some family planning providers are waiting for shipments of emergency contraceptives and other items as stocks run short at home.

“Today I expected a shipment from Asia, but it’s suspended,” Shibru said. “I don’t know how to fill that gap. It was supposed to come today to serve us for the coming six months. So this is one of the tragedies. ... We’re expecting a huge shortage of contraceptives in African countries. Absolutely, condoms also.”

In Uganda, Marie Stopes country director Carole Sekimpi said they don’t know when a shipment of emergency contraceptives will arrive because India, their source, has also locked down. They’ve been out of stock for a month and need oral contraceptive pills as well, she said.

“Yesterday when I heard (neighboring) Kenya talking about a lockdown in Nairobi and (the port of) Mombasa I thought, ‘My god, what’s going to happen to all of our shipments?’” she said. “Overall, there’s definitely going to be a problem.”

She worried about the girls and women confined in homes with potential assailants, even uncles or cousins. Her organization has suspended outreach, which provides about 40% of services, and clinics that remain open have seen a drop in client traffic of about 20%.

“We don’t see you anymore,” anxious callers say. “What’s happening?”

Even the capital, Kampala, has been affected. Sekimpi said she visited a large government-run hospital there on Monday, “but when I got there my heart was broken because the one service suspended was family planning. With good reason, because it’s usually crowded.”

She expects not only a baby boom but a rise in unsafe abortions and post-abortion care, along with panicky women seeking to remove their IUD (intrauterine device) or birth control implant earlier than expected as they fear no family planning worker will be around to help them later.

Even the U.S. Embassy in Uganda has taken note of the challenges women face, tweeting that “Periods don’t pause for pandemics” and sharing advice on how to make washable sanitary pads at home.

The range of issues is similar across Africa, Shibru in Zimbabwe said, citing a daily call with country directors in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Madagascar and elsewhere.

“Look, everything has been diverted to COVID,” he said of the disease caused by the coronavirus. “But after COVID, another catastrophe will be women’s health, unless something is done right now.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

So, he called NBC Sports Chicago senior vice president and general manager Kevin Cross and pitched the idea of the station potentially holding a telethon.

“I said, ‘Listen, Eddie, you got me at hello. I think it’s a great idea,” Cross said Tuesday in a phone interview. “As a station, [we had] been doing things to try to help the community as well. We put together a promo that got all of our talent together and told everybody to be strong and ... we were looking at what else we could do and when Edzo came with this idea, we ran with it.”

In partnership with United Way of Metro Chicago and Chicago Community Trust, NBC Sports Chicago is hosting the “Be Chicago: Together We Can” telethon Wednesday, which will benefit the community COVID-19 Response Fund and honor front-line workers.

The four-hour TV event, which begins at 7 p.m., will feature several celebrated Chicago athletes — like Horace Grant, A.J. Pierzynski and Brian Urlacher — and exclusive music performances by Chicago, Brett Eldredge and the Plain White T’s.

There will be segments on the 1990s Bulls, 2005 White Sox and 2010 Blackhawks, with some players from each team discussing their favorite memories. Tim Anderson, Coby White and Tarik Cohen will also team up for a segment where the three young stars will discuss how their professional and personal lives have been affected by the pandemic and how this experience has changed their lives.

Fans without cable can tune in to the event on the MyTeams by NBC Sports app.

“People need a release,” said David Kaplan, who is co-hosting the event with Olczyk. “And I think tomorrow night will give [that release to] people. They understand what we’re all fighting against, but they’re also going to have a lot of fun.”

But the night’s focus isn’t all on sports.

The telethon will also include “Hero segments,” where nominated front-line workers will meet their favorite Chicago athletes via Zoom video conferencing.

Kaplan got to be on the call with one Lutheran General Hospital nurse who helped COVID-19 patients and their families. The nurse was surprised to learn his favorite athlete, Jon Lester, was also on the call.

We won’t give away too many spoilers, but Lester promised to give the nurse a once-in-a-lifetime experience at Wrigley Field when baseball returns.

“It was an emotionally charged moment,” Kaplan said. “And yeah, it’s cool to have all these celebrities on the thing .... but those are the moments people are going to get tears and go, ‘That’s amazing.’”

Most of the programming will be pre-taped and the interviews featured all took place via video conferencing calls from the individual’s own homes.

“We didn’t want to do something where we’re telling people to stay at home but we’re leaving our homes,” Cross said, “because that would be kind of hypocritical.”

There is one exception, however. Kaplan said he met up with Olczyk in the former Blackhawks forward’s backyard to shoot the opener, though he promised the camera crew wore masks and there was a tape measurer on the ground to make sure Kaplan and Olczyk remained at least six feet apart.

Viewers can donate by texting “Help4ChiCovid” to 41444 or visit NBCSportsChicago.com/BeChicago. All proceeds will go to the Chicago Community COVID-19 Response Fund, which has raised more than $25 million for the region’s most vulnerable residents.

NBC Sports Chicago’s goal is to “raise the most amount of money we possibly can.”

“We’re in sports and part of being in sports just by the very nature of that business is you’re used to keeping score,” said Cross, who also said NBC and Comcast have already made “sizable” donations to the fund. “And I think it’s important to keep score but I’ve told the folks don’t worry about the score, just do the best you can to reach the most amount of people.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

And this time, they’ll have company.

Turner Sports says quarterbacks Tom Brady and Peyton Manning will join them for a two-on-two match sometime in May. Missing from the announcement were such details as when and where the match would be played, except that tournament organizers would work with government and health officials to meet safety and health standards.

Turner said all donations and fundraising from “The Match: Champions for Charity” would benefit relief efforts for the COVID-19 pandemic.

The event will be televised on TNT, with social and digital content leading up and during the event available through Bleacher Report and House of Highlights.

“It’s on now,” Mickelson tweeted Wednesday afternoon responding to Bleacher Report.

He added that he would be paired with Brady, saying:

“After feeling the sting of defeat the first time around, Looks like @TigerWoods is bringing a ringer to The Match (#PeytonManning). I’m bringing a GOAT. @TomBrady — Ready to hit bombs?”

The first match over Thanksgiving weekend in November 2018 was supposed to be pay-per-view, except that technical difficulties allowed everyone to watch.

It lacked some of wild bets both players had teased, and the trash talking was forced at times. Mickelson ended up winning the $9 million winner-take-all purse in a wedge contest under the lights when the matched ended in a tie.

Live golf was last seen on television March 12, the first round of The Players Championship as developments with the new coronavirus accelerated at such a rate that sports began shutting down.

The PGA Tour first decided not to have fans at the TPC Sawgrass, then canceled its premier event, and then began canceling or postponing all tournaments across each of its tours.

Woods was not at The Players. The defending Masters champion has not played since he finished last in his Genesis Invitational at Riviera on Feb. 16. Saying his back did not feel ready, Woods chose not to play the Mexico Championship, the Arnold Palmer Invitational and The Players Championship.

Woods and Manning have played together in pro-ams on the PGA Tour.

He was 48.

The newspaper reported Causi’s death on its website Sunday night and included an image of Monday’s back page. It featured a photo of Causi holding a camera with a long lens and the words “Our Eyes, Our Heart” and then below: “And our city’s loss.”

Causi was married with two young children. Many of New York’s professional teams and several players posted messages on Twitter expressing sadness, condolences and paying tribute to him.

“Do you know how many athletes reached out when they heard he was sick?” said Stephen Lynch, editor-in-chief at the Post. “Players from every team, sending thoughts, hoping he was going to be all right.”

Major League Baseball called Causi a “sports photojournalist extraordinaire” and said he “brought out the best in the players and the people of our National Pastime.”

Causi was a smiling and friendly fixture at venues from Yankee Stadium to Madison Square Garden and others all over the New York area. His action shots often popped impressively on The Post’s sports pages, and he was well-liked not only by media colleagues but also the famous players he chronicled.

“What a great man. So sorry to hear,” tweeted Texas Rangers infielder Todd Frazier, who played for both the Yankees and Mets. “God found his angel photographer that’s for sure.”

Curtis Granderson, former Yankees and Mets outfielder, wrote: “New York baseball won’t be the same without him in the photo pit.”

Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Didi Gregorius, who played for the Yankees from 2015-19: “Anthony was a great, funny and awesome guy to talk to and learn from about sports photography ... may he Rest In Peace.”

Lynch called Causi “a brilliant journalist.”

“He was, quite simply, one of the best sports photographers in New York City, capturing all the major moments of the past 25 years. Soft-spoken, funny, but most of all kind — he was respected by those he photographed and admired by those with whom he worked,” Lynch said.

“The Post that you read, and the newsroom that we work in, are less colorful today because of his absence. Our hearts go out to his family, and we share their grief.”

Causi was born and raised in Brooklyn and he graduated from Pace University. He joined The Post in 1994 as a photo messenger before advancing to photo editor and then full-time journalist photographer, the newspaper said.

His uncle, Joe Causi, an on-air personality for WCBS-FM Radio, said his nephew often took photos at Little League events pro bono, the Post said.

The Post said Causi is survived by his wife, Romina, and their children, John, 5, and Mia, 2, as well as his parents, Lucille and John Causi, and sisters Maria Marangelli and Dianna Marotto.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

On Wednesday, Latinos became the first racial or ethnic group in Chicago to record more than 10,000 cases of the coronavirus, according to data released by the city. Latinos now account for 42% of all COVID-19 cases despite making up around 30% of the population.

Lightfoot acknowledged shortcomings in the city’s efforts to reach Latinos early on in the pandemic, particularly residents who are primarily Spanish speakers.

Part of the problem, Lightfoot said, was the lack of testing sites in Latino neighborhoods.

“Early on, we were worried that there was a significant undercount among [Latinos] .... we were not getting enough demographic data from the providers doing testing so that we could fully measure the impact this virus,” she said.

Now that testing has ramped up and a clearer picture has emerged, Lightfoot said her administration is laser-focused on curbing the spread of the virus in neighborhoods that have recorded the biggest spikes like Little Village, Belmont Cragin and Archer Heights.

Crucial to curbing the spread of the virus in those areas are community health centers, Lightfoot said, which predominantly serve black and Latino Chicagoans and are open to everyone regardless of whether they health insurance, including undocumented immigrants.

Lightfoot called on those community health centers to refer patients to hotels the city has contracted to quarantine if they test positive for COVID-19, especially if they live in crowded, multigenerational households and can’t isolate.

“Early on in our response to this virus, we set up hotels that were specifically designated for quarantining and isolation, and so we need to do a better job of communicating the availability of those resources in the Latinx community, and that’s where [community health centers] play a very important role,” Lightfoot said.

The city will also rely upon community groups who provide resources and know-your-rights trainings to immigrants, Lightfoot said, “and we are tapping into that network to help us both educate and understand the day-to-day lived experiences [of Latinos.]”

Lightfoot said social distancing and working from home are “luxuries” that many Latinos can’t afford and promised to make workplaces as safe as possible during the pandemic.

“The biggest issue we have,” said Ald. Mike Rodriguez (22nd), whose ward encompasses Little Village, “is that a lot residents who are deemed to work ‘essential’ jobs in industries where the proximity of workers lead to higher rates of the virus.”

Jorge Mujica, a labor organizer with Arise Chicago who listened in to the town hall Wednesday, said Lightfoot should send police officers to inspect work sites to ensure physical distancing measures are being implemented.

“It’s pointless to keep telling the community to stay at home if they’re being infected at work,” he said. “The mayor sent the cops over to the lakefront and to the 606 Trail, but she should really send to them factories to inspect whether or not workers are being protected.”

Aunt Martha’s, a statewide nonprofit, is the only agency in Illinois to be both a licensed child welfare provider and a federally qualified health center. Since 2002, it has owned a single-family home in the south suburb that has served homeless young adults.

In its lawsuit filed Tuesday, Aunt Martha’s alleges that the village of Midlothian is arbitrarily — and illegally — trying to stop the agency’s plan to temporarily house and care for underage wards of the state at the property during the COVID-19 pandemic. The agency alleges that Midlothian has violated the Fair Housing Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act.

“Aunt Martha’s has been a good neighbor at this location for more than eight years. We hope the Village does not turn its back on the children in the face of a global crisis that demands compassion, collaboration and accommodation,” Raul Garza, CEO and president of Aunt Martha’s, said in a statement.

Midlothian’s attorney did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Aunt Martha’s alleges that on April 20, the village, citing zoning laws, told the organization that no one under the age of 18 would be allowed to stay in the home.

The village is “deliberately and wrongfully misapplying zoning provisions and inapplicable building code requirements, declaring that ‘under no circumstances is Aunt Martha’s permitted to accept residents between 0 to 18’ unless Aunt Martha’s complied with its demand that it seek ‘at a minimum a text amendment to Midlothian’s Zoning Code or a special use permit’ and meet institutional building code requirements,” the suit alleges.

Aunt Martha’s maintains that the village’s existing zoning code explicitly allows minors to be housed at the property.

The organization said it’s made “significant” investments in preparing the property to house and care for COVID-19-positive children. The property passed an inspection by the state fire marshal in April and was also inspected and licensed to operate by the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services.

“In addition to redesigning the space to accommodate and isolate the children placed there, preparing the CQC required the installation of a negative pressure ventilation system to control the spread of airborne pathogens,” Aunt Martha’s said in a statement.

In March, the young adults who were staying at the property were moved into hotels to ensure they can still be served, the suit states.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Results were based from about 5,600 completed records from employees of 26 clubs. Samples were obtained on April 14 and 15.

“It allows us to get a peek of the nation-wide prevalence,” said Dr. Jay Bhattacharya at Stanford, one the study’s leaders, said Sunday.

The start of the baseball season has been delayed because of the virus outbreak. There’s no timetable for when the season might begin.

Sixty people tested positive in the raw data, and adjustments were made for false positives and false negatives. Bhattacharya said the survey had a 0.5% false positive rate.

Antibodies are produced by a person’s immune system if they have been infected by a virus.

MLB employees have been less affected than their surrounding communities have been, Bhattacharya said.

The University of Southern California and the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory in Salt Lake City also led the study.

Data for players was not broken out. The study was not representative of the overall population, given 95% of the participants were under 65 and few reported comorbidities.

MLB team doctors looked at results last month. The goal of the study was to better determine how widespread COVID-19 is, which could aid governments and health professionals in their evaluation of when to lift stay-at-home orders.

The Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati, Colorado and Miami did not participate, Bhattacharya said.

“The MLB population is a special population. They’re not representative of every city that they’re in,” Bhattacharya said. “They also are more well to do than a typical population, so it’s not representative. ... They have an organization that allows us to sample in just two days time in so many places all at once. And that’s unique.”

“I don’t get the sense that they are doing it to benefit them,” Bhattacharya said. “If the economy opens up, sports are huge gatherings. So in a sense it benefits everybody. I actually think they’re doing it because they want to contribute to public health knowledge.”

Each club was given approximately 350 tests.

“To be able to have a window into how widespread the epidemic is in so many places all at once is a really special thing,” Bhattacharya said.

But records show that over the following three weeks, the agency scrambled to turn Trump’s pledge into a reality, spending nearly $3 billion to spur U.S. manufacturers to crank out the breathing machines at an unprecedented pace.

An analysis of federal contracting data by The Associated Press shows the agency is now on track to exceed 100,000 new ventilators by around July 13, about a week later than the 100-day deadline Trump first gave on March 27.

By the end of 2020, the administration is expected to take delivery of nearly 200,000 new ventilators, based on the AP’s review of current federal purchasing contracts. That would more than double the estimated 160,000 ventilators hospitals across the U.S. had before the pandemic.

“We became the king of ventilators, thousands and thousands of ventilators,” Trump boasted in an April 29 speech.

But over the past month, demand for ventilators has decreased even as the U.S. death toll from the novel coronavirus has surged past 80,000. After observing unusually high death rates for coronavirus victims who were put on ventilators, many doctors are using them only as a last resort.

That’s raising the unexpected prospect that the United States could soon be awash in surplus ventilators, so much so the White House is now planning to ship thousands overseas to help boost the virus response of other nations.

In a speech to Republican members of Congress on Friday, the president credited his son-in-law, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, with heading up the effort to purchase the ventilators.

“We built, and we built, and we built,” Trump said. “Now we have nine factories that are throwing out ventilators at numbers that nobody can believe. It was really — there’s not been anything like that, since the Second World War, where we did the same thing with other types of product.”

Daniel Adelman, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business who teaches health care analytics, said the U.S. government is now buying more than twice the number of ventilators it needs, even under a worst-case scenario forecasting the spread of COVID-19.

But Adelman said mathematical models cannot predict with certainty how many ventilators will be needed if there is a resurgence of the coronavirus later in the year or if there is another pandemic in the future.

“It seems incongruent with the forecasts that you’re seeing,” Adelman said of the government purchases. “I’d probably rather they order too many rather than ordering too few.”

In patients with severe cases of COVID-19, the virus attacks the lungs, causing fluid to collect in tiny air sacs called alveoli. That makes it difficult for the lungs to transfer oxygen from the air to the blood, which can be deadly. To treat these low oxygen levels, doctors have historically relied on ventilators.

The Strategic National Stockpile, the federal government’s emergency reserve of medical supplies, had about 16,660 ventilators ready to deploy at the start of March, with an additional 2,400 out for maintenance.

By the middle of the month, health officials and governors in states with the worst virus outbreaks began expressing concerns that the supply of breathing machines could run out, potentially leaving thousands of critically ill patients gasping for air.

Among those calling for additional ventilators was Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-N.Y.), who predicted on March 24 that all of the ventilators in his state would be in use, and patients in need would be left without proper treatment. Cuomo said projections showed New York would need at least 30,000 additional ventilators to get through the mid-April peak of the outbreak. At that point, FEMA had sent New York 400.

Trump expressed skepticism at Cuomo’s figures even as his administration rushed to send New York 4,000 additional ventilators — about one-quarter of the nation’s entire emergency stockpile. Still, Cuomo pleaded for more.

“You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die,” Cuomo said at a news conference,

It wasn’t just New York, however. Similarly dire projections of a ventilator shortfall were also then circulating within the White House.

“The scariest day of my life was about a month ago when, after a long day of meetings, my team told me that we were going to be needing 130,000 ventilators; that we were short hundreds of thousands of ventilators,” Trump recounted in an April 14 briefing. “I had governors requesting unreasonable sums that the federal government just didn’t have.”

By late March, a bipartisan chorus of state governors and members of Congress were calling on the president to exercise his emergency authority under the Defense Production Act to force U.S. companies to produce ventilators.

Trump had resisted invoking the Korean War-era law, which grants the president sole authority to direct U.S. industrial production of critical supplies in times of national emergency, saying the private sector was stepping up production of ventilators and other medical supplies on its own.

But on March 27, Trump changed course, announcing that he would invoke the Defense Production Act to produce ventilators, which meant companies would have to give priority to federal orders over other customers.

“In the next 100 days — well, first of all, we’ve already delivered thousands of them — but within the next 100 days, we will either make or get, in some form, over 100,000 additional units,” Trump said.

By the start of April, FEMA officials confirmed to the House Oversight and Reform Committee that demand for ventilators would soon outpace the available supply. To ration what was left, FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor directed that the remaining ventilators in the national stockpile be designated as a “strategic national asset” — to be provided to states only on a case-by-case basis where hospitals could demonstrate an “exigent need” to sustain life within 72 hours.

Federal purchasing records show that three months into the pandemic, HHS, which includes the Strategic National Stockpile, had not yet placed any orders for new ventilators in 2020.

That changed within three days of Trump’s March 27 edict, with HSS signing a $350 million deal with Zoll Medical Corp. Records show a flurry of about a dozen big orders with other ventilator makers over the next two weeks, most of them no-bid contracts exempted from the typical federal purchasing rules due to the national emergency.

In a typical year, U.S. companies produce about 29,000 ventilators, according to data cited by the White House. Though several domestic manufacturers had already announced they were adding extra shifts and hiring additional workers to ramp up production, AP’s analysis of HHS contracts show that even with the emergency no-bid orders the traditional medical device makers would deliver about 73,990 new ventilators by July 6 — the 100-day mark since Trump’s March 27 pledge.

It was clear additional industrial capacity would be needed to get 100,000 units by the president’s deadline.

General Motors, which had shut down auto production, had already entered into a partnership on March 20 with Ventec Life Systems, a small ventilator company, to simplify an off-the-shelf design for rapid production at GM’s Kokomo, Indiana, plant.

Though GM had announced it was “working night and day” to launch production, Trump accused CEO Mary Barra via Twitter of dragging her feet, and revived his long-running feud with the company over its 2019 closure of an Ohio factory that Trump had pledged to save.

“As usual with ‘this’ General Motors, things just never seem to work out,” Trump tweeted on March 27. “General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!!”

GM had sold the Lordstown factory in 2019.

The president also took aim at Ford Motor Co., tweeting that the rival automaker should also “GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!!”

On April 8, HHS announced it had reached a $489.4 million deal with GM to produce 30,000 ventilators by the end of August, with the first 6,132 delivered by June 1.

The following week, HHS announced a $336 million contract with Ford and General Electric, which teamed up to make 50,000 of GE Healthcare’s ventilators by July 13.

Assuming all the companies meet their deadlines, AP’s analysis shows the national stockpile should surpass 100,000 new ventilators by mid-July.

HHS declined to release to AP its contracts with ventilator producers without a Freedom of Information Act request, a legal process that can often take months or even years.

But AP’s analysis of the limited contract data available online and figures taken from HHS media releases shows the agency will spend more than $2.9 billion for 198,890 ventilators by the end of 2020, an average per-unit cost of $14,618.

Whether that’s a good deal for U.S. taxpayers is difficult to determine because medical device makers generally don’t publish their prices. HHS is buying at least 13 different models of ventilators from 10 different companies, all with different capabilities, features and accessories.

When AP sought details from HHS about the per-unit cost of four models from manufacturer Hamilton Medical, the agency’s press office provided figures that did not add up to the totals announced in earlier media releases. An HHS spokesperson said the previously provided figures were wrong and would be corrected on the agency’s website.

AP found several instances where the U.S. government had purchased the same models of ventilators before the pandemic. For example, contracting data does show that in December the Department of Defense bought a single, portable ventilator from Zoll Medical for $12,260.

Under its current contract with Zoll, HHS is purchasing 18,900 of the same model for slightly more than $350 million. That works out to about $18,500 each, which would be a more than 50 percent increase from what the Pentagon paid less than five months ago.

A HHS spokeswoman said Friday the government was paying about $12,100 for each ventilator, and that the additional money was for hoses, face masks and other related supplies needed to treat COVID-19 patients. The ventilators also came with a wheeled plastic case with power port, which cost an additional $722 each, according to HHS.

The Defense Department did not respond to questions Friday about whether its 2019 ventilator deliveries also included accessories.

Zoll’s top executive said his company’s pricing had remained consistent.

“Zoll is supplying the U.S. government with its requested products at our usual and customary government pricing, absorbing the additional costs associated with Zoll’s rapid increase in production capacity,” Zoll CEO Jonathan Rennert said Friday. “We are focused on fulfilling the government’s order on time and meeting this urgent public need.”

Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan who studies the medical device industry, said ventilator companies are probably incurring increased costs as they ramp up production to meet high demand. Manufacturers haven’t had time to bulk buy additional parts and probably had to add workers to make more of the machines, he said.

U.S. ventilator makers have raised production from a rate of about 700 per week in February to about 5,000 per week by early April, according to the Advanced Medical Technology Association, an industry trade group.

“If you don’t have time to change your manufacturing processes to get those economies of scale, you get there by brute force, extra labor,” said Gordon, who teaches a course in monetizing medical device ideas. “Your costs actually go up, not down.”

With the federal government buying most of the new ventilators being made in the U.S., state governments and hospital systems urgently seeking the machines have often been forced to go through middlemen or foreign suppliers.

Cuomo has compared the free-for-all bidding to going on eBay, and said during a March 31 briefing that New York had ordered 17,000 ventilators from China for $25,000 each.

“We are paying $25,000 per ventilator, and we are broke,” Cuomo said. “The last thing I want to do is buy a single ventilator I don’t need.”

More than a month later, only 2,500 of the Chinese machines have been delivered, according to Cuomo’s office. In a separate case, New York officials are trying to recover another $69.1 million paid to a Silicon Valley electrical engineer who promised 1,450 ventilators that never materialized.

With nearly 200,000 new ventilators set for delivery to the federal stockpile by the end of the year, Trump is declaring victory. But it is now unclear whether the stockpile of new ventilators will be needed.

In the little more than a month since Trump announced the buying spree, a series of medical studies has spurred questions about whether ventilators are effective at saving the lives of critically ill COVID-19 patients.

A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 30 found that only 1 of 7 patients older than 70 who were put on a ventilator survived. For patients younger than 70, just 36% lived.

In New York City, state officials say 80% or more of coronavirus patients placed on the machines died.

The studies have caused doctors to reevaluate the use of ventilators in favor of less intensive forms of respiratory support.

Trump administration officials say the new ventilators could still prove valuable if the virus outbreak were to intensify into a second wave after the warm summer months.

“It’s very important that we have a completely refreshed and a comprehensive stockpile going into the fall,” Dr. Deborah Birx, a medical adviser on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said at a briefing on April 21. “I think that’s why we’ve continued to bring in those shipments and work on the ventilators so that those would be available not only for the United States but certainly if other partner countries have this level of tragedy.”

Trump said he intends to ship thousands of the breathing machines overseas, where the needs are greater.

On Tuesday, Mexico said it received a shipment of ventilators from the United States. Trump said last week Russia is also set to receive U.S. ventilators, along with other countries.

“People dying because they don’t have ventilators, and they’re not equipped to do what we did,” Trump said Friday. “So we’re giving thousands and thousands of these ventilators away to many countries that have suffered greatly: Italy, France, Spain, so many countries. And Nigeria called. Tremendous problems in Nigeria. Tremendous problems all over. And so they’re very happy.”

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin predicted the American economy would rebound in the second half of this year from unemployment rates that rival the Great Depression. Another 3.2 million U.S. workers applied for jobless benefits last week, bringing the total over the last seven weeks to 33.5 million.

“I think you’re going to see a bounce-back from a low standpoint,” said Mnuchin, speaking on “Fox News Sunday.”

But the director of the University of Washington institute that created a White House-endorsed coronavirus model said the moves by states to re-open businesses “will translate into more cases and deaths in 10 days from now.” Dr. Christopher Murray of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation said states where cases and deaths are going up more than expected include Illinois, Arizona, Florida and California.

Many families faced their first Mother’s Day without loved ones lost in the pandemic. Others sent good wishes from a safe distance or through phone and video calls.

The virus has caused particular suffering for the elderly, with more than 26,000 deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, according to an Associated Press tally.

At a senior center in Smyrna, Georgia, 73-year-old Mary Washington spoke to her daughter Courtney Crosby and grandchild Sydney Crosby through a window.

In Grafton, West Virginia, where the tradition of Mother’s Day began 112 years ago, the brick building now known as the International Mother’s Day Shrine held its first online-only audience. Anna Jarvis first held a memorial service for her mother and all mothers on the second Sunday of May in 1908.

“Sheltered safely at home with the family together would be viewed by Anna Jarvis as exactly the way she wanted Mother’s Day to be observed,” said Marvin Gelhausen, chairman of the shrine’s board of trustees, in an address on YouTube.

Matilda Cuomo, the mother of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, called into her son’s daily briefing so he and his three daughters could wish her a happy Mother’s Day.

“I am so blessed as many mothers today are,” she said.

Andrew Cuomo, whose state is the deadliest hot spot for the virus in the U.S., said he looked forward to getting back to normal. “We’re going to have fun, and then you can spend more time with me. I know I am your favorite,” he said in a playful dig at his siblings.

He also announced two policy reversals a day after an Associated Press report in which residents’ relatives, watchdog groups and politicians from both parties alleged he was not doing enough to counter the surge of deaths in nursing homes, where about 5,300 residents have died. Nursing home staff in New York will now have to undergo COVID-19 tests twice a week and facilities will no longer be required to take in hospital patients who were infected.

The U.S. has seen 1.3 million infections and nearly 80,000 deaths, the most in the world by far, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Worldwide, 4 million people have been reported infected and more than 280,000 have died, over half of them in Europe, according to Johns Hopkins.

In the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a modest easing of the country’s coronavirus lockdown but urged citizens not to surrender the progress already made. The country has recorded the most virus deaths in Europe at over 31,900.

Those in the construction or manufacturing industries or other jobs that can’t be done at home “should be actively encouraged to go to work” this week, he said. Johnson, who has taken a tougher line after falling ill himself with what he called “this devilish illness,” set a goal of June 1 to begin re-opening schools and shops if the U.K. can control new infections and the transmission rate of each infected person.

“We will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity,” he said. “We’re going to be driven by the science, the data, and public health.”

Germany, which managed to push new infections below 1,000 daily before deciding to loosen restrictions, has seen regional spikes in cases linked to slaughterhouses and nursing homes. Health officials say the number of people each confirmed virus patient infects rose above 1 again, reflecting a renewed increase in cases. The number must be below 1 for outbreaks to decline.

France is letting some younger students go back to school Monday after almost two months out. Attendance won’t be compulsory right away. Residents of some Spanish regions will be able to enjoy limited seating at bars, restaurants and other public places Monday, but Madrid and Barcelona, the country’s largest cities, will remain shut down.

China, where the virus was first detected, reported 14 new cases Sunday, its first double-digit rise in 10 days. Eleven of 12 domestic infections were in the northeastern province of Jilin, prompting authorities to raise the threat level in one of its counties, Shulan, to high risk, just days after downgrading all regions to low risk.

Authorities said the Shulan outbreak originated with a 45-year-old woman who had no recent travel or exposure history but spread it to her husband, three sisters and other relatives. Train services in the county were suspended.

“Epidemic control and prevention is a serious and complicated matter, and local authorities should never be overly optimistic, war-weary or off-guard,” said Jilin Communist Party secretary Bayin Chaolu.

South Korea reported 34 more cases as new infections linked to nightclubs threaten its hard-won gains against the virus. It was the first time that South Korea’s daily infections were above 30 in about a month.

Obama also reacted to the Justice Department dropping its criminal case against Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, saying he worried that the “basic understanding of rule of law is at risk.”

More than 78,400 people with COVID-19 have died in the United States and more than 1.3 million people have tested positive, according to the latest estimates from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.

Obama’s comments came during a Friday call with 3,000 members of the Obama Alumni Association, people who served in his administration. Obama urged his supporters to back his former vice president, Joe Biden, who is trying to unseat Trump in the Nov. 3 election.

“What we’re fighting against is these long-term trends in which being selfish, being tribal, being divided, and seeing others as an enemy — that has become a stronger impulse in American life. And by the way, we’re seeing that internationally as well. It’s part of the reason why the response to this global crisis has been so anemic and spotty,” Obama said, according to Yahoo News.

“It would have been bad even with the best of governments. It has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset — of ‘what’s in it for me’ and ‘to heck with everybody else’ — when that mindset is operationalized in our government,” he said.

Trump has consistently defended and boasted of his response to the virus, saying that travel restrictions from China and Europe as well as social distancing guidelines have prevented far greater damage. “I think we saved millions of lives,” he said earlier this week.

Trump has criticized the Obama administration in relation to his own administration’s response to the outbreak. Yet Trump’s contention that his administration inherited “a broken system and a broken test” from Obama’s is false; the novel coronavirus did not exist until late last year. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention struggled to develop its own test in January and then discovered problems in its kits in February.

White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany did not mention Obama directly in her response to his remarks.

“President Trump’s coronavirus response has been unprecedented and saved American lives,” she said. “While Democrats were pursuing a sham witch hunt against President Trump, President Trump was shutting down travel from China.”

She added: “While Democrats encouraged mass gatherings, President Trump was deploying PPE, ventilators, and testing across the country.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The new outbreaks — and the fears of a second wave of contagion — underscored the dangers authorities face as they try to reopen their economies.

Around the world, the U.S. and other hard-hit countries are wrestling with how to ease curbs on business and public activity without causing the virus to come surging back.

Elsewhere, Belarus, which has not locked down despite increasing case numbers, saw tens of thousands of people turn out to mark Victory Day, the anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat in 1945. That was in contrast to Russia, which skipped the usual grand parade in Red Square.

Germany and South Korea have both carried out extensive testing and contact tracing and have been hailed for avoiding the mass deaths that have overwhelmed other countries. But even there, authorities have struggled with finding the balance between saving lives and saving jobs.

In South Korea, where a decline in new cases had prompted the government to loosen up, Seoul shut down thousands of nightclubs, hostess bars and discos after dozens of infections were linked to clubgoers who went out last weekend as the country relaxed its social-distancing guidelines.

Many of the infections were linked to a 29-year-old man who visited three nightclubs before testing positive. Mayor Park Won-soon said health workers were trying to contact some 1,940 people who had been at the three clubs and other places nearby.

The mayor said gains made against the virus are now threatened “because of a few careless people.”

Health officials in Germany faced outbreaks at three slaughterhouses in what was seen as a test of the government’s strategy for dealing with any resurgence of the virus as the restrictions are eased. At one slaughterhouse, in Coesfeld, 180 workers tested positive for the virus.

Germany’s NGG union, which represents food industry workers, said the outbreaks were the result of “a sick system.” Freddy Adjan, a senior union official, said the meat industry has for years been relying on “dubious subcontractors” that exploit workers.

U.S. authorities are likewise watching for a second wave, more than two weeks after states began gradually reopening, with Georgia largely leading the way.

Meanwhile, governments came under fresh scrutiny over their handling of the crisis.

German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Europe must acknowledge that it “wasn’t well-prepared” for the outbreak. In the U.S., internal government emails obtained by The Associated Press show that a decision to shelve detailed advice from the nation’s top disease control experts for reopening communities during the epidemic came from the highest levels of the White House.

Worldwide, the virus is confirmed to have infected over 3.9 million people and killed more than 275,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University based on data reported by governments.

Hard-hit Italy saw people return to the streets for their traditional aperitivos and revel in fine weather as restrictions there eased. In some cases, people went too far for the authorities.

Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala warned that “a handful of crazy people’’ were putting the city’s economic recovery at risk, and threatened to shut down the city’s trendy Navigli district after crowds of young Milanese were seen out at aperitivo hour ignoring social-distancing rules.

In Rome, the Campo dei Fiori flower and vegetable market was bustling Saturday morning, the first weekend Italians were allowed outside for more than just work and necessities. The Campo piazza, long a center of nightlife, has also come back to life at the evening aperitivo hour.

But confusion about what is now allowed and what is not created frustration for business owners.

Carlo Alberto, owner of the TabaCafe, an Argentine empanada bar that was selling cocktails to a few customers Friday, said that since reopening this week he had been threatened with a fine by the police because of the crowds that had formed in front of his bar.

“Am I supposed to send them home? They need a guard here to do that,” he said. “The laws aren’t clear, the decree isn’t clear. You don’t know what you can do.”

Elsewhere, Pakistan allowed shops, factories, construction sites and some other businesses to reopen Saturday, while more than 1,600 new cases and 24 deaths were reported. Prime Minister Imran Khan said the government is rolling back curbs because it can’t support millions of families that depend on daily wages.

The government warned that controls will be reimposed if the public fails to follow social-distancing guidelines.

Others imposed new restrictions: Kuwait, in the Middle East, announced a lockdown from Sunday through May 30.

In Spain, health authorities will allow regions that have demonstrated their hospitals are prepared to handle a second wave of infections to scale back their lockdowns.

In some areas, mostly heavily rural ones, bars and restaurants will be allowed to open up 50% of their outdoor seating on Monday, and churches, theaters and museums can also reopen with limits on attendance.

But Madrid and Barcelona, the country’s largest cities, both badly hit by the virus, will remain locked down.

“The pandemic is evolving favorably, but there is a risk of another outbreak that could generate a serious catastrophe,” Spanish health official Fernando Simón said. “Personal responsibility is vital.”

The outbreak forced Russian President Vladimir Putin to mark Victory Day without the usual pomp of a military parade in Moscow’s Red Square.

This year’s observance had been expected to be especially large because it is the 75th anniversary. Instead, Putin laid flowers at the tomb of the unknown soldier, and a show of military might was limited to a flyover of 75 warplanes and helicopters.

Belarus, though, held a military parade in front of big crowds in the capital, Minsk, despite sharply rising coronavirus infections. Belarus has not imposed restrictions to halt the virus’ spread, and authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko has dismissed concerns about it as a “psychosis.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

He was 75.

Horn died of complications from the coronavirus on Friday in a Las Vegas hospital, according to a statement released by publicist Dave Kirvin.

“Today, the world has lost one of the greats of magic, but I have lost my best friend,” Siegfried Fischbacher said in the statement. “From the moment we met, I knew Roy and I, together, would change the world. There could be no Siegfried without Roy, and no Roy without Siegfried.”

He was injured in October 2003 when a tiger named Montecore attacked him on stage at the Mirage hotel-casino in Las Vegas. He had severe neck injuries, lost a lot of blood and later suffered a stroke. He underwent lengthy rehabilitation, but the attack ended the long-running Las Vegas Strip production.

The darker-haired of the flashy duo, Horn was credited with the idea of introducing an exotic animal — his pet cheetah — to the magic act.

“Roy was a fighter his whole life including during these final days,” Fischbacher said. “I give my heartfelt appreciation to the team of doctors, nurses and staff at Mountain View Hospital who worked heroically against this insidious virus that ultimately took Roy’s life.”

The two became an institution in Las Vegas, where their magic and artistry consistently attracted sellout crowds. The pair performed six shows a week, 44 weeks per year.

They returned to the stage in February 2009 for what was billed as their one and only comeback performance, to raise funds for the new Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas. The brief performance, which included Montecore, became the basis of an episode of the ABC television show “20/20.”

Horn and Siegfried Fischbacher, both natives of Germany, had first teamed up in 1957 and made their Las Vegas debut a decade later. Siegfried & Roy began performing at the Mirage in 1990.

When they signed a lifetime contract with the Mirage in 2001, it was estimated they had performed 5,000 shows at the casino for 10 million fans since 1990 and had grossed more than $1 billion. That comes on top of thousands of shows at other venues in earlier years.

“Throughout the history of Las Vegas, no artists have meant more to the development of Las Vegas’ global reputation as the entertainment capital of the world than Siegfried and Roy,” Terry Lanni, chairman of MGM Mirage, the casino’s parent company, said after the attack.

The pair gained international recognition for helping to save rare white tigers and white lions from extinction. Their $10 million compound was home to dozens of rare animals over the years. The white lions and white tigers were the result of a preservation program that began in the 1980s.

“The good news is that the white tigers and white lions are going into the 21st century,” Horn said in a 1999 interview with The Associated Press. “The bad news is that if we don’t do something about the tigers in the wild, they will disappear.”

Siegfried & Roy’s show, incorporating animal antics and magic tricks, included about 20 white tigers and lions, the number varying depending on the night. The show also had other exotic animals, including an elephant.

“Their show is so fast-paced the viewer has time only to gasp before the next dazzlement,” an Associated Press reviewer wrote in 1989 when they brought their act to New York.

“A white car drives on stage — as Liberace used to do — bringing a mother white tiger and three cubs. Roy rides an elephant, which disappears, then reappears. At the end, a 650-pound white tiger climbs atop a globe. With Roy on his back, they’re pulled into the air.”

“It’s a Las Vegas show and it’s nonstop entertainment. New Yorkers aren’t too sophisticated for this.”

A later spectacular developed for the Mirage opened with a flashy “Star Wars” scenario and Horn and Fischbacher arriving in their own mini space capsules. Another segment had Horn sitting atop a 30-foot (9.1-meter) pyramid that was “destroyed” by an explosion and fire, leaving him levitated high above the stage.

It was halfway during a performance Oct. 3, 2003, when Horn was alone on stage with the tiger that it suddenly lunged at him.

Horn, who had turned 59 that day, had never been injured during a show before, “not a scratch, not by an animal,” Bernie Yuman, the pair’s longtime manager, said at the time.

He said he thought Montecore, a 7-year-old male, got distracted by something in the audience and Horn was trying to calm him. Horn himself said later that he fainted and the tiger was trying to help him by dragging him offstage, though animal experts disputed that possibility.

An investigation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture explored a variety of theories but was unable to reach a conclusion on what caused the tiger to attack. In its final report, the USDA also said the show’s producers had failed to protect the audience because there was no barrier separating the exotic animals from the crowd.

In October 2006, three years after the attack, Horn and Fischbacher attended their induction into the Las Vegas Walk of Stars. Horn’s speech was sluggish at times and he walked a bit slow, but he called the event “a deeply emotional experience.”

Born in Nordenham, Germany, Horn met Fischbacher on a cruise ship in 1957. Fischbacher performed the magic tricks, while Horn became his assistant, eventually suggesting using the cheetah in the act.

They honed their animal-magic show in small clubs in Germany and Switzerland in the mid-1960s. Their break came in a Monte Carlo casino when an agent in the audience invited them to Las Vegas. The pair made their debut at the Tropicana hotel-casino in the late 1960s.

The illusionists became popular in the 1970s, receiving their first star billing in 1978 as headliners of the Stardust’s “Lido de Paris.” Their show “Beyond Belief” opened in 1981 at the Frontier and played to thousands over seven years.

When Horn and Fischbacher became U.S. citizens in 1988, an elated Horn said, “Being an American means all the things we believe in.”

Horn once hand-fed a white lion cub born prematurely, starting with an eyedropper. But when a cub was donated to a zoo, Horn said he was heartbroken.

“When you love something, the hardest thing is to let it go,” he said. “But this is what Siegfried and Roy do. We live our dreams, and we fulfill our destiny.”

President Donald Trump, who publicly identified the affected Pence aide, said he was “not worried” about the virus spreading in the White House. Nonetheless, officials said they were stepping up safety protocols for the complex.

Pence spokeswoman Katie Miller, who tested positive Friday, had been in recent contact with Pence but not with the president. She is married to Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser. The White House had no immediate comment on whether Stephen Miller had been tested or if he was still working out of the White House.

Katie Miller had tested negative Thursday, a day before her positive result.

“This is why the whole concept of tests aren’t necessarily great,” Trump said. “The tests are perfect but something can happen between a test where it’s good and then something happens.”

The positive test for the senior Pence aide came one day after White House officials confirmed that a member of the military serving as one of Trump’s valets had tested positive for COVID-19.

Six people who had been in contact with Miller were scheduled to fly with Pence on Friday to Des Moines, Iowa, on Air Force Two. They were removed from the flight just before it took off, according to a senior administration official.

None of those people were exhibiting symptoms, but were asked to deplane so they could be tested “out of an abundance of caution,” a senior administration official told reporters traveling with Pence. All six later tested negative, the White House said.

The official said staff in the West Wing are tested regularly but much of Pence’s staff — which works next door in the Executive Office Building — are tested less frequently. Katie Miller was not on the plane and had not been scheduled to be on the trip.

Pence, who is tested on a regular basis, was tested Friday.

White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said the administration was stepping up mitigation efforts already recommended by public health experts and taking other unspecified precautions to ensure the safety of the president.

Meadows said the White House was “probably the safest place that you can come,” but he was reviewing further steps to keep Trump and Pence safe.

The White House requires daily temperature checks of anyone who enters the White House complex and has encouraged social distancing among those working in the building. The administration has also directed regular deep cleaning of all work spaces. Anyone who comes in close proximity to the president and vice president is tested daily for COVID-19.

“We’ve already put in a few protocols that we’re looking at, obviously, to make sure that the president and his immediate staff stay safe. But it’s not just the president, it’s all the workers that are here ... on a daily basis,” Meadows said.

Trump’s valet’s case marked the first known instance where a person who has come in close proximity to the president has tested positive since several people present at his private Florida club were diagnosed with COVID-19 in early March. The valet tested positive Wednesday.

The White House was moving to shore up its protection protocols to protect the nation’s political leaders. Trump said some staffers who interact with him closely would now be tested daily. Pence told reporters Thursday that both he and Trump would now be tested daily as well.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The syndrome presents symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome, including rash, persistent fever, vomiting, diarrhea, red eyes, swollen lymph nodes and abdominal problems. The Chicago area case was confirmed at Advocate Children’s Hospital, though it’s unclear whether the child is being treated at the Oak Lawn or Park Ridge campus.

“This appears to be a very complex complication of COVID-19,” said Dr. Frank Belmonte, the hospital’s chief medical officer. “We are currently learning new things about this virus every day. This is the first indication that children may be more negatively impacted than we first expected.”

The mysterious sickness was first identified in children in Europe and is now beginning to crop up in the United States, according to a statement from Advocate, which noted that the illness has affected “children as young as two and well into the teens.”

In New York, public health officials have identified 64 children with symptoms consistent with the illness. A bulletin issued Monday warned that diagnostic testing for COVID-19 could come back positive or negative and that cases may require both cardiac and respiratory support.

“Early diagnosis and treatment are essential,” said Belmonte. “If you have questions, you’ll want to call your pediatrician, or in more serious cases, go to a pediatric emergency department.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

“Recognizing the disproportionate burden of the COVID-19 pandemic to our employees who provide patient care in our hospitals and emergency departments, [Northwestern] will initiate a special compensation program, retroactive to April 5, 2020, through the lifting of the Illinois stay-at-home order or such other time as [Northwestern] determines it is no longer required,” Dean Harrison wrote April 17.

But on Thursday, a day before employees were set to receive their first paychecks with the extra cash, some received another email from an administrator explaining that they were now deemed ineligible for the program. Employees who mostly deal with inpatients still qualify for the bonuses, though workers “that spend the majority of their time with patients coming in for outpatient procedures are not eligible,” according to the email obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times.

While those employees would still receive a bump in pay Friday, the email made it clear that the money would eventually be clawed back by their employer.

An employee at a suburban hospital, who asked to remain anonymous fearing she may be fired for speaking out, said she and her co-workers believe they’re set to receive an extra $5 an hour in their paychecks on Friday. Nevertheless, the money will now be taken out of her next check on May 22.

“It’s like giving a kid a piece of candy, and just as they start to put it in their mouth, you’re just ripping it out of their hands,” said the worker. “It is very cruel. It’s unbelievable.”

She was among the employees caught off guard by Thursday’s email from Sara Williamson, Northwestern’s director of access, who wrote that hospital officials “have come to understand that a smaller population of our team qualifies than what we originally thought.”

“I feel very strongly that this does not reflect your work efforts during this time, your contributions to the organization or my appreciation of your work,” she wrote. “Rather, this is something we need to do to ensure we are applying these pay practices in an equitable way across the organization.”

“There is extraordinary work going on that we may not be recognizing in a monetary way, but a lot of thought continues to go on about how we can continue to recognize all of [the] work and efforts during this time.”

Chris King, a spokesman for Northwestern, blamed payroll errors caused by “the expedited implementation process and interpretations of the qualification guidelines.”

“As always, we will follow up directly with the employees impacted,” King said. “We are proud of the exceptional work happening every day across our health system to care for patients during this global pandemic.

Meanwhile, the suburban hospital employee was still seething.

That old trickster, God. He does have His mysterious ways, doesn’t He? Setting the lives of millions on fire, just so we fortunate few can enjoy the warm glow and toast marshmallows on their burning homes.

Unlimbering the rhetorical bazooka I always keep conveniently slung over my shoulder, I squinted into the gunsight, seeing the tiny figure of my neighbor, smiling over her freshly-coined public wisdom. My finger tensed.

Then I sighed, lowered my weapon, and decided to demonstrate my wit and humanity in a novel fashion: by saying nothing.

Sure, I could have archly pointed out that hiding in the basement could be fun, provided you have a comfortable, well-stocked basement. But not everybody does. These are excruciatingly tough times, and if the scythe hasn’t swung in your direction, yet, the least you can do is not crow about it.

But you can’t scold a joyful person into silent gratitude. Just as you can’t shame a sad one into abandoning their sorrow as insignificant. It’s graduation time. My neighborhood is festooned with college flags, congratulatory signs, balloons, big orange and blue Illini I’s painted on lawns. Online, bursts of milestone festivity, shadowed with a definite sense of loss. No commencement. No prom. It’s not fair! After seeing a few, I considered creating a meme: a soft sepia passport photo of Anne Frank, with the tagline, “Not every teen got to go to prom.” That’ll show ‘em. Think of the retweets! Dozens!

I also held that back. I’m not the coronavirus mullah, wandering cyberspace in my long white beard and black robes, taking a reed switch to the legs of anybody who dares be too happy or too sad. I don’t want to show up at the virtual wake for high school life and castigate the mourners.

People should be allowed their joys and sorrows without strangers whipping out a tape measure. And if they celebrate or mourn a bit too much, well, maybe the sin of pointing it out is worse than either supposed wrong that’s being reprimanded. When the boys were small, and the cat knocked over the younger one’s goldfish bowl, I didn’t harangue him about The Six Million. I dried his tears and presided over the toilet-bowl-side funeral service. It was his fish and he loved it.

Here is the deep, rare and hard-won insight I’ve discovered and want to share, because I find it useful during this crisis, as useful as hand sanitizer: it isn’t all about me. Or you. If you want a clear picture of what it’s like not to grasp this, look to our president. His life teaches many things, but the central lesson is the corrosive power of ego. Ego poisons. It ruins everything, and the more you make every situation about yourself, the worse your life will be. You can be president of the United States, rich, famous, and beloved, in certain quarters, but if you can’t sympathize with anyone, can’t perceive people who are not yourself. then you’re pathetic.

I was griping to a friend last month about the difficulties of living with two men in their early 20s, law students whose schools are closed, who now spend all day lounging around my house, learning to argue incisively when a bell rings. Young men who, I discovered to my surprise and horror, seem to have been raised by a sharp-tongued, not-always-kind individual. Guys who don’t hop to their feet whenever their father shuffles into the room, nor exhibit kindness, or even attention, should he speak.

I expected her to sympathize. She did, but not with me.

“Imagine how hard this must be for them,” my friend Barbara said. “Yanked out of their schools, apart from their friends, stuck with their parents.”

Well .... yeah ... there is that.

Though originally designed to help monitor the recovery of stroke patients, researchers realized it could be used to measure the vibratory signatures of coronavirus symptoms.

Everyone in Illinois can help make it happen. But Gov. J.B. Pritzker needs to make a call first.

Raskar, a former Google and Facebook technologist who holds nearly 100 patents, heads a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that has developed a digital contact tracing app called PrivateKit: SafePaths. It’s available free from the iPhone and Android app stores.

Contact tracing is essential to stopping COVID-19. It’s one of what Pritzker calls the “three T’s” — testing, tracing and treatment. The head of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says we need to do it.

Traditional contact tracing is slow and tedious. When someone tests positive for a dangerous virus, you find out everyone they’ve been in contact with for as long as they’ve been contagious — in COVID-19’s case, at least 14 days.

Then, you track down those people, test them, quarantine the infected ones and trace their contacts. Once everyone with the disease has been identified and isolated, the pandemic stops.

Traditional contact tracing is practical only in the early days of an outbreak, when few people have been infected. In most of the United States, we’re long past that point.

If everyone cooperates with the stay-at-home order, though, and the COVID-19 caseload drops, eventually contact tracing becomes doable again.

Just one problem. Researchers at Oxford University have found that because COVID-19 is transmitted so easily — many with the disease are contagious for a week before they show symptoms, and some never get symptoms at all — contact tracing has to be almost instantaneous to do any good. If it takes days, that’s too late.

Digital technology using smartphones makes instant contact tracing possible. As I previously wrote, China and South Korea successfully used it to control the pandemic.

But the technology can be intrusive. In China, people must have software installed on their phones that tracks their every move — useful when you’re trying to stamp out a pandemic but also handy for controlling the masses.

South Korea isn’t that bad, but the emergency alerts it beams out when someone tests positive for the coronavirus sometimes go into creepy detail about the patient’s travels — reportedly including an overnight excursion to a “love motel.”

The PrivateKit app that Raskar and his team have developed sidesteps such problems. It uses Bluetooth technology to record any close encounters you have with other PrivateKit users plus GPS location data to create a diary of your daily travels.

The diary is encrypted and lives only on your phone. If you test positive for COVID-19, you can — if you choose — turn your diary over to public health officials. They use software to scrub any details that identify you personally and load the result into a database.

Then they click on a button. An alert is sent instantly to every PrivateKit user with whom you came into contact in the past 14 days, telling them they could be at risk and providing instructions.

That’s it. No details about you.

Now suppose that before you tested positive you inadvertently came into contact with Jack, who hadn’t downloaded the PrivateKit app. The encounter wasn’t recorded in your diary, but your path was.

The day after you test positive, Jack downloads the app and has it check for COVID-19 contacts. The app searches the database, finds out Jack crossed paths with you and pops up an alert.

But wait, what if Jack never downloads the app or doesn’t even have a phone? If he comes down with COVID-19, how will health authorities know he got it from me?

They’ll figure it out the old-fashioned way with digital assistance. They’ll painstakingly ask Jack to recall his travels and load the information into the database. The software will do a search and, you’d hope, establish that Jack crossed paths with you.

It might not always work. But if mostly it does, and most COVID-19 carriers can be identified and isolated, the pandemic will peter out.

You’re thinking: This sounds like a long shot. Why bother?

Two reasons. One is to protect yourself. The other is to protect your family and friends.

At some point, stay-at-home restrictions will have to be eased, and people will start going back to work or school. Large gatherings will likely continue to be prohibited, but some semblance of normal activity must resume for the economy to start up again. And people will want to hang out, play sports, attend weddings, visit their elderly parents and generally get back to having a life.

Wouldn’t you want to protect those people? If you go to a party and later test positive for COVID-19, wouldn’t you want the attendees to know? If someone else at the party gets the disease, wouldn’t you want to be told?

That’s what PrivateKit does. If I go to any social gatherings or work meetings, I’ll want the app on my phone, and I’m not walking in unless everybody else has it, too.

Lots of people need to use the app to get the pandemic under control. Christophe Fraser, a co-author of the Oxford study, told me the adoption rate has be roughly 60%. Fat chance we’ll get the whole country to that level. It’ll be tough enough in Illinois.

So what? The app will help even if adoption is a lot less.

“Every life we save matters,” Raskar says. “I’d be happy to eliminate one case and prevent one elderly person from being exposed.”

None of this is possible without the support of local authorities. They need the software to enter the diaries of COVID-19 patients into the database, and medical personnel have to be trained in how to use it. An administrative infrastructure has to be set up to make the whole thing work.

A huge team isn’t needed. Raskar estimates it would take 300 people statewide, plus additional staff to do traditional contact tracing as a backup. He’s working with 20 jurisdictions around the country. He says Illinois could — and should — be the first to start.

Pritzker understands the importance of contact tracing. When I asked him at his briefing Thursday whether he was considering a contact tracing program, he responded enthusiastically.

Governor, please call Raskar and have him explain the technology and how it would be implemented. He’s got the best plan I’ve heard of for getting us past this nightmare.

Digital contact tracing worked in Asia. We can — and need — to do it here.

Singapore has introduced a mobile phone app to aid in contact tracing, for centuries the cornerstone of stopping epidemics, and says it will make the code available at no charge.

European nations have announced multiple initiatives to develop their own virus-fighting apps and other technology, some of them based on the Singapore model.

In the United States, though, we’re doing little to harness technology to defeat the pandemic, and we don’t seem to have a plan for controlling the virus other than keeping people home, doing more testing, and eventually coming up with a vaccine. What gives?

Dr. Richard Cooper, chair of the Health Sciences Department at the Parkinson School of Health Sciences and Public Health at Loyola University Chicago, says he’s mystified. “The U.S. invented the smartphone,” he says. “That’s exactly the kind of thing that could be leveraged. Other countries are way ahead of us.”

The stakes couldn’t be higher. Social distancing and stay-at-home orders in much of the country have bought us essential time, at the cost of crippling the economy.

We can’t stay home indefinitely. But if we go back to business without rigorous measures to contain the coronavirus, the pandemic will start up all over again. As bad as the current outbreak may be, another one is likely next fall or early winter, as Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has warned.

A recent Harvard study suggests that without aggressive contact tracing and quarantining, the only way to control COVID-19 may be a strategy of intermittent lockdowns alternating with renewed outbreaks until “herd immunity” is built up, prolonging the pandemic into 2022 and resulting in thousands of unnecessary deaths.

“That’s not a price anybody should consider paying,” Cooper says. “Contact tracing is one of the right and necessary things to do. You can’t just throw up your hands and say we have too many cases.”

Contact tracing and technology aren’t the only steps needed to prevent the pandemic from resuming once the initial outbreak is under control. Based on conversations with experts plus other research, here’s what I understand must be done before the stay-at-home order can be safely lifted.

Mass testing

Two types of tests are needed. The first is on-demand virus testing to determine if you’re infected with COVID-19 now.

The expert consensus is that Illinois needs to be able to administer at least 4,000 tests per day, about the same as South Korea did per capita during its successful campaign to halt the pandemic. Gov. J.B. Pritzker says the state has reached this level, although days-long delays in obtaining results remain a problem. The governor says he expects testing capacity to reach 10,000 per day by next week.

We need 10,000 tests a day in Illinois to get a better handle on how well the stay-at-home order is working — that’s the major intervention so far. The ultimate goal is to test everyone who needs a test on a regular basis.

The second type of test screens for blood antibodies to determine if you’ve ever had COVID-19, even if you’ve now recovered. The Food and Drug Administration has said it authorized use of a blood test made by Cellex Inc. Wide availability of such a test would likely take time.

Those who have recovered from COVID-19 are thought to be immune to the disease, at least temporarily, and could return to work or volunteer for emergency services. Knowing how much of the population has had COVID-19 would be valuable in determining measures to combat the virus.

Contact tracing

Contact tracing requires tracking down everyone known to have had contact with a COVID-19 patient in the past 14 days and testing them for the virus. The goal is to discover the “index case” — the first person who brought the disease into the community — and then trace out all subsequent links in the chain of transmission.

Traditional contact tracing is labor-intensive — “shoe leather epidemiology,” says Dr. Bala Hota, vice-president and chief analytics officer at Rush University Medical Center. It’s impractical once the virus is widespread, but becomes feasible again if the stay-at-home order works and the initial outbreak subsides.

“It would be really interesting to use technology” to eliminate some of the legwork, Hota says.

TraceTogether, a mobile app recently introduced in Singapore, uses Bluetooth technology to detect nearby phones that also have the app installed. To allay privacy concerns, records of contacts are encrypted and stored locally on the user’s phone, not sent to a central database. The app’s opening screen is shown in the illustration.

If a TraceTogether user becomes infected, public health authorities download and decrypt the data with the user’s permission and call close contacts, telling them to get tested.

Using the app is voluntary, but the public has a strong incentive to do so — they’re protecting their family, friends and fellow citizens, and are notified themselves if they come into contact with the virus. The app was launched on March 20 and now has 950,000 users, a Singapore government website says.

Singapore authorities have said they will make the code for the TraceTogether app available to software developers at no charge. European authorities are investigating a similar approach that will meet the European Union’s stringent privacy regulations.

Even if contact tracing technology comes into wide use, a sizable staff will be needed to call contacts and track down cases that slip through the cracks. A World Health Organization report on the coronavirus response in China found that 1,800 teams of at least five people each traced tens of thousands of contacts per day to help control the outbreak in Wuhan.

“We need to massively gear up the capacity to do contact tracing and surveillance,” Cooper says. “We need training and a command center to manage people.”

Quarantine

People testing positive for COVID-19 must be isolated while contagious. The same is true of visitors from other regions where the virus remains uncontrolled.

Most COVID-19 patients don’t require hospitalization and can self-quarantine on their own. Technology can be used to ensure compliance.

South Korea requires new arrivals to that country to submit to a 14-day quarantine that is monitored by a mandatory smartphone app that tracks their location. University of Illinois engineering grad Ryan Shin, now a tech entrepreneur in Seoul, provided a screenshot of the Korean quarantine tracking app, shown in the accompanying illustration.

Each quarantined individual is assigned a case officer, whose number must be entered into the app. Users are asked to report any symptoms; those who become seriously ill are taken to a hospital.

The app tracks the user’s location. If the system detects that a user has left quarantine, an alarm is sent to the case officer. Quarantine violators are taken into custody, Shin says.

Travel restrictions

Once the virus is under control locally, steps must be taken to prevent visitors from re-introducing the disease. This will require a range of measures both regionally and nationally.

International visitors may need to be quarantined, as in Korea, or given results-while-you-wait virus testing once kits become widely available.

The United Kingdom and Germany are considering “immunity passports” that would allow those who’ve recovered from COVID-19 to bypass restrictions.

Regional restrictions also will be needed within the U.S. to permit normal life to resume in areas where the virus is under control while preventing an influx of visitors from hot spots. In China, authorities set up roadblocks around Wuhan to prevent travel, an approach not likely to fly in the U.S.

In Chicago, an added complication is that the metropolitan area sprawls across three states, with commuters arriving in the Loop daily by train and car from Wisconsin and Indiana. To minimize checkpoints and delays, it may be necessary for the three states to jointly establish a regional pass system or the like until the crisis is over.

In the absence of national guidance, state and local governments will need to figure such things out on their own.

“Ideally what we need is a single plan that every country follows, but that’s not going to happen,” Cooper says. “Regional action could be effective — it obviously helps. Anything we can do, we should do.”

We have till the end of the stay-at-home order — currently set to expire April 30 — to implement a workable plan to prevent COVID-19 from returning. We’d better get on it.

Right now, bank on mid-April — at the earliest.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order, which took effect on Saturday, March 21, is set to expire on Tuesday, April 7.

Expect the governor to extend that. Mayor Lori Lightfoot predicted Friday Pritzker would push the order “deep into April,” though Pritzker afterward was non-committal.

Three Chicago medical experts who have been monitoring the situation agree that state public health officials need a minimum of four weeks to make sure that all existing cases of COVID-19 infection in Illinois have been identified and isolated.

Based on the start of Pritzker’s order, that would take the date to Saturday, April 18. Even then, a host of factors could push things back, including the degree to which people can be tested and how full hospitals get.

The experts with whom I spoke are Dr. Bala Hota, an epidemiologist who is vice president and chief analytics officer at Rush University Medical Center; Dr. Elaine Morrato, founding dean of the Parkinson School of Health Sciences and Public Health at Loyola University Chicago, and Dr. Robert Murphy, director of the Institute for Global Health and Center for Global Communicable Diseases at Northwestern Medicine.

While they can’t predict for certain when the outbreak will be under control in Illinois, they do agree on this: Lifting the stay-at-home order should not happen on an arbitrary date such as Easter (April 12), as President Donald Trump has suggested.

COVID-19 symptoms typically do not become apparent until 5 to 7 days after exposure, Hota said. Severe cases on average require hospitalization after an additional 5 to 7 days. Seriously ill patients may remain contagious for longer still.

Criteria for Pritzker lifting the order should include statewide availability of on-demand COVID-19 testing, the experts agreed. There should also be — at minimum — a decline in the rate of increase in daily new cases. Murphy said the number of daily new cases should show a steady downward trend before stay-at-home restrictions are eased.

Another important consideration is how close hospitals are to capacity, Hota said. If the health care system becomes so overloaded that patients do not receive adequate care, more deaths will result from all causes, not just COVID-19.

On-demand COVID-19 testing would require the ability to test at least 4,000 people per day statewide, Murphy said. That’s comparable to the number of tests given per capita in South Korea during the peak of its successful effort to tame the outbreak. The South Korean approach is considered the gold standard for COVID-19 control.

The other experts agreed 4,000 tests per day was a reasonable target.

Pritzker said that, as of March 24, Illinois had the ability to test 2,000 people per day, but expected to be able to test 4,300 per day within two weeks.

As of Saturday evening, Illinois had recorded 3,491 COVID-19 cases, the eighth highest total for any state, including 465 new cases. On average, the number of daily new cases is doubling every three days, Illinois Department of Public Health figures indicate. New cases have been rising sharply since March 9.

In South Korea, new cases rose sharply starting on Feb. 19 and began declining on March 8 — 19 days later, according to data from Worldometer, an international statistics website.

South Korea was able to control the COVID-19 outbreak in a relatively short time because it had ample infrastructure in place due to experience with mini-epidemics such as the 2003 SARS outbreak, Murphy said. South Korea tested up to 20,000 people per day at the height of the coronavirus crisis there.

It also instituted rigorous “contact tracing,” identifying and testing everyone whom infected people had come in contact with through a combination of detective work and technology.

Some public health experts and technologists in the U.S. and other countries advocate the use of smartphone applications and other advanced tools to aid in contact tracing.

South Korea uses a special text messaging service that must be installed on all smartphones sold in that country. If someone tests positive for COVID-19, their path through the community is traced based on information provided by the patient plus credit card transaction location data and security camera video obtained with the patient’s permission.

South Korean authorities have the authority to obtain a patient’s smartphone location data but don’t invoke this unless the patient refuses to cooperate, Ryan Shin, a South Korean who lives and works in Seoul, said in an email. Shin, who graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with an engineering degree in 2012, is CEO of a Korean tech startup.

The service then broadcasts a “safety guidance message” to the phones of all who live in the patient’s neighborhood. The alert overrides other activity on the phone and displays the message accompanied by an audible alarm.

Recipients click on a link to access a page listing the patient’s activities. Shin provided a typical page, shown in the accompanying illustration.

“It says on March 21 she landed at Incheon Airport at 4:30 p.m., took a bus, and rode the elevator in a certain building with a mask on,” Shin said. “On March 22 she went to the hospital for a virus test and then went to the supermarket.”

South Koreans who become ill can use a different smartphone app or visit a website to report their symptoms to a central office, Shin said. The senders receive instructions based on the severity of their symptoms.

Smartphone apps have been developed in other countries to perform similar functions. For example, an app introduced in Singapore uses Bluetooth technology to detect other people’s phones nearby. If a phone owner tests positive for COVID-19, authorities can use the data recorded on the phone to contact others with whom the patient has crossed paths.

The Chicago experts had varying opinions about whether such technology would gain acceptance in this country.

“I never heard of anybody doing it in the U.S.,” Murphy said. “There are a lot of privacy issues. I can’t imagine it happening here.”

“It’s worth exploring,” Morrato said. “It seems like a natural extension of things going on in the private sector that could be redeployed for surveillance. But we need evidence it will make a difference in saving lives as we consider the ethical implications.”

What should happen after the Illinois stay-at-home order is lifted is a matter of debate.

Once COVID-19 is under control in Illinois, it likely will still be raging elsewhere and could easily be reintroduced by visitors. This has occurred in some Asian countries that relaxed restrictions, the experts noted.

Regardless, the U.S. needs to rethink how it deals with pandemics. COVID-19 won’t be the last, the experts agreed.

“It’s not a question of if but when,” Morrato said.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act enabled the IRS to hand out $1,200 to Americans earning up to $75,000 a year, $2,400 to married couples who jointly file and make less than $150,000 year, and another $500 for every child under the age of 17.

But the payments can only go to taxpayers who have a Social Security number, leaving so-called “mixed-status” families behind. An exception was made for military families.

Chicago immigration attorneys Lana Nassar and Vivian Khalaf have filed a federal lawsuit in the Northern District of Illinois on behalf of an unnamed man who didn’t receive a stimulus check because he filed taxes with a spouse without a Social Security number.

Nassar and Khalaf seek class action status to include an estimated 1.2 million Americans who are married to immigrants who lack Social Security numbers and their citizen children.

About 6,000 citizens have signed up to become part of the case, including more than 1,500 in Illinois, Khalaf said during a virtual news conference Tuesday.

“There are many things in the law that are in the gray area. This is black and white. This is a constitutional violation of United States citizens,” Nassar said.

The news conference was organized by members of the Illinois congressional delegation.

U.S. Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, D-Ill., said the CARES Act excluded more than 3,700 Illinois families from receiving a stimulus check. “No one should be discriminated against for who they chose to marry [and] no child should be deprived of the financial aid they need during the pandemic. Doing so is cruel and inhumane,” he said.

“This is not just a Latinx issue,” said Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill. “There are U.S. citizens that are married to immigrants from countries all over the world. Right now, we are talking about an issue about basic fairness, plain and simple,” she said.

Communities in the Chicago area with high numbers of immigrants like Cicero, Little Village and Belmont Cragin have also recorded high numbers of COVID-19 cases.

“I don’t believe in issuing mandates and not giving people the tools to be compliant. So as a city, we will be stepping up and making sure that our residents have the kind of face-coverings that they need to be able to protect themselves when they go outside of their home and can’t safely social distance — for example, at grocery stores,” the mayor said.

Starting Friday, Illinois residents will be required to wear a face covering or a mask whenever they are in public places where they cannot maintain a six-foot social distance. Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s revised stay-at-home order requires face coverings in stores and other indoor public places. It applies to “all individuals over the age of two who are able to medically tolerate” a face-covering or mask.

The revised order applies through the month of May. But Lightfoot said she expects the mask mandate to continue for months after that.

“We’re gonna be living with masks for the duration. I see that happening certainly over the course of the summer and fall and maybe even until next year before we see a vaccine go on line,” she said.

Asked about specific plans to get masks to low-income Chicagoans, the mayor said she had been “doing that all along.” But, Lightfoot said she has “heightened those efforts” through so-called “racial equity rapid response teams” dispatched to African-American neighborhoods that have borne the brunt of the coronavirus.

“We are in the process of placing an order for a million face coverings for residents. Obviously, we’re gonna put a premium on residents in need. We’re gonna be passing out [masks] to the 50 aldermen. In the interim, we’ve put masks in their hands,” she said.

Earlier this week, dozens of aldermen lined up outside the Thompson Center for medical masks distributed by millionaire businessman Willie Wilson. A candidate for the U.S. Senate, Wilson has access to masks through his medical supply business.

Wilson has also tried to sell masks to the city and state at cost. But Lightfoot has accused the former mayoral challenger who endorsed her over County Board President Toni Preckwinkle of demanding to be paid cash up front. Wilson denied that.

The mad scramble to distribute masks to Chicagoans has also spurred a handful of City Council members, led by Ald. Anthony Beale (9th), one of Lightfoot’s most outspoken critics, to propose using their treasured aldermanic menu money for masks.

Also on Thursday:

• Lightfoot said she has no plans to follow New York City’s lead by closing the CTA for a deep cleaning. She argued once again that the CTA is a lifeline for essential workers, who have no other way to get to their jobs.

• With city revenues continuing to plummet, the mayor was asked again about the possibility of furloughs or layoffs in city government.

She reiterated that city state and federal governments should be “acting as a catalyst to spur economic growth.”

She called layoffs and furloughs “demoralizing” and a “last, last, last resort. ... Well, last is raising property taxes.”

• Lightfoot gave a rare shout-out to former Mayor Rahm Emanuel for fiercely defending Chicago’s status as a sanctuary city, despite President Donald Trump’s repeated attempts to strip sanctuary cities of federal crime-fighting funds. It happened on the day when a federal appeals court affirmed earlier rulings in Chicago’s favor in that marathon court fight.

“When I got the news from our corporation counsel earlier this morning, I let out a cheer,” Lightfoot said.

“And I have to give credit to former Mayor Rahm Emanuel for really understanding the importance of fighting this fight. ... We could not be dictated to simply because we embraced who we are as a city. We embraced our immigrants and refugees.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Francisco Morales Torres has spent the past year and a half locked up at the Dodge County jail in Juneau, Wisconsin, under the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

An immigration judge in Chicago granted Morales Torres asylum in 2019 and again in February, but government prosecutors have appealed both rulings. As those appeals make their way through the courts, Morales Torres — who has anxiety, depression and other mental illnesses — is unlikely to be released from ICE custody.

His lawyers have turned to the District Court of Eastern Wisconsin to win his release, arguing his prolonged detention violates the due process clause of the Constitution and puts him at risk of contracting COVID-19.

“A lot of us in here already didn’t know when we were going to see our families again, but now with the coronavirus, there’s an added fear of dying,” Morales Torres said in a phone call from Dodge County jail Wednesday. “We don’t know what’s going on. It’s only a matter of time before something happens.”

ICE declined to comment for this story citing pending litigation.

Court records show Morales Torres came to the United States in 2007 at age 13. He entered the country without proper authorization and was later taken into ICE custody and placed in deportation proceedings in September 2018 after several run-ins with the law, including a conviction for possession of a stolen vehicle.

While in detention, Morales Torres was granted asylum by Immigration Judge Kathryn De Angelis in April 2019 based on fears of being persecuted in Mexico for his sexual orientation and because he has acute psychiatric illnesses.

Government prosecutors appealed the ruling, and the case was returned to De Angelis in October 2019.

Five months later, De Angelis again granted Morales Torres protection from deportation as “he will face a substantial risk of torture if he is removed to Mexico because of his severe mental health illnesses, his lack of familial support, and his sexual orientation,” she wrote.

Prosecutors appealed De Angelis’ second ruling, which remains pending.

Keren Zwick, one of three attorneys at the National Immigrant Justice Center working on Morales Torres’ case, said it could take more than a year before the courts get through both appeals. Zwick worries that by then the coronavirus will have reached Dodge County.

“These facilities routinely take in people from other county jails or detention centers where outbreaks of the virus have been confirmed,” she said. “Congregate settings like these are ill-equipped to handle the virus.”

As of last week, there were 30,000 immigrants in ICE custody. So far, the agency has tested 995 of them for the coronavirus and 449 tested positive, including 12 at a county jail in downstate Illinois.

Boulder, Colorado, which offered so much when my parents retired there, geez, more than 30 years ago, isn’t quite the jubilee it was. Now in their mid-80s, they aren’t charging up the trail to Wonderland Lake anymore.

It can be a frustrating conversation. Particularly when my mother is planning to go to the store. “Ma!” I’ll say. “Don’t risk your life for coconut shrimp!” Or, when that doesn’t work, “Ma! You’re going to die alone, surrounded by strangers in masks.”

Opinion

My father is sometimes watching television when I phone — CNN, thank God, not Fox — and my mother will mention something on the screen, the latest aftershock from our president’s daily twirl in the limelight, like some demented ballerina on the music box in an insecure girl’s nightmare.

“Don’t watch TV news, Mom,” I’ll say. “I never do.”

That’s true. Primarily because I read newspapers and follow events online, so anything on TV is repetitive. Even big breaking stories — the last time I fled to TV news was when Notre Dame burned. After 10 minutes of time-filling and tap-dancing, I bailed. What’s the point? As for the president’s daily 5 p.m. nervous breakdown ... “Fortunate the person,” Soren Kierkegaard writes, “who did not need to travel to hell in order to see what the devil looks like.”

People who do make that journey, the daily descent, feel obligated to react. This has gone on years, and I’m sorry, but by now those doing so seem merely slow on the uptake. “What? You’re saying that the president is lying?!? Oh, my gosh, that’s awful! When did he start doing that?”

And yet. Sometimes, you must join in. State the obvious. For The Record. Yes, there is something OCD about keeping track of the president’s lies. Maybe it’s like baseball; to ignore even one wild pitch is to lose the fabric of the game. I understand that. Was that a strike or a ball? Hard to determine the next day. You have to pay attention now. Though I bet journalists wish they had decided to keep track of his true statements — a much shorter list.

To the matter at hand.

On Monday, he — no need to speak the name — tweeted this:

“In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens. I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!”

“The Invisible Enemy.” He means the virus, right? Though you can’t be certain, can you?

Three of my four grandparents were immigrants. Maybe yours, too. If they weren’t, then somebody further down the line was. And when those people came over, be they Jewish or Italian, South American or Somalian, you know the riffraff on the pier fancied themselves as better, smarter, worthier, real Americans, because they were here already.

The old lie. His ace reliever. The horse he rode in on: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” His “Look! A squirrel!” fastball. The dogs always go for it, swinging at the heels. Whenever the president has made a botch job of something — and, man, is this a botch — he winds up, lets loose “build the wall” and his followers rush off, tongues lolling.

The good news is his bad idea immediately got watered down, as it often does. By Wednesday, it was nearly meaningless, just another unwelcome fumble at Lady Liberty’s crotch. By Friday, it’ll be nearly forgotten, replaced by a dozen other doozies and head-scratchers, contradictions, excesses, whoppers and jaw-droppers.

I’m not saying ignore the news. With 45,000 Americans dead since Valentine’s Day, and another 45,000 to die, easy, by Fourth of July, that would be irresponsible.

But I recommend a conscious program of distraction. Take your news, then take a break. Wednesday, I got my hands on an advance copy of an upcoming book about Jeanne Gang, the rock star Chicago architect, and her Studio Gang. I immediately began reading — to give you a full accounting before its publication date in June, but also to go somewhere else for a little while. This year, 2020, will always be the year of COVID-19. But 2020 will also be the year Gang’s 101-story Vista Tower opens. Cold comfort, but comfort nonetheless.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said Friday Democrats should pull the plug on their national convention in Milwaukee, already pushed back to August because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and hold a virtual event instead to officially tap Joe Biden as their presidential nominee.

In a telephone interview with the Chicago Sun-Times, Durbin discussed the coronavirus crisis as the nation faces another week under stay-at-home orders.

Lockdown life

Durbin’s been working out of his Springfield home the past three weeks. Congress is on recess to avoid spreading COVID-19. He wears jeans, khakis and sweats most of the time.

Durbin started putting on a mask the past few days and says he feels like a bandit going into a store. He goes to his office for Facebook sessions with Illinoisans because the internet connection is better. Durbin and wife Loretta order take-out often to support local restaurants.

Small Business Administration loans: Sees controversy on the horizon

On Thursday, after just two weeks, a stampede of applicants exhausted a new $346 billion Paycheck Protection Program appropriation. The PPP is designed to help employers meet payrolls, pay some operating costs and have the loan forgiven.

Durbin said shoveling so much money out the door so fast means “the day we take a look at the loans that were given and the loans that were turned down, there’s going to be a controversy, I’m just sure of that.”

Democrats and Republicans agree about pouring another $250 billion into the PPP pot, though Democrats want some changes to fix what appear to be inequities in loan approvals. “We definitely need it,” Durbin said. A key issue for Democrats is to make sure a portion the second round of PPP loans go to minority-owned businesses squeezed out of the first round of PPP because they did not have strong relationships with lenders, who gave priority to their best customers.

Durbin also wants more transparency. He is concerned, he said, that “companies that suffered no losses because of this COVID are still qualifying for substantial forgivable loans.”

Milwaukee convention

Asked about the national convention, Durbin said: “I think it will be a virtual convention. I think the likelihood that we’ll be able to assemble any kind of crowds, whether it’s for a convention or for a football game or a baseball game is really at this point highly unlikely” until “we have a vaccine that is effective and widely distributed.”

Earlier this month, the Democratic National Committee postponed its presidential nominating convention to Aug. 17. The gathering at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee originally had been scheduled for July 13-16. The GOP convention is set for Aug 24-27 at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, N.C.

“God bless the people of Milwaukee. We’ll have a big party up there with bratwurst at some later date but I just don’t think it’s practical to ask people to travel from all over the United States to gather in a large crowded group,” Durbin said.

On joining Trump’s Opening Up America Again Congressional Group

Durbin was on a call with President Donald Trump and many other senators Thursday for this newly created White House group that is without — so far — a specific agenda. He said he urged that state and local governments get substantial financial assistance in the next round of emergency funding; that issue is part of the debate over extending the PPP.

Durbin, founder of the movement to legalize the status of “Dreamers,” people brought to the U.S. illegally while underage, said he asked Trump to avoid deportation threats during the COVID-19 emergency. Trump yanked Dreamers’ legal protections, and a case protesting his action is pending in the Supreme Court.

Trump “says what he always says,” said Durbin, who has been to this rodeo with the president before. Trump, according to Durbin, said: “‘We are going to take care of those young people, don’t worry about that.’ He told me that the day he was sworn in, and we know what has happened since. He didn’t do what he said.”",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

“While we are not going to share the details of any specific child in our care, there have been 37 confirmed positive diagnoses to date,” Heartland Alliance spokeswoman Mailee Garcia said.

“We are operating under the assumption that we will see additional positive diagnoses as we receive results from the other tests that have been administered, and the steps we are taking to ensure the health and safety of our participants and staff are based on that assumption.”

Garcia said the prognosis for the children “is very good,” adding that the nonprofit “aggressively moved to obtain testing for all of the children in our care — even those who are asymptomatic.”

Heartland Alliance operates three dormitory-like shelters for unaccompanied immigrant youth in the city, ranging from infants to 17 years old.

Garcia said only one shelter has reported positive cases of the coronavirus. Children who tested positive have been isolated, while employees are also being screened for COVID-19 symptoms prior to each shift. A professional cleaning company has been hired to sanitize the facilities, Garcia said.

ProPublica Illinois first reported the positive cases of the virus at the shelter Monday. ProPublica reported that two staff members have also tested positive.

According to an internal staff email reviewed by ProPublica, the first positive cases of the virus came to light Friday at Heartland’s shelter in Bronzeville. The total number of cases had risen to 19 by the end of the weekend.

As of Monday, the Office of Refugee Resettlement — the federal agency that places unaccompanied migrant children in shelters across the country — said it had identified 21 cases of COVID-19 across all of its partner facilities.

Those cases were reported “in two Texas programs, and one Illinois program,” according to the agency, making the outbreak at Heartland’s shelter the largest of its kind in the country.

The Sun-Times reported in June 2018 that Heartland Alliance was sheltering children who had been separated from their parents at the southern border. The Trump administration said last April it could take up to two years to reunite all of those families.

In a statement released Monday, the National Immigrant Justice Center, a branch of Heartland Alliance, said the Trump administration has “obstructed” the release of unaccompanied migrant children to their family members and sponsors.

“[The Office of Refugee Resettlement] must immediately release as many children as possible, and allow them to reunite with caretakers in homes where they can safely follow local governments’ shelter-in-place guidelines,” the justice center said.

Citing new health guidelines issued during the coronavirus pandemic, the Trump administration has deported more than 400 unaccompanied migrant children intercepted at the border since March 21, according to Reuters.

At least 19 children and two employees at a Chicago shelter for immigrant youth have tested positive for COVID-19 in recent days, in what appears to be the largest outbreak of the virus in the country in shelters for unaccompanied minors.

According to an email sent to staff Sunday, Heartland Human Care Services officials said the first positive test results were reported at its Bronzeville shelter on Friday and that additional cases there were confirmed over the weekend.

On Monday, officials from Heartland Alliance, the umbrella nonprofit organization that oversees the shelter program, confirmed the positive tests and said they expect there will be more cases.

“We are operating under the assumption that we will see additional positive diagnoses as we receive results from the other tests that have been administered, and the steps we are taking to ensure the health and safety of our participants and staff are based on that assumption,” Mailee Garcia, a spokeswoman for the organization, wrote in a statement. “The prognosis for all of the children in our care is very good, and we are continuing to focus on our participants’ health and well-being.”

As of last Wednesday, only six COVID-19 cases had been confirmed among children and adolescents housed in shelters around the country, according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which oversees the nation’s shelter program. All six were at shelters in New York.

ORR officials said there were also 39 “self-reports” of positive COVID-19 tests among personnel affiliated with shelter programs in six states as of Wednesday. ORR has not provided updated figures, despite repeated requests since Friday.

COVID-19 is a less serious health threat to children than it is to adults.

Heartland, according to the copies of the email obtained by ProPublica Illinois, began “trying to secure tests” for children at the Bronzeville shelter after some of them displayed “COVID-19-like symptoms,” wrote David Sinski, executive director of Heartland Human Care Services.

The email doesn’t detail symptoms, when they became evident or when children were tested. But by Friday, Heartland officials learned that one of its “participants” — as the immigrant children and youth are called — had tested positive.

On Saturday, officials were told that three additional children had tested positive. By Sunday morning, they received positive COVID-19 diagnoses for an additional 15 children, bringing the total to 19. According to the email, 10 of the 19 children are asymptomatic. Two staff members have also tested positive.

“We understand that receiving this news may leave you feeling uncertain and scared,” Sinski wrote to staff. “I want you to know that we are committed to providing you with the information that you need to know in order to keep you and your loved ones healthy and safe.”

It’s unclear how old the infected children are or where they are from. But the Bronzeville shelter, a four-story converted nursing home that can hold up to 250 boys and girls, is licensed to house children from infancy to 17 years old.

Officials said they “immediately” move children to an isolated environment when they show any signs of any illness, including COVID-19, to minimize any risk of community spread. Since Saturday, Heartland has “enhanced our social distancing measures” at the shelters to limit the contact among children and between children and staff, Garcia said.

In his email, Sinski wrote that all remaining children at the facility are being tested and that he expected those results by Tuesday. He also asked all employees who worked on the floors where children who tested positive were living to stay home with pay for two weeks. Staff members who undertake “specific activities” with children will be provided N95 masks, gowns and gloves, and are being screened for COVID-19 symptoms before each shift.

Heartland officials said they are now contracting with additional nurse practitioners to be at the shelter for every shift. They are also exploring a house parent model, which would have a subset of staff be onsite full time for the coming couple of weeks, officials said.

Heartland officials said the organization is in close contact with ORR and city public health officials.

Shelters for immigrant children, nursing homes and other congregate facilities must report to the city of Chicago when there are two or more positive COVID-19 cases, according to a March order. The city’s Health Department then provides “tailored guidance to facility staff on infection control, including cleaning protocols and how to properly manage both COVID-19 positive and exposed individuals,” a spokesperson said in a statement, adding that clusters of cases have been identified in “several facilities.”

Garcia said the organization is “doing all that we can to advocate for additional testing kits for participants and staff across our programs.” She added that “our team have been stellar and courageous champions during this pandemic, committed to both a high level of quality care and being creative and supportive to each other during this challenging time. They are true heroes.”

The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, which licenses the shelters, has been notified that children at the facility tested positive. “We’ve been in contact, and we’re offering assistance,” said agency spokesman Jassen Strokosch.

Heartland officials said a professional cleaning company has performed multiple cleanings of the facility in the past week and will continue to perform weekly deep cleanings.

According to ORR guidance meant to limit the spread of COVID-19, children who have symptoms and are recommended for testing are isolated from other children pending test results. Shelter programs are required to do twice-daily temperature checks of immigrant children and alert ORR if a child has a temperature above 100 degrees. ORR has also implemented a mandatory temperature check for anyone entering a shelter, according to officials.

ORR has also stopped placing children at shelters in California, New York and Washington, with limited exceptions, and said it is trying to find local shelters for newly arrived immigrant children to limit air travel. Previously, children were moved to shelters around the country where beds were available.

About 2,800 children are being held in the nation’s shelter system. There are 69 children at three shelters run by Heartland. The organization previously operated five shelters, all in Chicago, but has consolidated the program in response to COVID-19. “Our census was lower and consolidating sites has allowed us to implement the measures . . . to safeguard the health of our staff and participants,” a spokeswoman said.

No children have tested positive for COVID-19 at another group of shelters in Illinois run by Maryville Academy, a Catholic child welfare agency, said Sister Catherine Ryan, Maryville’s executive director. About 30 teens are currently housed at two Maryville shelters.

“I’m very grateful that all of our children are fine,” Ryan said. “Obviously, we are taking a lot of precautions to keep it that way.”

Lawyers and advocates for detained immigrant children say they’ve been worried an outbreak would occur in a shelter. Lawyers went to court in late March to ask the federal government to speed up the release of children in its custody.

“It’s been our concern all along as advocates that jails, prisons, detention facilities, even licensed shelter detention, it’s where we’re going to see the massive outbreaks and it’s going to be exponentially higher than in the broader community,” said Holly Cooper, co-director of the Immigration Law Clinic at the University of California, Davis.

Cooper said she is particularly worried about children who have preexisting conditions that have not been identified by shelter officials or ORR and will make them more vulnerable to COVID-19.

“The goal,” she said, “is to get kids out of congregate care because there’s no way it can comply with [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidance even if you’re using all the hand sanitizer in the world.”

The Pulaski County Detention Center is one of three county jails in Illinois contracted by ICE to hold suspected undocumented immigrants. The three immigrants held at Pulaski are the first ICE detainees in Illinois to test positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.

Damon Acuff, warden at the Pulaski County jail, told the Southern Illinoisan that 130 of the 145 people held at the facility are ICE detainees.

Acuff and Pulaski County Sheriff Randy Kern could not be reached for comment.

On Friday, ICE said the men who tested positive were a 26-year-old Guatemalan, a 33-year-old Honduran and a 32-year-old Mexican.

The Chicago-based National Immigrant Justice Center is working with Sidley Austin LLP to file federal lawsuits to demand the release of medically vulnerable immigrants detained in Pulaski County.

There are nearly 34,000 immigrants detained by ICE across the country. Nearly two-thirds of them have never been convicted of a crime, according to a recent analysis of detainee records by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.

ICE says 61 detainees and 19 detention center employees have tested positive for the coronavirus. Immigrant rights groups have warned about the potential rapid spread of the coronavirus in detention centers.

Lee Vanderlinden, an NIJC staff attorney, said they’re worried about their clients being at risk of contracting the virus at Pulaski County.

“The pods are set up where detainees are all living in an open area with bunk beds or in cells [and] share common areas where everyone eats. It’s impossible to keep six feet distance apart,” they said.

Lupe Perez, another NIJC attorney, said her client at the detention center is worried he’s defenseless against the virus.

Detainees “are not provided soap,” she said, “and they have to use the little money they have in commissary to buy soap, which means they can’t afford to talk to family.”

Earlier this week, the NIJC and Sidley Austin filed lawsuits on behalf of three people detained at the Jerome Combs Detention Center in Kankakee seeking their release.

Two of those immigrants, one of whom is a 46-year-old man who’s lived in Illinois for 30 years, were released Friday. The third has a hearing scheduled over the weekend.

The letter — co-written by Reps. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, D-Ill., and Donna Shalala, D-Fla., and co-sponsored by more than 60 other members of Congress — calls on the Trump administration and more than a dozen federal agencies to immediately provide all relevant materials on the pandemic in Spanish and other languages.

“As a matter of public health and safety for all, English-language proficiency should not serve as a barrier to obtain or distribute vital information from the federal government,” the letter reads. “Failing to immediately provide guidance in Spanish and other languages will jeopardize the health, safety, and economic stability of millions across this country.”

Agencies named in the letter include the White House Coronavirus Task Force, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Small Business Administration and the IRS.

A White House representative could not be reached for comment.

Census figures show more than 65 million people in the United States speak a language other than English at home. About 25 million people in the country did not speak English proficiently in 2015, according to the Migration Policy Institute.

That includes $1,000 housing grants to help with rent and mortgage payments, online enrichment programs for students, $100 million in small business loans and a disaster relief funds that “puts money into the pockets of Chicagoans who have been excluded from needed federal aid programs,”

“This order is more than just an official decree. It’s a statement of our values as a city and as Americans. We are saying, `We are all in this together’ means all of us, regardless of citizenship status. … It means that, in this crisis, we will leave no one behind. … ‘We are all in this together’ is not just a nice sentiment. It is an imperative for who we are, who we will remain as a city.”

Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th), dean of the City Council’s Socialist Caucus, said the mayor’s executive order “does not change city policy.” It simply reiterates the guarantees in Chicago’s Welcoming City Ordinance.

“The federal government has excluded undocumented workers and small business owners from federal relief efforts. If we’re going to close the gap, we need to go beyond simply reiterating the city’s existing policy and create a dedicated local fund to provide support to everyone excluded from federal relief,” Ramirez-Rosa said.

They are not criminals.

More than ever, with the coronavirus sweeping across the country, there is an urgent need for their release.

Fifty-four percent of immigrants in detention who had criminal convictions were categorized last year as Level 3 offenders, according to Syracuse University’s TRAC research center. Their “crimes” were low level offenses, such as illegal entry to the U.S. or traffic-related violations.

Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.

Those people should be set free. Their so-called crimes didn’t warrant detainment and deportation in the first place.

Another 31,000 people were being detained who had no criminal convictions at all, TRAC research showed, and some of them were asylum seekers. It’s no crime to seek refuge in the United States. Yet “detention is the default to every arriving asylum seeker,” Tania Linares Garcia, a senior litigation lawyer with the National Immigrant Justice Center based in Chicago, told me.

Those who have no convictions must also be released. Many are held in detention centers where filthy, overcrowded conditions have been well documented over the years.

Since October, 10 immigrants have died while in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, and seven children have died while in U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody or died shortly after their release.

That was before the coronavirus outbreak.

We know that packing people in tight spaces, whether at a funeral or a jail, creates a petri dish effect for coronavirus to spread.

Outbreaks of infectious diseases are common at ICE and CBP facilities. Typically, the flu is prevalent. Last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported an outbreak of mumps that infected 898 migrants and 33 detention facility staff members.

Detention facilities pose a greater danger than ever to the health of detainees and employees. By releasing people who don’t pose a threat to public safety, surrounding communities could be spared from a greater spread of the coronavirus.

As of Thursday morning, there were six confirmed cases of the coronavirus among detainees in custody and five cases among ICE employees at detention facilities, ICE reported on its website.

At ICE jails and family detention facilities, panic has set in because of the virus.

“Everyone is really desperate, and I think this is all about to collapse,” a father at the Karnes Detention Center in Texas said in a recording leaked to the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services.

Sick children were vomiting and had diarrhea, said the father, who added: “People are totally desperate because of that.”

Another father said that except for shampoo in the shower area, he wasn’t given any soap.

Linares Garcia told me that only a handful of the National Immigrant Justice Center’s clients recently have been released on humanitarian parole amid the coronavirus outbreak.

Overall, “there is no sign ICE is relenting,” Linares Garcia said. Detainees know they are sitting ducks for the virus. “The anxiety, the anguish is so strong,” she added.

ICE claims it is taking measures to prevent the spread of the virus, including distributing soap, but Linares Garcia said detainees that her organization is helping aren’t given soap unless they buy it from a detention facility’s commissary. Even then, detainees sometimes must make a choice between spending their money on soap or using it to place phone calls to their lawyers.

When you’re in a crowded place and must struggle to get your hands on a bar of soap, you’re in big trouble against a deadly virus.

When you don’t belong in jail to begin with, it’s unconscionable.

About 38,000 immigrants are in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and several thousands more are being held at facilities near the country’s borders by Customs and Border Protection.

All of those immigrants are being held on civil matters — namely, entering or residing in the United States without proper authorization — and are either waiting for their day in immigration court or have already been ordered deported.

ICE and CPB should release immigrants who are awaiting to go in front of a judge and pose no threat to public safety to prevent the disease from spreading throughout the tight confines of detention centers, Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, told reporters Tuesday.

“Thankfully, we’ve seen some judges order the release of a handful of vulnerable immigrants in custody. It also appears that ICE has been quietly releasing a few immigrants in some detention facilities, but this simply isn’t enough,” he said.

So far, there are four confirmed cases of COVID-19 among those in ICE custody along with five confirmed cases among ICE employees and personnel working in detention facilities. BuzzFeed News reports ICE is monitoring 63 detainees in 22 detention facilities.

Lawmakers suspect those numbers will rise dramatically as immigrants in detention facilities aren’t able to practice adequate social distancing.

“We’re calling on ICE to act now ... because we know that people will die if we don’t take action,” said Rep. Linda Sánchez (D-Calif.), who heads the caucus’ task force on immigration.

Detention centers are routinely criticized for not providing adequate medical care for immigrants. Ten immigrants have died while in ICE custody since October and seven children have died in CPB custody or shortly after being released, “many after receiving delayed medical care or being denied care altogether,” according to the ACLU.

“We know that detention centers do not have the sanitary conditions required to contain the potential outbreak of coronavirus inside their facilities,” said Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia (D-Ill.).

Tania Linares Garcia, a senior attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center, said one of her clients — a young man who’s lived in Chicago for most of his life and is being held at a detention center in Wisconsin — suffers from anxiety “and really isn’t doing well right now.”

“There’s no way for him to protect himself — no access to gloves, masks, anything to keep his living quarters clean. He feels like a sitting duck.”

He’s diabetic and she has rheumatoid arthritis, putting them at higher risk of getting sick and dying from the coronavirus.

But since they’re undocumented, they have to keep working — no matter what.

“If we don’t work, we can’t survive. It’s just that simple,” Sandra said.

Hector and Sandra are pushing 50 and have lived in Chicago for nearly 20 years. Both of them work at a warehouse packaging Windex, Clorox disinfecting wipes and other cleaning supplies.

“They’re really busy right now,” Sandra said.

On March 11, the day the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic over the coronavirus, a worker near Sandra on the crowded warehouse assembly line started coughing.

“That worried me,” Sandra said. The rheumatoid arthritis weakens her immune system, she said, “and I already know to stay away from people who feel sick.”

Fearing the worst, she called off work the next week, but her husband still clocked in. The couple makes about $800 a week after taxes, just enough to cover the basics, including the $1,200 monthly rent for the two-bedroom apartment they share with their 13-year-old son.

“We both have to work to make it,” Sandra said. “I’m worried about my health, but what can I do?”

(The Sun-Times agreed not to use the last names of undocumented people quoted in this story.)

One day without work becomes a crisis

There are around 400,000 undocumented immigrants in Illinois. None of them can claim unemployment insurance even if, like Hector and Sandra, they’ve paid into the system for years.

Tax-paying undocumented immigrants were also excluded from receiving $1,200 checks from the federal government in the $2 trillion stimulus package passed by Congress on Friday. Those checks are reserved for qualified workers with Social Security numbers.

Nearly half of undocumented are uninsured, according to a recent analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health care think-tank. That means there’s a high chance many of them who feel sick are still going to work, said Jorge Mujica, an immigrant and labor rights organizer with Arise Chicago.

“There’s no real safety net for undocumented immigrants, not even during a pandemic,” Mujica said. “Most undocumented immigrants don’t have paid time off or sick leave. If they’re sent home, they’re left without an income at all. One day without work for them becomes a crisis.”

Many undocumented immigrants have seen their jobs evaporate in recent weeks.

Maria, 48, worked for nine years as a housekeeper at a downtown hotel before she was fired March 18 along with 20 of her coworkers, most of whom are also undocumented.

“I asked why they were firing us instead of laying us off, but they said they couldn’t give us any more information,” she said.

Maria had health insurance through her housekeeping job, which also covered her three sons and her husband, who works construction. “We all depended on that health insurance,” she said. “Now what are we supposed to do?”

To keep calm, Maria tries to stay off Facebook and watches the news only once a day. But without a job and unsure if she’ll get help from the government, she’s having a hard time keeping her head up.

“It’s really depressing. I want to work, and now I can’t,” she said. “I wasn’t worried that much about the virus. I always took care of myself and bought disinfectant and cleaning supplies. I taught my kids how to wash their hands all the time. But not having a job makes it a lot harder not to panic.”

‘I’m their safety net right now’

As undocumented immigrants feel the pinch, their children are stepping up to keep their households afloat.

Martha Diaz is one of an estimated 35,000 young people in Illinois who have temporary legal status through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The 22-year-old works full time as a digital marketing strategist for an auto parts company in Broadview. She’s also a full-time student in her final year at Dominican University.

Diaz’s classes and her job have moved online, meaning she spends all of her time at her South Side home that she shares with her three siblings and their parents, both of whom are undocumented.

“My dad’s having trouble finding work,” she said. “My mom works with elderly clients as a home health aide but last week they told her not to go in anymore because of the coronavirus.”

“It feels like I’m their safety net right now,” Diaz said. “My parents always told us to save money, so I have some in the bank. But I don’t know if my company will start having to lay off people because there’s no income coming in. I guess we’ll see.”

It is my hope people will not take advantage of this by inviting friends and non-family-members on their boat. This is not the time to take to the waterways to party. It is important for everyone to remember, abuses of our discretion or violating the temporary regulations issued by the Fox Waterway Agency could result in the Chain O’Lakes being closed. I can’t emphasize this enough – please be responsible, use good judgement, and follow all maritime laws when enjoying our waterways.

I hate to have to emphasis this, but the second paragraph matters as much as the first.

FYI, as of noon Thursday, both the lower and upper Fox River remained closed, while the Chain O’Lakes remained at no-wake. Click here to check status changes posted by the Fox Waterway Agency.

It became even more bizarre today when many IDNR sites eopened on a limited basis.

I mean many, as in many more than originally posted as reopening.

(At the bottom, I also have an update, which I learned late today, on Hennepin-Hopper lakes at Dixon Waterfowl Refuge, one of my favorite spots in Illinois.)

As bizarre as the situation was with northeastern Illinois sites, it was nothing compared to the massive changes that went on with reopenings in southern Illinois. Click here for the latest lists of what was or is supposed to be reopened across Illinois.

The most bizarre part of today may be Heidecke Lake, the former cooling lake near Morris. It was literally decided to reopen it today, because it is part of Goose Lake Prairie. I briefly considered heading out there when I found out, but instead stuck with the reopening of Kankakee River State Park.

The other bizarre part is the state of North Point Marina. It’s listed as officially closed, but, for all practical purposes, appears to be functioning as if open. I am still trying to sort that one out officially and unofficially.

Not sure when this happened, but Silver Springs State Fish and Wildlife Area reopened on Friday, a much needed opening to ease pressure on other sites. (Rock Cut SP also unexpectedly is listed as reopened.)

Unrelated to the coronavirus, Illinois Beach SP did not reopen today because of flooding and storm damage.

Now, to Hennepin-Hopper lakes at Dixon Waterfowl Refuge near Hennepin. Paul Botts, president and executive director of The Wetlands Initiative, called and emailed late this afternoon with an update on what is happening with an experimental three-day access trial in mid-May.

In a follow-up phone call, he indicated rather certainly that he expects fishing to come back this year, but obviously that depends on lots of things.

Here is the email update:

On Tuesday, May 19 through Thursday, May 21, the Dixon Waterfowl Refuge will be open to visitors from dawn to dusk for a trial run of public access during the COVID-19 epidemic. We’re glad so many people treasure and enjoy this special place. Thank you for your understanding as we navigate this unusual and unprecedented time. Only the trails will be open on these days. The lakes will remain closed to paddling and fishing at this time. Please practice social distancing and stay at least 6 feet away from other people including TWI staff doing restoration and stewardship work. Of course the standard rules for visiting, which are posted at the Refuge, also still apply. As always, parking is allowed only in the official lots. If all parking spaces are filled, please visit the Refuge at another time. No portable toilets will be available so plan your visit accordingly. If all goes well during the three-day trial run and it’s clear that we can protect the health of both visitors and staff, we aim to keep public access moving forward into the summer. We’re hoping that everyone together can make this possible!

I sure hope it opens up. It is one of the great fishing spots in Illinois, but I love it even more just for the audacity of its concept and execution as a restoration project. If I am in the area, I climb the tower to check out the site or do some hiking.",92.5,High,Left-center,USA,1

There had been anticipation that Friday, May 1 would be the opener for boaters. On a related matter, North Point Marina also will not be reopening, because it is a concessionaire, but boat owners may gain access to their boats.

This word came today, April 30, from Chicago Harbors:

Chicago Harbors Closure: Unfortunately, all docks, boat storage facilities, parking lots, launch ramps, and other harbor properties are currently closed in accordance with current Chicago Park District closures. We will update you when we have an opening date. Boaters who ignore this order and attempt to bring their boat into the harbor during the closure could have their permit revoked.

As previously noted, some IDNR sites are being reopened on a limited basis on Friday, May 1. The reopened sites will be open from sun-up to sundown.

Here are the ones being reopened in northeastern Illinois (noticeably NOT reopening are William W. Powers State Recreation Area, Silver Springs State Fish and Wildlife Area, Braidwood Lake and Mazonia SFWA):

Northeastern Illinois: Adeline Jay Geo-Karis Illinois Beach State Park / North Point Marina, Chain O’ Lakes State Park, Illinois and Michigan Canal State Trail (includes Buffalo Rock, Channahon, Gebhard Woods, and William G Stratton), Kankakee River State Park, Moraine Hills State Park

Shabbona Lake SRA, which is listed in the northwest section, will reopen Friday, but Lakeside, as a concessionaire, is not allowed to open, so have everything before arriving.

Wisconsin’s opening day will go on Saturday, May 2, in a form never seen before.

Here are the key opening paragraphs from the Wisconsin DNR:

MADISON, Wis. – Gov. Evers’ Safer at Home order recognizes outdoor activity as essential. As such, the 2020-2021 Game Fish season will proceed as planned opening on May 2. All regulations and license requirements apply. The DNR reminds anglers to fish close to home and practice social distancing whether fishing from a boat, dock, or shoreline. It is recommended that only anglers living in the same household should fish within six feet of one another.

All state parks are reopening Friday, but there are updated hours for operation of parks. Here are the details:

Regular fishing rules and regulations apply for all DNR properties. DNR boat launches within open state parks are open. However, all state parks have updated hours of operation from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. and will be closed on Wednesdays. Anglers who want to fish within a state park on Wednesdays may still do so that day. All restrooms, water fountains, buildings, and facilities are also closed at all state parks. Northern forests, flowages, and the Lower Wisconsin Riverway system are exempt from these changes and remain open from 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., 7 days a week.

The Forest Preserve District of Will County is easing some restrictions on Friday, May 1.

Here are the key parts:

Forest Preserve District access area parking lots, boat launches to reopen May 1 The Forest Preserve District of Will County will reopen its preserve access area parking lots and boat launches on Friday, May 1, as a result of Gov. J.B. Pritzker modifying his stay-at-home order, which was instituted March 21 to fight the new coronavirus pandemic in Illinois. However, all visitor centers, dog parks, latrines and water fountains will remain closed through the duration of the stay-at-home mandate’s extension, which now ends May 30. All public programs, rentals and non-district events have been canceled through May 30. Because the Monee Reservoir visitor center/concessions building is closed, there will be no boat rentals until further notice. These closures and cancellations will remain in effect to help stop the spread of the new coronavirus, which could overwhelm healthcare institutions and cause more deaths. Once parking lots reopen May 1, people should not be congregating in the preserves and at trailheads, which could spread COVID-19. It may be necessary to temporarily close sites where social distancing is not being maintained.

J.B. Pritzker talking Thursday about the “phased reopening of some of our state parks,” I immediately thought I would be at Mazonia State Fish and Wildlife Area at dawn on May 1, both to fish and to forage for morel mushrooms.

Not so fast, Mazonia was not on the reopening list. The cooling lakes in northeast Illinois were not either.

So now, my plan is hit Kankakee River State Park the morning of Friday, May 1. I am certain I will not be alone in wanting to hit the 10 or so miles of shoreline there along the Kankakee River.

Readers had a bunch of questions related to the limited reopening of Illinois Department of Natural Resources sites and also about whether the easing of some restrictions would mean anything for the forest preserves restrictions.

Below is what I’ve gathered so far on turkey hunting, trout season, access and reasoning for site openings or still being closed, and an update from the Forest Preserve District of Will County.

Click here for the latest from the IDNR on the evolving opening of some sites. While reading the list of activities mentioned, I did not see turkey hunting listed. Early May has the final days of turkey hunting for those holding permits for specific sites.

So I contacted IDNR deputy director Rachel Torbert, who emailed back Friday:

To ensure the safety of all visitors, hunting remains suspended at state parks, fish and wildlife areas and recreational areas. Understanding closure and fee concerns raised by permit holders, IDNR is reviewing all possible solutions, including refunds for all spring 2020 turkey permits issued by the Department. Additional information will be provided via the IDNR website as soon as it is available.

This is where things get intertwined, with no turkey hunting at the IDNR sites that reopen, no longer do morel foragers or birdwatchers need to wait until 1 p.m. to begin wandering the woods and fields. They can begin doing so at dawn on May 1 at those sites reopening.

* * *

While reaching out to Torbert, I also asked for the reasoning on not opening the cooling lakes and she replied:

Protecting the health and safety of our site visitors, staff and first responders is our highest priority. With that in mind, IDNR worked with Governor Pritzker and the Illinois Department of Public Health to develop a list of state parks, fish and wildlife areas, recreational areas and historic sites which considered many factors. Selected sites represent parks, fish and wildlife areas and recreational areas which are distributed throughout the state and are accessible to many, offer a wide variety of recreational opportunities with acreage to allow for social distancing directives, provide necessary restroom and handwashing facilities, and have on-site staff to ensure the safety of visitors and maintenance of the site and site facilities. Safety of park visitors and potential strain on staff, first responders and law enforcement also were considered when reviewing potential sites. IDNR will continue to work closely with the Governor’s Office and the Illinois Department of Public Health as directives change to further assess site closures.

Technically, I understand, but I wish they would reconsider on the cooling lakes.

I understand keeping the high-volume, high-density, sites, such as Starved Rock SP and William W. Powers State Recreational Area and Illinois Beach SP closed, but some of the lesser sites not being reopened have me scratching my head.

* * *

As to trout season at the Forest Preserves of Cook County sites, director of communications Carl Vogel emailed Friday, “We do not currently have plans for a date for the start of trout season.’’

The opening of trout season in the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County is on hold, pending further review, as communications lead Deb Humiston emailed Friday:

I found out that we’re waiting to review the official signed executive order from the governor’s office when it’s available. We’ll then adjust our operations as needed to align with the revise/extended order. We’ll communicate any adjustments — which will start on May 1 — next week.

Stay tuned on the trout season there and a couple other nearby sites.

Here’s the key paragraphs on the easing of some restrictions at the Forest Preserve District of Will County:

She made a difference.,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ol7wd2XYHEHqkvqS1EoQX7QZDFM=/0x103:1500x888/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19938985/MBrown.png,"Share All sharing options for: Michelle Abernathy wasn’t just another COVID-19 victim. She made a difference.

Torrence Jones remembers the day his girlfriend Michelle Abernathy learned a developmentally disabled resident of Ludeman Developmental Center, where they worked, had become the first person there to test positive for COVID-19.

It was March 28, a Saturday. Abernathy had stopped by the Park Forest campus to catch up on work. She was informed the stricken man lived in a housing unit under her supervision.

Abernathy, 52, made sure the resident was receiving proper care and that her staff had personal protective equipment, Jones said.

By the next night, Abernathy had a fever. Fifteen days later, she was dead, a victim of the coronavirus.

The Illinois Department of Human Services revealed this past week that the death toll at Ludeman has reached six — three staff members and three residents.

The latest to die: Jose Velez and Cephus Lee. They worked in Ludeman’s dietary department, delivering meals from a central kitchen to the 38 residential homes that comprise the facility.

Ludeman has been hit harder than the other 13 state-operated residential and hospital sites that care for people with developmental disabilities and mental health needs. As of Thursday, 155 of its 344 residents had tested positive, with 91 awaiting results. The rest tested negative.

Officials say most of those residents haven’t had any symptoms, and there’s hope the worst has passed.

It’s a brighter picture than what’s happening in nursing homes around the state, where the death toll is much higher for similarly situated residents — though advocates say the state isn’t reporting COVID data on thousands of disabled individuals in private, nonprofit residential facilities that are state-licensed.

Sixty-eight of 892 Ludeman employees have tested positive, but union officials say testing has been limited. They’re pressing to get tests offered onsite for all workers. The state is working to do that, a spokesperson said.

While my heart goes out to everyone at Ludeman affected by the outbreak, I’m concentrating on the staff in part because it’s difficult to imagine the terror that would come from seeing three coworkers drop dead in two weeks.

“There’s no question they’re concerned,” said Anne Irving, who works with Ludeman’s staff as regional director of AFSCME Council 31.

Irving said that concern is directed as much as anything toward the residents, with whom they’ve developed deep relationships.

Caring for developmentally disabled people is demanding in the best of times, heroic in a pandemic. These are jobs that do not allow for social distancing.

Most Ludeman residents have serious medical conditions or severe behavioral problems in addition to developmental disabilities. More than half are nonverbal.

That means hands-on work for the staff that can include feeding and bathing residents and helping them get dressed in addition to keeping them engaged and entertained to help pass time under quarantine.

Many residents don’t understand the need to be isolated in their rooms because of the highly infectious disease, said Sarah Ross, whose younger sister Kathy has lived at Ludeman for 34 of the past 37 years.

“They are the angels and heroes of this community,” Ross said of Ludeman’s staff.

Abernathy had started her job last fall after 20 years as an investigator for the state Department of Children and Family Services, looking out for abused and neglected children.

“I could see the love she had for these individuals,” said Jones, who started dating Abernathy after training her for the position.

With a bachelor’s degree from Chicago State and master’s from Sparta College, Abernathy was very involved with her sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, but always made time to watch the Bears — and Dallas Cowboys — play, Jones said.

They lived together in Chatham and planned to get engaged.

I wish I could tell you more about Velez and Lee, but I don’t know much. Velez worked for the agency for 30 years. Lee, 59, formerly of Markham, was there less than two years.

Ross said Ludeman has a continuing need for masks, gloves and gowns because the staff goes through so much each day. She asked me to plead for donations.

“At times, it seems we are a forgotten community,” she said.
