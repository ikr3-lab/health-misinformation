The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) first received a clinical sample of the unknown virus that later became known as SARS-CoV-2 on 30 December 2020, Wang Yanyi, an immunologist and director of the institute, told CGTN broadcaster on 23 May, denouncing the Trump administration's claims that the novel coronavirus escaped from the Wuhan bio lab as “pure fabrication”.

US Has Been Opposing Int'l Biosafety Verification Mechanism for Decades

The Trump administration has repeatedly urged Beijing to grant access to Wuhan virology labs to American and other foreign inspectors. However, the People's Republic rubbished Washington's claims about the virus' origins and expressed doubts that the so-called ""independent"" investigation pushed for by the US would be unbiased and objective. Washington's verbal attacks against China and the alleged non-transparency of its bio research have turned the spotlight on the US' own bioweapons programme.

On 13 May, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov raised the issue of US biological laboratories established overseas, most notably in the countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), and in former Soviet republics.

""There is a fairly dense network of these laboratories along the perimeter of the Russian Federation and near Chinese borders"", Lavrov told journalists, revealing that Moscow had signed a memorandum of understanding on biosecurity with Tajikistan and is holding similar talks with Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Armenia, and other neighbours in the post-Soviet space.

Since 2001, Russia, China, and many other countries have advocated for the creation of a verification mechanism within the framework of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction to ensure biosafety and transparency with regard to biological research across the world. Still, the US remains ""just about the only country"" which has categorically opposed this proposal for roughly 20 years, according to the Russian foreign minister.

""This is another indication of American exceptionalism"", says Petri Krohn, Finnish political analyst and cybersecurity specialist. ""It can safely be assumed that the United States biological defence programme is 'developing pathogenic agents'. This is allowed under the Biological Weapons Convention as long as it is for defensive and not offensive purposes. Similar 'gain-of-function' (GOF) research has been done quite openly and transparently by civilian scientists"".

The analyst alleges that ""there is no bioweapons research programme in any other country with the scope of the US programme"".

In mid-April, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova did not rule out that the Americans were using such bio labs in third countries ""to develop and modify various pathogenic agents, including for military purposes"". Earlier, the issue was discussed by Secretary of Russia’s Security Council Nikolai Patrushev in his November 2019 op-ed for Rossiyskaya Gazeta: the Russian security chief signalled concerns about the Pentagon's network of overseas biological labs ""which conduct research on infectious diseases and where biological weapons can be made"".

US Domestic & Overseas Bio Experiments Raise New Questions

The Chinese are concerned about the US' domestic and overseas bio experiments, which remain no less shrouded in secrecy and non-transparent for the international community than their Russian counterparts.

In early May, the People's Liberation Army's English-language website published ""Ten questions the US needs to offer clear answers to the world"". One of these questions touches upon the US' avian influenza virus modification experiment, which was described by Science Magazine, the academic journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), in February 2019.

The journal reported that in 2018, a US government review panel ""quietly approved"" experiments with the avian H5N1 influenza virus that were previously ""considered so dangerous that federal officials had imposed an unusual top-down moratorium on such research"" since they could potentially enable the pathogen to jump to humans.

Yet another question listed in the PLA list is about bio research conducted at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), located in Fort Detrick, Maryland, before and after April 2020. According to The New York Times' August 2019 report, ""safety concerns at a prominent military germ lab have led the government to shut down research involving dangerous microbes like the Ebola virus"". On 1 April 2020, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) restored the full operating capability of the USAMRIID, but the details of the shutdown remained unclear. ""What is the truth behind?"" the PLA website asks.

Similarly, the Chinese website questions the scope and purpose of US bio research overseas: ""Why does the US keep tight-lipped about it?"" it asks.

""I think these questions are legitimate to ask"", says Rob Kajiwara, a Hawaiian human rights activist. ""I'm not saying that I think COVID-19 is a weapon, but we are well aware that the US has a long history of biological and chemical warfare"".

At a press conference on 8 May, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying pointed out that while China has only two P4 (biosafety level 4) laboratories dealing with dangerous viruses, the US has 13 bio labs of that kind which are ""either in operation, under expansion or in planning"". She noted that in addition, the US has 1,495 medium containment facilities (P3), ""not including many other labs it built in territories of the former Soviet Union, like in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, and in many other places around the world"".

Will US be Able to Contain Hazardous Leak if It Fails to Curb COVID?

According to Petri Krohn, the USAMRIID ""is likely to have the largest collection of naturally occurring viruses and their genomes"". He presumed that ""one of the main functions of the satellite laboratories in the former Soviet Union and around the world is to collect these viruses"".

As for the US avian flu experiments, the Finnish analyst highlights that gain-of-function (GOF) studies are believed to be highly controversial. ""The US imposed a four-year moratorium on funding for GOF work, but new research, like the H5N1 influenza study have now resumed. It is impossible to know if similar studies are done in the biological defence programme"", he says.

What's more troubling is that given the US failure to contain COVID-19 ""because of the diverse cultures, the individualist ideology and the huge economic inequality"", the question arises as to whether the US would be able to effectively tackle a potential virus spread if it escaped either from its domestic or overseas labs, the analyst notes.

Chinese daily newspaper Global Times suggested that by building bio labs overseas, the US is seeking to avoid a potential leak accident, as well as legal problems and pressure from US media and anti-war groups. Citing Chinese military experts, the media outlet put forward an assumption that Beijing and Moscow could initiate an investigation of American bio labs worldwide at the UN to pressure the US into giving long-overdue answers to the questions about its secretive research.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended his senior adviser Dominic Cummings, who reportedly ignored COVID-19 lockdown rules while travelling with his wife who had coronavirus symptoms.

""I think that what they did was totally understandable. I think any father, any parent would frankly understand what he did and I certainly do"", Johnson said at a news conference on Sunday.

The UK prime minister also stated that he had held ""extensive"" conversations with Cummings and concluded that he acted ""responsibly, legally and with integrity"".

According to the Daily Mirror, Cummings has been reported to the Durham Police for breaking the COVID-19 lockdown rules.

Cummings stated earlier that he had travelled to Durham to be near extended family because his wife was showing COVID-19 symptoms. He reportedly thought that he was also infected and wanted to ensure that his four-year-old son was looked after.

According to The Guardian, Cummings was spotted in Durham on 19 April, and at Barnard Castle, which is located 30 miles from Durham, on Easter Day. The Guardian reported on 23 May that UK ministers had insisted that Cummings stayed put once arriving at the property in Durham, where he was seeking support from his extended family as he had demonstrated coronavirus symptoms, along with his wife.

In response to the British media reports, a Downing Street spokeswoman said that the stories, particularly from the Mirror and The Guardian, were inaccurate.

""We will not waste our time answering a stream of false allegations about Mr Cummings from campaigning newspapers"", the spokeswoman said in a statement on Saturday.

Following the reports about Cummings, calls for his resignation have gained momentum. Cummings was at the helm of the Vote Leave campaign and took part in the development of the British government’s coronavirus strategy.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

Thousands in Southend, Brighton, Cornwall and London are immune from COVID-19. Well, how else do you explain the crowds sunbathing and playing in the sea forgetting all about social distancing this week? It’s great news that it appears we are beginning to turn the corner on Coronavirus but there is clearly still a long way to go.

We, the British public, have played a massive part in this happening by staying at home for weeks. It’s been a real team effort and we have all done our duty but now it is clear that some have decided to play by different rules and they are threatening the safety of us all.

Fighting COVID on the Beaches?

The Furlough scheme was not designed for people to have in effect an extended holiday whilst other essential workers are risking their lives. If you are furloughed or can’t work in your normal place you are meant to stay at home apart from exercising and getting the shopping in. That’s too difficult, is it?

Likewise, the easing of the lockdown was meant to be all about getting more people back to work, not a green light for everyone to do a Cliff Richard and go on a summer holiday.

I have been extremely critical of the government’s lack of clarity on their messaging but it is not Boris Johnson’s fault that selfish fools have decided to decamp to the seaside.

Every person who has been on the beaches of Brighton or Bournemouth is a disgrace and a selfish bastard.

They also supplied a real slap in the face of those workers who are still getting to work and doing their jobs. As the Sex Pistols sang they are “having a cheap holiday in other people’s misery”.

Not only that but they are dicing not only with their own death but with the lives of millions of Brits. Whilst they frolic in the sea they are just increasing the chances of a second wave that could well turn into a tsunami of deaths.

Tourist boards and the cops shouldn’t be having to try and force these selfish morons to sunbathe in their own gardens or their nearest park; these people should realise they have to be team players and work for the common good.

I fully understand why people are getting restless after two months of misery but breaking the lockdown in this manner is just not acceptable. There are no excuses.

There has been much war talk and imagery during the pandemic but at the moment we are clearly not fighting Coronavirus on the beaches, we are actually collaborating with it.

Consult the Experts

Instead of coming up with more gimmicks like an app, immunity certificates, or quarantine for people arriving in the UK we need Boris to lead from the front and get back to a basic message which is, we all need to play our part and work for the common good.

He also needs to treat us like adults and tell us the facts and be straight with us and admit that this NHS app doesn’t and isn’t going to work. Boris needs to man up and tell us this and admit his mistakes instead of hiding behind it like a pound shop Wizard of Oz.

Immunity certificates won’t be worth the paper they’re written on and how the hell are our police expected to enforce it or check on it?

The same goes for this ridiculous idea of a 14-day quarantine period for anyone entering the UK. This is unworkable and at least two months too late and will kill the airline and holiday industry.

Instead of coming up with madcap ideas that can’t be policed and are in effect just a PR con or exercise, Boris should be calling in the Like of Ryanair Boss, Michael O’Leary and Stelios and getting their input and ideas. Likewise, Tim Martin of Wetherspoons should be on some kind of committee to get our pubs and clubs reopened. He has the expertise and experience, so let’s use that to move us forward.

Do Your Duty

However, we all need to do our bit too and it is not just those on the beaches who need to take a long hard look at themselves in the mirror.

What about the fools who have decided that the lack of traffic on the roads is a reason for them to drive like madmen around the streets. Warwick has been turned into the Monaco of the Midlands with selfish tools racing around the one-way system. Posing a real danger to themselves and others.

Talking of driving have the people who have joined the mile-long queues to get a MacDonald’s not learned anything from this pandemic about the connection between obesity and possible death from COVID-19?

Why would you wait to pick up a sugar-laden snack or a Starbucks? Is your life really that shallow and devoid of meaning that you would wait for hours to pick up this crap? Watching this cavalcade of junk, I’m reminded of the lyrics of ‘Psycle Sluts’ by the poet John Cooper Clarke, “For you, that's how the world could end. Not with a bang but a Wimpy” (or nowadays a McDonalds!)

There has been much talk in the newspapers of how the lockdown and pandemic will change people’s attitudes to life and that perhaps we will be less selfish and less obsessed with consumerism but judging by the early reactions to the easing of lockdown I don’t hold out much hope for that.

Unlike Mrs Thatcher, I do believe there is such a thing as society. When Boris talked with such optimism during the recent election campaign it galvanised people and gave him a massive majority. This enabled him, amongst other things, to deliver Brexit but we need some of that collective will and optimism again now to defeat a much bigger enemy than the undemocratic EU.

We must all do our duty.

So, let’s get this straight. At a time when the US is leading the world with deaths and infections from the disease, the Pentagon views flexing muscles with warplanes in the Asia Pacific is somehow a demonstration of American potency.

While the American public is crying out for more resources to cope with the pandemic, Washington sees fit to ramp up militarism not just in the Asia Pacific, but also in the Arctic region, the Persian Gulf and the Caribbean.

US warships despatched to the Caribbean are said to be on a mission to counter-narcotic trafficking. Few people will buy that pretext. The military force is deployed as a threat to Venezuela and its socialist government which the Trump administration has openly targeted for regime change.

A failed coup attempt earlier this month involving a private US mercenary outfit may or may not have had official support from the White House.

But one thing is clear: when Russia proposed a statement of support for Venezuela at the UN Security Council this week in which the failed coup was denounced as a violation of the UN charter forbidding aggression, the draft statement was “killed” by Washington’s envoy.

The implication is that Washington’s public position sees nothing wrong with aggression despite the flagrant violation of international law that it involves.

In that case, it could be expected that the US will attempt to block Iranian oil tankers en route to Venezuela. If aggression is acceptable to Washington then why not also a bit of high-seas piracy?

Five Iranian-flagged tankers are due to dock in the South American country in the coming days. They are reportedly ferrying $45 million worth of gasoline to alleviate Venezuela’s crippled economy as it struggles like many other nations to control the coronavirus pandemic.

Venezuela is a major exporter of crude oil but due to US sanctions its capacity to refine fuel has been decimated. This has caused severe shortages for Venezuelan transport which has, in turn, exacerbated the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Both Venezuela and Iran have warned the US to not interfere in the sea passage of the oil tankers. Both countries have been burdened with American sanctions, but they are legally entitled to conduct bilateral trade. If US warships impede the transport, then it will be viewed by Venezuela and Iran as an act of piracy. We might add that the rest of the world will view it that way too. An act of piracy compounding acts of economic aggression under heartless US sanctions.

Given the pandemic crisis, Iran’s supply of vital fuel to Venezuela is not merely a normal trade transaction, but a courageous act of solidarity and humanitarian aid.

The Trump administration has mischievously indicated it will do something to stop the Iranian ships reaching Venezuela. What that something is open to guesswork. Will it use its warships in the Caribbean to mount a blockade?

Iran has warned it will retaliate. Perhaps by attacking American warships in the Persian Gulf, where skirmishing has already taken place.

Venezuela says it is sending naval forces to escort the Iranian tankers once they arrive in its territorial waters.

In the next coming days, a showdown awaits which could have explosive repercussions, not least because the Iranian tankers are reckoned to contain 1.5 million barrels of gasoline.

The US head of Southern Command, Admiral Craig Faller, this week played down the probability of an armed confrontation with the Iranian vessels.

He is quoted as saying: “You have to ask yourself what interest Iran has in Venezuela, where we have seen recent indications of Iranian military and state support?”

Eh, let’s guess Admiral Faller, maybe simply an act of solidarity by two nations who are under the boot of American imperialism and illegal sanctions that amount to a crime against humanity.

American global power right now is seen as a farce. It has been devastated by a virus and shown to be a lying cheat over its attempt to smear China and the World Health Organization. Its sanctioning against nations struggling with a deadly disease is barbaric terrorism; and while millions of Americans are facing poverty, the US is sending warships and warplanes to all corners of the world.

Washington won’t dare do piracy in the Caribbean at this juncture. Because it can’t afford another fiasco. Its global image is already in tatters.

But it isn’t. In large parts of the world there are even worse public health hazards, only they don’t get anywhere near the same coverage.

Think things are bad in the UK? Well, at least we don’t have a plague of locusts to worry about.

In 2020, East African countries have suffered the worst locusts invasions for 70 years, and a second, even more destructive wave threatens countries from west Africa to the Middle East, and India.

The World Bank has warned that regional locust swarms (one seen in Kenya was the size of Luxembourg), could swell numbers 400-fold by June, causing costs and damages to food production of up to $8.5bn by the end of the year. All in a region where already around 20m people are severely food insecure.

‘This is a scourge of Biblical proportions- yet as ancient as this scourge is- its scale today is unprecedented in recent times’ UN officials have said.

If giant locusts swarms were bad enough, there’s also the dreaded mosquito. There were 405,000 deaths from malaria in 2018, 94% of them in sub-Saharan Africa. That’s still over 80,000 more deaths than we’ve had so far globally with Covid-19- which at time of writing Africa has seen less than 3,000 deaths from.

What’s more, the World Health Organisation has warned that severe disruptions to insecticide-treated net campaigns and in access to anti-malarial medicines, could lead to a doubling of malaria deaths in sub-Saharan Africa this year compared to 2018.

Yet despite the large number of lives it claims media coverage of malaria is scant.

It’s a similar story with HIV/AIDS. Yes, we all heard a lot about AIDS in the 1980s and 90s, but since then? By 2007 over 20 million Africans- yes 20 MILLION- had died of the disease. Around 770,000 people died of AIDS-related illnesses in 2019- with just over 40% of them in eastern and southern Africa.

That’s down from a peak of 1.7m in 2004, but it’s still a large enough number.

Part of the problem with the saturation coverage of Covid-19 is that it makes us forget that there are other diseases and public health problems which pose even greater threats to mankind. The daily press conferences in the UK, in which the numbers of those who died with Covid-19 is announced, has caused considerable anxiety in the public, but suppose this was done for all deaths? For instance, cancer claims the lives of around 165,000 Britons a year, that’s around 450 people a day. Why isn’t this mentioned at the press conferences so viewers can make the comparison?

One also remembers the video of the policewoman in South Yorkshire berating a man and his children for being in their front garden a few weeks back telling him that ‘a thousand people died yesterday’. But on average you’d expect around 1,600- 1,700 deaths a day in the UK- based on a total of 616,000 deaths in 2018.

If you don’t have such context, then the daily Covid-19 death tallies, which are in fact an aggregate of deaths, including some which occurred several weeks earlier, seem much more alarming. No one is saying that Covid-19 isn’t serious it clearly is- only that a sense of perspective is needed. One can get that perspective by focusing on Africa. It’s been said that no one who visits Africa comes back unchanged and that was certainly the case with me when I went to Zimbabwe in 2014. While we were staying at Victoria Falls, my wife came became ill very suddenly with what we thought was a bad case of malaria, but fortunately was ‘just’ food poisoning. But visiting Zimbabwe made me more aware of the health hazards people there have faced.

The country was devastated by the HIV-AIDS pandemic- by the mid-2000s, life expectancy had fallen to 37 for men and 34 for women- the lowest in the world. In 2008 there was also a bad cholera epidemic, claiming over 4,000 lives, recently there has been an increase in malaria cases too, with a cumulative total of 170,303 up to the third week of April, and 152 deaths.

In the west, and ‘global north’, compared to sub-Saharan Africa, we’ve been very lucky.

Our Covid-19 worries should make us more empathic to people in other parts of the world and understand that living with dangerous infections, viruses which kill many hundreds of thousands of people and the threat of destructive natural pests, is the norm for many.

China’s biggest political gathering of the year is finally taking place after a two-month delay because of the coronavirus pandemic. Called “Two Sessions,” the first meeting was yesterday and was a gathering of top political leaders of the Chinese Communist Party. Today’s meeting is of the National People’s Congress. Premier Li Keqiang will lay out the country’s economic goals and the policies needed to achieve them. And the U.S. government is lashing out at a new proposed Hong Kong security law.

Unemployment in the United States is likely in the 25 percent range with some 40 million Americans having filed for unemployment benefits in the past month. In real terms, it’s almost certainly higher, perhaps significantly, as many people have dropped out of the labor market or their benefits have run out. Like the US, the UK has struggled with its response to the coronavirus. But the official UK unemployment rate is less than four percent. That’s ridiculous, of course. Unofficial figures put it at around 20 percent. As Mark Twain once said, there are three kinds of lies: Lies, damn lies, and statistics. Is that what we’re seeing in the UK? John speaks with Neil Clark, a journalist and broadcaster whose work has appeared in The Guardian, The Week, and Morning Star.

On this episode of The Critical Hour, Dr. Wilmer Leon is joined by Caleb Maupin, journalist and political analyst who focuses his coverage on US foreign policy.

It's Friday: that means it's panel time!

""The US State Department has approved a possible sale to Taiwan of 18 MK-48 Mod6 advanced technology heavyweight torpedoes and related equipment for an estimated cost of $180 million, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement on Wednesday,"" Reuters reported Wednesday. What will happen next as tensions rise with China?

Venezuela and Iran, two countries that the US has decided to make adversaries, and which have been ""stung by sanctions and hobbled by the coronavirus, are forging a closer strategic partnership, providing embattled President Nicolás Maduro a vital lifeline and offering Tehran the prospect of a new center of influence just across the Caribbean Sea from Florida,"" the Washington Post reported Friday. ""The most public display of the deepening relationship: five oil tankers now steaming across the Atlantic Ocean to Venezuela, carrying what analysts estimate to be 60 million gallons of Iranian gasoline ... The first of the ships is set to arrive in Venezuelan waters as soon as this weekend, to relieve fuel shortages so dire that the sick can’t get to hospitals and produce is rotting on farms."" How will the US react to this as the ships get closer to Venezuela?

US President Donald Trump continues to attack China for what he describes as ""worldwide killing"" from COVID-19. This message is likely to be relevant in the 2020 US presidential campaign. ""The White House salvos have sought to keep a focus on China's early response to the virus and what Trump has called a 'China-centric' deference at the World Health Organization. China, in turn, has portrayed itself as a good global citizen willing to work with the United Nations and other countries to defeat the pandemic,"" the Washington Post reported Thursday.

In David Lindorff's recent piece for RT, titled ""COVID-19 is massacring US elderly in nursing homes, neglected for years by a power-hungry industry,"" he states, ""The elderly in US care institutions are dying disproportionately from COVID-19. The pandemic has revealed the extent to which their wellbeing and safety have been sacrificed by an industry that prioritizes profit and influence.” How is this happening?

""America’s billionaires have seen their wealth increase by 12.5 percent during the COVID-19 lockdown period. The Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), a Washington, DC-based think tank, released a study Thursday showing that, in the eight weeks between March 18 and May 14, the country’s super-wealthy have added a further $368.8 billion to their already enormous fortunes,"" Alan MacLeod wrote in a May 15 MintPress News article. All this comes at the same time that the economy has undeniably imploded for working people. MacLeod's article continues: ""A record 36 million Americans have filed for unemployment insurance, with millions more losing their employer-based health care plans, and around a third of the country not paying its rent. Schools, factories, offices, and other businesses remain shuttered. The Trump administration has promised to provide $1,200 to every citizen, but it will be months before everyone receives their check. As a result, there has been an explosion in the use of food banks, as desperate citizens line up for hours in the hopes of receiving a box of food.""

""The US has rejected wording in a World Health Organization resolution that backs the right of poor countries to ignore patents in order to gain access to a COVID-19 vaccine or treatment,"" the Financial Times reported this week. ""Washington dissociated itself Tuesday from elements of a motion passed by WHO members, saying that it sent 'the wrong message to innovators who will be essential to the solutions the whole world needs.' Many governments, particularly in Africa, fear they will be squeezed out by richer countries unless they can force companies that discover anti-COVID-19 therapies to share their intellectual property with manufacturers able to produce them cheaply at scale.""

It appears that Dr. Deborah Birx has taken Trump's side, chastising the US agency for what she claims are inflated COVID death numbers. US observers explain the conflict between Trump and the medical experts and shed light on Birx's ""political game"".

As calls for reopening the US economy become louder inside the Trump camp, tensions between the White House and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have soared. CDC director Robert R. Redfield and counterpart Anthony Fauci, the head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) have repeatedly warned the president's Coronavirus Task Force against reopening the country too soon. According to some reports, it is Dr. Deborah Birx, however, who has Trump's ear.

Birx: Mediator or New Political Player in WH?

Birx was recently dubbed by Axios ""the real power doctor"" on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, emphasising the physicians' ""masterful political skills"". According to Axios, ""Birx strategically emphasises the points Trump wants to hear"". She, in particular, is highly critical of the World Heath Organization (WHO) and insists that the global entity is badly in need of reform. Birx has claimed that WHO's tracking system is inflating mortality rates and case numbers by up to 25 percent. She has also asserted that ""there is nothing from the CDC that [she] can trust"", according to The Washington Post. On Thursday, Birx touted recent reports claiming sharp declines in both deaths and hospitalisations across the country, claims that could accelerate the reopening of the US economy.

""Dr. Birx role has been highly questionable in the early stages, but she appears to have become more responsible of late"", observes James Fetzer, professor emeritus at University of Minnesota.

He emphasises the doctor's criticism of CDC tabulation of COVID-related deaths which she claims distort and inflate COVID-19 statistics. According to Fetzer, Birx has declared that ""The White House has been completely justified in discounting the 'experts' from NIH, the WHO and the CDC"".

Birx previously decried what she described as media exaggeration and fear-mongering over the deadly virus, noted Pamela Geller, an American political activist, blogger and editor-in-chief of the Geller Report, in the the top health official's critiques of the CDC.

""The level of misinformation and disinformation is deeply troubling"", she suggests. ""The continuing shutdown of our country is the biggest mistake in American history, and the White House is correct in repeatedly calling for reopening"".

Birx is Trying to Balance Between Science & Calls to Reopen

American journalist and author Daniel Lazare is not impressed by Birx's performance: ""Deborah Birx may think she's the 'Trump whisperer' who can keep him under control"", he says. ""But she's only able to do so is by telling him what he wants to hear"".

The journalist is skeptical about Birx's attempts to ""defend"" Trump in the press. According to Lazare, she sometimes distorts reality in an apparent attempt to appease the president. ""On 28 March, she declared in a press conference that 'almost 40 percent of the country' has 'extraordinarily low numbers' of COVID cases, neglecting to mention that those are rural areas containing only 7.2 percent of the US population"", he notes.

Birx is not much of a political player, she is just ""trying to balance between the Trump administration's desire to rapidly reopen and basic scientific facts"" opines Caleb Maupin, speaker, writer, journalist, and political analyst.

""She is trying to play a centrist position, as is Fauci"", he says. ""Birx and Fauci trying to navigate in the middle of this, and they're facing kind of an onslaught from Trump's supporters in the Trump administration"".

Science is Held Hostage to Political & Economic Interests

The CDC has seemingly taken a backseat in the White House task force and is playing a much quieter role than at initial stages of the pandemic, as media remark on Fauci's absence from interviews this week – as the country reopens – as similarly noteworthy. The CDC release of detailed guidance for reopening schools, mass transit and nonessential businesses was made without a formal announcement, and came only after a number of states started lifting lockdowns, according to CNBC.

According to Maupin, the CDC, as well as other health agencies, have fallen victim to mounting pressure in some parts of the US.

""It would be seen as undermining the medical community at a time when they need support"", the journalist says. ""It's an indirect form of pressure, but it shows that science is deeply impacted by society. There's a whole history of this. Science is not independent"".

The political analyst suggests that ""science is always impacted by the society that creates it"" and ""political interests that fund research would prefer one outcome as opposed to another"". The issue of dropping the lockdown measures has also become a playground for various business interests, with some industries, like Walmart and Amazon, benefitting from the lockdown, while the real sector is desperately pushing to reopen.

""We have one section of the American elite that wants the science to say we can reopen now and the American elite that wants to say science says we have to be closed down as long as we possibly can"", Maupin says, additionally claiming that the so-called elite is ""paying scientists to say what they want"".

The dysfunctional dynamics at play between the CDC and White House are clear for all to see, echoes Ethan Ralph, founder of conservative website, The Ralph Retort.

""I think it's fairly obvious that there's been tension for awhile now"", he says. ""I don't think Trump really wanted to shut things down in the first place and was basically scared into it. Ever since then, he's been moving to open up as quickly as possible. Some see this as reckless, even within his own virus response high command"".

'Political & Health Officials Should Work in Unison'

Though the CDC has its problems, it must be remembered that the agency is dealing with Trump, who is determined to reopen the economy regardless of the cost to public health, and whatever the agencies say or do is going to be wrong, argues Daniel Lazare. According to him, ""the tension between the White House and the CDC is just the latest manifestation of the chaos that has reigned since the virus first appeared in the US in late January"".

The controversy between the White House and the country's health and science community is only exacerbating the problem, according to Professor Kelley Lee, tier 1 Canadian research chair in Global Health Governance.

""The countries that respond most effectively during this pandemic will be countries where public health officials and political leaders work in close unison, and where public health experts are allowed to define policy action"", Lee said.

What's going on in the US is the opposite, Lee remarked. According to him, the Trump administration ""has frequently ignored the advice of scientific experts and prioritised political and economic interests instead"".

While CDC has been subject to harsh criticism by the Trump administration and its conservative supporters, the truth of the matter is that SARS-CoV-2 is an absolutely new virus no one has ever dealt with, underscores Mitchell Feierstein, a hedge-fund manager and CEO of the Glacier Environmental Fund Limited.

""As far as the CDC - everyone has a view on COVID-19, which in reality, is a virus that no one yet fully understands - we have incomplete data sets and no safe vaccine"", Feierstein highlights. ""What we do know is that it's certainly not like the flu"".

Strommer.

On 15 May, an out-of-state seafood worker tested positive for Covid-19 in Dillingham, six weeks after Bristol Bay regional entities requested the State of Alaska that it shut down the commercial fishery in the region. The feared at that time was that the state would fail to ensure pre-arrival testing and enforced quarantine for incoming fishery participants. According to Alaska Public Media, it’s the ninth case of a non-resident testing positive for coronavirus in Alaska. The state's governor, Mike Dunleavy, is resisting closure of the highly lucrative Bristol Bay fishery, vowing to maintain anti-COVID protection measures. However, tribal leaders have grave doubts about how the state authorities can enforce these measures and require seasonal workers to observe quarantine.

Why COVID-19 Poses Severe Challenge to Bristol Bay

""The main threat is due to the influx of thousands of fishermen who can potentially infect the vulnerable population with COVID-19"", says Ambassador Ronald Barnes of the Indigenous Peoples and Nations Coalition (IPNC), Alaska. ""The fish processors and their crew are entering the Bristol Bay region with Essential Employee exemptions stated in their application to enter Alaska by the state of Alaska. The exemption references to social distancing, quarantines, curfews and other restrictions. This also leaves protocols determined by the fish processors and boat captains to regulate"".

Ambassador Barnes emphasises that the local communities and the regional hospital are not securely equipped with personal protective equipment (PPEs), testing and tracing, ventilators, hospital beds, police enforcement and other necessary protocols to ensure the prevention and protection of the local communities to COVID-19.

""Many of the Bristol Bay communities are separated and isolated and can only reach the Kanakanak Hospital by airplane or by boat"", he says. ""The hospital receives mainly federal funding from Washington and it is not enough to serve the health and safety needs to all communities"".

The Bristol Bay region has had no reported COVID cases until 15 May, when a Trident fish processing company worker from out of state tested positive in Dillingham, elaborates Geoffrey D. Strommer, a US lawyer specialising in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) implementation. Stressing that the fishery industry has already brought COVID-19 to villages in the region, he draws attention to the fact that during the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic, 80% of the deaths in Alaska were Alaska Natives.

Even before the pandemic the health infrastructure of the Bristol Bay had not been constructed or staffed, or funded to cover thousands of seasonal workers: ""We already have huge unmet needs for health care funding, and this crisis only serves to highlight the disparities and shortages"", the lawyer underscores.

To complicate matters further, not all villages in Bristol Bay have running water or sewage and wastewater treatment facilities, he continues, adding that families often have to share very small housing units in overcrowded conditions which makes self-isolation almost impossible amid the pandemic.

Remote location makes life necessities hard to get and very expensive. Likewise, digital communications in the region cost quite a bit which dramatically diminish the affordability of telemedicine and distant educational services for Alaska Natives, the lawyer highlights.

According to some estimates there were 120,000 indigenous people in the state in 2013 which constitutes approximately 15.4% of the overall Alaskan population. ""Alaska Natives are the original inhabitants of the region, with knowledge of the resources, biology, terrain and lifeways to be able to live and thrive here since time immemorial"", Strommer emphasises, stressing that outside industries negatively impact ""local Alaska Natives' capacity to live a subsistence lifestyle"".

""Both the state and federal government, if they value what Bristol Bay brings to the regional and global economy through its fisheries, need to step up and invest further in local infrastructure so that the region has more substantial access to health care, housing, clean water and sewer, electricity, internet and mobile data, and education and law enforcement"", the attorney observes.

'Alaska Natives Have the Right to Govern Their Territories'

If the US state and federal government can't provide the indigenous people with protection and decent standards of living they should let Alaska Natives to take the reins of the region in terms of lawmaking, governance and natural resources management, argues Ambassador Ronald Barnes who has been spearheading the initiative of Alaska's self-determination and self-governance for several years.

""The lack of preparedness and infrastructure to provide enough health care is based on the failure to implement international legal and political status and obligations by the United States of America to Alaska"", he stresses. ""The US has and continues to exploit more than a trillion dollars of resource from Alaska"".

Referring to the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) and the 1867 Treaty of Cession of Alaska the ambassador emphasises that neither of these acts grant the US with the rights of jurisdiction and ownership of the region's territories. He underlines that these rights solely belong to the indigenous peoples of Alaska, in accordance with diplomatic communications between the Russian Empire and the US in which the Alaska indigenous people were declared as ""independent tribes inhabiting an independent territory"".

""The extraction of resources and unilateral taking of territory without the proper consent of a state of peoples based on the denial of self-determination and self-government on grounds of racial discrimination is a crime against humanity"", argues the ambassador. ""The Indigenous Peoples of Alaska have the right of full diplomatic recognition under the political question doctrine at high levels with the United States Government and with the international community"".

Five years ago, Ambassador Barnes raised the issue in the United Nations together with the representatives of indigenous populations of Hawaii. As both Alaska and Hawaii were listed in 1946 as Non Self-Governing Territories under article 73 of the UN Charter, this status subjected Alaska and Hawaii to ""decolonization"". Irregularities in the referendum on Alaska's status as the US' 49th state throw the Alaska Statehood Act signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in July 1958 into question and require the region's re-enlistment to the List of Non-Self-Governing Territories, according to Barnes.

In 2013 and 2014 the criteria for exercising the right of self-determination by Alaska Natives were laid down by Professor Alfred de Zayas, then UN Independent Expert on International Order, who argued that the peoples of Alaska can invoke the right. According to the professor, ""the US government's failure to provide Alaska Natives with adequate health services before and during the COVID pandemic is incompatible with Article 25 of the 1989 ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention 169, the 2007 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous peoples, and general principles of international human rights law"".

Ambassador Ronald Barnes concludes: ""The denial to grant proper recognition and respect to the Tribal Governments and for their right to development, particularly in developing law and policy by the proper agents and authorities, is contrary to the obligations of the United States under Article 1 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights"".

Although sources close to the Palestinian leader told Israel Hayom newspaper that the intentions of the leader to end all cooperation with Israel and the US were ""serious"", they also stated that his assertion was mostly declarative and George Jaqman, Director of the Ramallah-based Institute for Democratic Studies, believes it is unlikely that Mahmoud Abbas will go ahead with the move.

Abbas Cries Wolf Again

""He can say whatever he wants in the media but the truth is that we simply don't know whether Abbas has a strategic plan to implement his declaration. We will only believe it if we see its practical implementation on the ground,"" Jagman explained.

However, that might prove a difficult task. Since the establishment of the Palestinian Authority in 1993, Ramallah has cooperated with Tel Aviv on various levels, including that of security, helping the Jewish state thwart major terrorist attacks.

Last November, for example, the PA allegedly handed Tel Aviv ""crucial information"" that led to the tracking and subsequent elimination of a top Islamic Jihad commander, Baha Abu Al Atta.

But the security cooperation has also helped the PA. In recent years, Hamas, which has been competing with Abbas' Fatah, has stepped up its efforts to challenge the Palestinian leadership, planning attacks on their security personnel.

According to reports, the Palestinian leader's life has also been in danger ""at least twice"" with Israel's inner spy agency the Shin Bet helping Ramallah to foil his assassination and keep the militants of Hamas and other extremist groups in check.

That's why, believes the expert, Abbas' declaration -- that has been used on a multiple occasions in the past but has never materialised -- is merely aimed at giving ""a green light"" to the Palestinians, urging them to take to the streets and clash with Israelis, hoping that the escalation of tensions would force Israel to back down from its plans to incorporate more West Bank territory.

Back to Armed Struggle?

According to a recent poll conducted by the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research, 94 percent of Palestinians expressed their strong rejection of the peace plan rolled by US President Donald Trump in January, that presupposed major land swaps and the extension of Israel's sovereignty over predominantly Palestinian areas.

The same survey found that 77 percent of respondents were supportive of the idea of ending the PA's security cooperation with Israel, whereas 64 percent said they were in favour of resorting to an armed struggle to force Tel Aviv to scrap its expansion plans.

For Jaqman, however, attempts to drive the Palestinians out to the streets are ""not realistic"" simply because the reality on the ground has changed, he believes.

""In the past, Palestinians were able to clash with Israeli soldiers face to face because Israel's security personnel was positioned inside Palestinian towns, whereas now they opt to stay on the outskirts of cities which makes it more difficult for the Palestinians to reach and confront them.""

To minimise losses, Israel has also erected a fence separating its territories from the Palestinians. The 708 kilometre-long barrier -- constructed in the wake of the Second Intifada (2000-2005) -- has managed to significantly decrease the number of Palestinian infiltrations, putting an end to a wave of terror attacks that engulfed the country in the early 2000s.

However, the implementation of security measures is far from the only factor that keeps Palestinians at home, says the pundit. In March, when the first coronavirus cases started popping up, the PA implemented a series of strict measures including a full lockdown of towns and cities to contain the spread of the pandemic, thus bringing the interaction between the Palestinian crowds and Israeli security forces to a minimum.

""Add this to the fact that the economic situation in the West Bank has deteriorated and you will understand why people will choose to refrain from an armed struggle despite polls that show overwhelming support for these tactics,"" explained Jaqman.

""The key for solving the problem and preventing Israel from going ahead with its plans lies within the Palestinian leadership, not the masses. It is only them who can stop Tel Aviv's intentions,"" he added.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu plans to hold a vote on the bill extending sovereignty over the Jordan Valley, that makes up some 30 percent of the predominantly Palestinian West Bank, in early July.

The bill will need to pass three readings before it becomes a law. If it does, the practical meaning of that would be that Israel will not only absorb some 65 thousand Palestinians who live in the area but will also gain full control over an agriculturally important piece of land which is considered pivotal for the economy of an independent Palestinian state.

Sovereignty over this area will also mean that Israel now needs to go through a long and bureaucratic procedure to approve construction and will be able to shorten these processes, enabling a relatively quick Jewish expansion.

Trump also claimed that cutting off relations with China would save the United States some $500 billion.

Dr Paul Craig Roberts, an American economist who served as the United States assistant secretary of the treasury for economic policy, has shared his views on the matter.

Sputnik: In a recent interview, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressed that the percentage of GDP shrinkage in the second quarter is ""going to be very high"", even as much as 20 percent. How can the US sustain its economy during the crisis?

Dr Paul Craig Roberts: All economies that had closedowns are experiencing shrinkages, even Sweden, a country that did not impose a mandatory closedown to the same extent. The Swedish people on their own closed the economy in an effort to protect themselves from infection. America’s economic problem is deeper and more long term than COVID-19.

American corporations offshored many manufacturing and professional skill jobs. These are high value-added, high productivity jobs that produced middle class incomes. These jobs were the ladders of upward mobility. When the jobs were sent abroad, the middle class underwent shrinkage and so did consumer disposable income or purchasing power, which lowered economic growth.

The movement abroad of jobs also reduced the state, local, and federal tax base. There was shrinkage in funding for state and local social services and infrastructure. Debt grew. To sustain aggregate demand, the Federal Reserve used an increase in consumer debt as a substitute for the missing growth in consumer income. This policy could work only until consumers were too indebted — mortgage, car, credit card, student loans — to be able to take on any more debt. Debt service used up consumer incomes, leaving little discretionary spending to drive the economy and leading to the current situation of ""debt deflation"".

Debt deflation is a situation of falling income and employment because debt service uses up the income left after meeting basic needs of food and housing. To correct this problem requires US corporations to bring the offshored jobs back home. That is, the solution requires the end of globalism.

Sputnik: The only economy that is now starting to recover is the Chinese economy. How great are the chances that China could overtake the US as the global economic leader? What would the reaction by the US administration be to this?

Dr Paul Craig Roberts: In terms of purchasing power parity, the Chinese economy is larger than the US economy. Unless China adopts the American practice of offshoring its manufacturing and professional skill jobs, China will continue to move further ahead of the US.

Sputnik: In the event we see further growth in the Chinese economy, shaking up American hegemony, how likely is it that we’ll see further pushback from the US towards China, such as going back to a trade war, imposing tariffs for example, or trying to pin the blame for the coronavirus on Beijing?

Dr Paul Craig Roberts: The so-called ""trade war"" and tariffs imposed on imports from China are a misconception of the problem. The White House mistakenly sees the US trade deficit with China as the result of unfair Chinese trading practices. What the White House does not understand is that the ""Chinese imports"" are the products of US corporations, such as Apple, Nike, and Levi, that are produced abroad for sale in the US. When the US corporations bring their products to the US, they count as imports. So the fact is that it is the global US corporations, not China, that are responsible for the trade deficit. Instead of blaming China and worsening US-China relations, President Trump should be blaming US corporations.

Sputnik: There’s been an ongoing argument that the Chinese political and economic model is the key to “success” in containing the flow and aftermath of COVID-19. To what extent would you agree with this? Has the Chinese model indeed proven its viability, despite being sharply criticised around the world?

Dr Paul Craig Roberts: Economists and politicians do not understand what the ""Chinese Model"" is. It is more than a mixed economy of government and private companies developing according to a strategic plan. The most important part of the Chinese Model is the manufacturing capability, technology, and business know-how given to the Chinese by the US corporations that moved their production to China. A large part of the US economy was simply ripped out of the US and sent to China. This is the reason that China progressed so much more rapidly than anyone thought possible.

Sputnik: In your opinion, which countries have been able to contain the outbreak, both saving the lives of their citizens and protecting their economies? How might the global rating of economies be reshuffled in light of this?

The COVID-19 infection and mortality statistics are not very good, which makes comparisons unreliable. Generally, testing is not widespread and the tests are not always accurate. Moreover, deaths are counted differently. What does seem to be clear is that Asian countries, such as China and South Korea, did a better job of responding to the virus and controlling its spread.

The US and Europe were slow to respond and were unprepared despite knowing what was happening in China. Possibly also, the Chinese and Korean populations are more homogeneous and more cooperative with government than the disparate, multicultural populations that massive immigration has created in North America and Western Europe. These countries are essentially Towers of Babel, which impedes cooperation.

We must never let this happen because if we do, humanity is dead.

Never let a good crisis go to waste the famous quote goes and it seems that some people are trying to use the COVID-19 pandemic to radically reorganise how we live our lives.

""We can’t go back to how we lived before"" has been common refrain these last few weeks, but while of course not all aspects of life pre-COVID-19 were perfect, it was still a lot more enjoyable than ‘lockdown’ has been. Man is a social animal. Yet in Britain since 23rd March, we’ve basically been prohibited from having a social life.

Most of us have been stuck at home, with the most minimal contact with other human beings outside of our immediate family circle. Most have borne this unnatural state of affairs quite well because they thought it was for the public good. But what is really sinister is that power elites seem to want social distancing measures to continue even after the virus has run its course - which in Britain it already looks to have done.

It’s as if they want to take social atomisation to the next level. ID politics and greed-fuelled neo-liberalism seek to divide us spiritually - now we are to be separated from each other physically.

""I think we all recognise now social distancing is here to stay,"" Priti Patel said on ‘Good Morning Britain’ earlier this week.

Do we, Ms Patel? I certainly don’t, and judging by the criticism your comments received on social media, more people agree with me than they do with you.

She continued ‘Our lives are going to be very different’.

Well, she’s right on one point: a life in which ‘social distancing’ was permanent would be different. It would be hell on earth. Imagine a world in which grandparents couldn’t hug their grandchildren, or in which people couldn’t hug their parents, or closest friends? A world where we could never pat someone on the back, or shake their hands? If social distancing was ‘here to stay’, as Patel seems to want, how are couples ever going to come together? The human species would become extinct within a generation. Or perhaps Patel believes AI is our future? If so, what a chilling prospect.

Never in a million years will I accept this pic.twitter.com/nPDyvPp0qX — Are You Awake Yet (@Joannew68022274) May 14, 2020

​In their paper 'Covid-19 The Downside of Social Distancing,' Professor Ophelia Deroy of Ludwig-Maxmilians University, Munich, and her co-authors point out that the demand for social distancing ‘runs counter to the evolved structure of human cognition.’

And that ‘hazardous conditions - make us more - and not less - social’.

Think back to the moments in your life when you felt most alive. It’s very likely it was when you were close to other people. Perhaps it was when you were at a football match and your team scored in stoppage time to pull off a dramatic victory to win a major tournament.

Or at a pop concert, when you saw your favourite group. Or at a party when you danced till dawn with the man/woman of your dreams? Or perhaps it was when you had a chance encounter with a stranger on a train or a plane, or in a pub or nightclub, one that blossomed into romance.

If ‘social distancing’ becomes the ‘new normal’ none of these experiences would take place. Just about the only new friendships, we could forge would be online ones.

One of the very worst things about the Covid-19 outbreak is the way it has made human beings so wary of each other. OMG! Someone is coming towards me on the pavement, I’d better cross to the other side - I might catch the virus!

The only sane solution to the human condition - as the wisest philosophers throughout the ages have concluded - is love. But ‘social distancing’ is anti-love. It keeps us apart when we should be coming together.

When I messaged him about Priti Patel’s statement on Good Morning Britain’ a good friend of mine replied: ‘This is going to cause a big rise in suicide if it is long term.’ He is of course right. Who indeed would want to live in a world where physical contact with other humans was not allowed?

'No Sex Please, We’re British' was the name of a popular farce back in the 1970s, it would be the reality if we are to keep two metres apart from each other forever.

Alas, it’s not just Priti Patel coming out with such cold, misanthropic statements. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said that there should be no hugging until a coronavirus vaccine is developed.

But Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said such a vaccine may never be found. Are we really expected not to embrace anyone for the rest of our lives?

In his 1955 work The Sane Society, the great social scientist Erich Fromm wrote: ‘The danger of the past was that men became slaves. The danger of the future was that men may become robots’. How real that threat is now, as politicians and public figures seek to exploit fears about a virus to present anti-human, sociopathic practices as ‘the new normal.’

In fact, there could be nothing more abnormal than what Patel and co are suggesting. If there is any distancing to be done- we need to do it from those who would strip us of our common humanity.

The Prime Minister’s dice with death and time spent in intensive care has evidently changed his mind-set when it comes to intervening in public health. Like me, years ago, he saw initiatives like the sugar tax as part of the Nanny state and he was dead against it.

However, according to James Forsyth writing in the Times today Johnson’s had a major change of heart and it has been driven by the now undeniable link between coronavirus and obesity. He is convinced that the reason he ended up in intensive care was because of his weight.

This change of heart echoes what top cardiologist, Dr Aseem Malhotra has been campaigning about for years and it is urgent that the views of Aseem are now taken very seriously at the top of Government as there is no time to waste.

Pioneers like Aseem and Dr David Unwin have now proved that Type 2 diabetes is not an irreversible, lifelong chronic disease and that it can be tackled with lifestyle and diet changes, not more and more drugs.

Boris has come to the same conclusion as Aseem Malhotra that one of the main reasons why the UK has been so hard hit by Coronavirus is just how obese the UK population is. There is no denying that Obesity is the second biggest coronavirus risk factor, after age, and more than a quarter of Brits are obese.

Listen to the Experts

Aseem Malhotra’s was my guest on my sputnik radio show last week, listen here.

He explained that there's a very strong link between conditions like type two diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and increasing death rates from COVID-19.

Aseem believes that our nations’ diet with its reliance on fast food and ultra-processed food is one of the major factors behind our obesity crisis and is strongly linked to a whole host of other diseases. He favours a move to a more Mediterranean style of diet and is a supporter of eating a low carbohydrate high fat diet.

He believes this style of eating can fundamentally change our health and is a believer that Type 2 diabetes can be reversed in this manner.

He told me in last week’s show that “current NHS guidelines haven't caught up with the science. What I would say though, interestingly, is new evidence suggests for Type 2 diabetes, specifically, that a low carbohydrate diet is a safe and effective option, but the problem is, it's not well publicized.""

Dr Malhotra stunned me when he also stated that the public aren't aware that the present dietary guidance is not independently formulated and companies like Coca Cola, Kellogg's, Pepsi, McDonald's, amongst many others directly influence the guidance. He says ""they are not there to look after your health, they're certainly not there to protect you from getting Type 2 diabetes or obesity, in fact, the opposite in a way because they want to make money by selling you more food. The question is, why are they involved in making up what's supposed to be independent guidance? And that for me that is the real scandal.""

Big Sugar Fake

This is a point that has been taken up today on Twitter by former Tory Minister, David Davies who tweeted, ‘Good to see Boris taking obesity seriously now. But he had better be sure the science behind any policy is right. Quite a lot of evidence that all Western governments have based guidance on bad science for 50 years. We must review the science first, then act.’

He is correct that thee science is not only outdated but it was fake from day one and funded by the sugar industry.

Effectively in the 1960’s the sugar industry paid scientists to play down the link between sugar and heart disease and instead to promote the idea that saturated fat was the driver of heart disease.

This fake news or “science” then shaped five decades of nutritional advice and dietary recommendations. In other words, Big Sugar controlled the agenda and many say they still do!

Look at the Evidence

It was also good to see Labour’s ex Deputy Leader, Tom Watson give his support too by tweeting, ‘David is right on this, we need independently funded nutritional science. There’s so much more we can do to unify the nation on this agenda.’

The thing that unites these two political heavyweights is the fact that both lost tons of weight (8 stone in Watson’s case) by following a low carbohydrate high fat diet combined with gentle exercise.

According to the Times' article today Boris favours getting everyone on a bike to promote fitness and weight loss but he should heed the wise words of Professor Tim Noakes of the University of Johannesburg who states unequivocally that you cannot out run (or out cycle) a bad diet. Its’ what we eat that is the primary driver of obesity.

If Boris is still not convinced he should have a word with his health secretary, Matt Hancock, who declared at the World Economic Forum in China on September 19 2018 that he had lost 2 stone in 3 months by cutting out carbs from his diet.

He said, ""It is clear that obesity is one of the rising challenges for the health of the nation, the links between obesity, diabetes and to cancer are increasingly clear.”

“We need to ensure that people don’t always reach to the medicinal solution. Losing weight, activity and eating better are there of the best things that you can do to tackle obesity.” He also praised Tom Watson calling him “an example to many.”

If Boris wants more evidence he could always give me a call, as I too have reversed my Type 2 diabetes, got my blood pressure into the normal range and solved a myriad of other health issues by adopting a low carb high fat lifestyle combined with gentle walking.

I was a type 2 diabetic for 15 years, weighing in at the best part of 22 stone and on at least ten tablets a day.

Stop Dietary Genocide

I’m not alone as people all around the globe are doing it for themselves but still the dietary guidelines push the concept of the Eatwell plate and tell us to eat starchy carbs. It is sugar and starchy carbs (which turn to glucose) that is the enemy, not fat.

Obesity is not just costing lives it is also costing the NHS billions and many experts believe if Type 2 cases continue to rise it could effectively bankrupt the NHS.

At the moment the Annual spend on the treatment of obesity and diabetes is greater than the amount spent on the police, the fire service and the judicial system combined.

Type 2 diabetes and obesity is killing more people than Covid19 and Professor Tim Noakes has even gone so far as to describe the present dietary guidelines as a “genocide.”

Covid-19 caught us unaware and unprepared but there is no need for Type 2 diabetes and Obesity to do the same. We know the problem and we know the fix. Boris let’s get it done now. Let’s change the dietary guidelines now.

Former Argentina international Agustin Pichtot has announced that he will be resigning from the World Rugby Council.

The move comes after he was defeated by Englishman Sir Bill Beaumont in the World Rugby Federation’s leadership election, which took place on the second of May.

In a statement on the Argentine Rugby Union’s website, Pichot outlined his reasons for doing do.

""The only reason I have been a part of World Rugby to this day, and which in turn is the same one that has moved me to run for president, is the conviction that World Rugby needs change, but my proposal, which I fervently believe in, has not been chosen, and that is why I choose to step aside, I cannot conceive of occupying a place just for the sake of occupying it,"" Pichot stated.

The Argentine’s World Rugby Federation leadership bid was based on reforming the game’s governance, which he felt overly favoured traditionally strong teams such as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, France and England, and hence stymied the development of the sport in other countries.

Among Pichot’s proposals was the idea to introduce a promotion and relegations system for the Six Nations; Europe’s flagship international Rugby tournament , in order to potentially grant smaller teams in the continent the chance to take on the established titans of the sport.

The manifesto of Sir Bill Beaumont however, proved to be more popular, as he was largely in favour of maintaining the status quo within Rugby, with his most radical proposal being to allow players from countries such as Fiji, Samoa and Tonga to represent their home nations after turning out for bigger sides, in pursuit of international trophies.

It remains to be seen if Pichot will return to Rugby in another capacity, or if much reform to the sport’s governing bodies will take place, but for now, at least it seems that the World Rugby Federation will plough ahead, and implement the sensible if less radical manifesto of Sir Bill Beaumont.

The old maxim certainly rings true when we consider the life-enhancing things which have disappeared since the Coronavirus lockdown, and whose return would do much to lift our morale.

The Grand National. The FA Cup. The weekend football programme. The climax to the Rugby Six Nations. Wimbledon. The World Snooker Championship. Euro 2020. The Olympic Games. Just some of the great sporting events we’ve missed - or will miss - since Covid-19 left its calling card - and the subsequent lockdowns took effect.

The reaction of most public figures was to say ‘Who cares. Sport doesn’t really matter’. Even those who profess to be sports fans have said we can easily do without it. Piers Morgan, the shy and retiring breakfast television presenter (and Arsenal supporter), has repeatedly opposed plans to complete the 2019/20 football season.

Not only has there been little public support from media ‘Talking Heads’ for sport to return, sporting events have even been blamed for the spread of Covid19. I wrote in a recent Sputnik column on how the Cheltenham National Hunt Racing Festival, which took place from 10-13th March, has been made the Covid-19 fall-guy by many people, even though there was no compelling evidence to back up the claims that holding it was injurious to public health.

There were hopes earlier this month that racing might return behind ‘closed doors’ on 15th May, but the government’s new ‘road map’ for easing the lockdown, published on Monday, put paid to that. Now the earliest we can hope for a return in the UK is early June, and even that must be in some doubt, when one reads the small print.

Two important points are missed by those who say the return of sport should be a very low priority in the current circumstances. Firstly, we’re talking about industries which directly or indirectly many thousands of people and contribute greatly to the economy. Horse-racing for instance brings in between £3.5bn and £4bn. But a lot of jobs in racing will go unless the sport gets back into action soon, with smaller trainers, and the smaller racecourses, facing a very uncertain future.

Secondly, there‘s the enormous positive impact that watching - and playing - sport can have in our daily lives.

Consider this: in a parallel universe this coming Sunday is the final day of the Premiership football season. Think of the excitement we would be enjoying - and all the thrills we‘ve missed these last seven weeks or so.

Without the drama of horse-racing and ´Final Score’, Saturday afternoons in the UK are simply not the same. Last week, the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that the return of sport would ‘lift the spirits of the nation’. For once, he was right - but guess what? He was shouted down.

""You’re an absolute T**T. We don’t need sport to lift the nation"", was one tweeter’s reaction. How well that tweeter would have fitted in in the days of Oliver Cromwell. During the kill-joy rule of the Puritans in the 1650s most sports were banned.

""Despite playing in his youth, the game's (football’s) 'frivolity' didn't fit into Oliver Cromwell's puritanical world"", reports the Guardian.

I’m sure ‘The Lord Protector’ would feel very much at home in the lockdown Britain of today - with its lack of sport, its closed theatres and pubs, and its shut-down places of public entertainment.

A country where even citizens in Warrington doing a socially-distanced conga for VE Day received fierce criticism from the 2020 equivalent of the New Model Army. It seems that having any kind of fun ( apart from clapping outside your front door once a week every Thursday evening), is not allowed in 'Lockdown Britain'.

© AFP 2020 / ISABEL INFANTES An image of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II making her her address to the UK and the Commonwealth in relation to the coronavirus epidemic is displayed on the advertising boards at Piccadilly Circus in central London on April 9, 2020, as Britain continues to battle the outbreak of Coronavirus Covid-19 and warm weather tests the nationwide lockdown as the long Easter weekend approaches. - The disease has struck at the heart of the British government, infected more than 60,000 people nationwide and killed over 7,000, with a daily death toll in England of 765 reported on April 9.

Of course we all need to ‘stay alert’ over Covid19- and take sensible precautions to avoid catching it or passing it on, but surely the existence of a virus doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have any enjoyment at all in our lives? What in fact is ‘saving life’ for, if we don’t enjoy it?

The return of sport would be a wonderful diversion from the depressing diet of ‘fear-porn’ news we are fed on a daily basis. How lovely it would be to once again become engrossed in issues of promotion and relegation. On focusing on who was going to win the 3.35 at Sandown Park, rather than what was going to be said at the daily Covid-19 Press briefings.

Those who dismiss sport as a ‘triviality’ fail to understand that something can be simultaneously both unimportant and important. To some the result of a horse race is of supreme unimportance. But to those who train or look after horses, who ride them, who bet on them, or who follow the form, it’s far more important than many other things. Ditto soccer. Keith Castle was Britain’s first successful heart transplant patient, back in 1979. His first words after regaining consciousness after his operation? ‘How did Fulham get on?’ He was a man who clearly had his priorities right, (if not his choice of football team).

I’d say the return of Saturday football, regular horse-racing, and other sports too, will do more to cheer the country up than any of the po-faced talking heads who oppose such moves. And goodness me, don’t we all need some cheering up at present.

But a practical consequence of such denial-mentality is America will lose the “war” against COVID-19.

On the occasion marking the 75th anniversary of victory over the Nazi Third Reich, the Trump White House made no mention of the Soviet Union’s indisputable military achievement of vanquishing the German fascist regime, instead implying that the US and Britain were the sole victors.

Trump added for vainglorious good measure: “The American spirit will always win. In the end, that’s what happens.”

This outrageous falsification of history takes American absurdity to a whole new exceptional level. There has always been a cloying tendency in US popular culture to overstate the role played by America in defeating Nazi Germany. Hollywood films like ‘Saving Private Ryan’ are unbearable to watch for their vanity and self-regarding Americanism.

But for Trump and his White House to openly claim it was Britain and America that won World War Two without even mentioning the colossal sacrifice of the Soviet Union, really takes the distortion and denial of reality into unchartered territory.

For three years, 1941-44, the Soviet Red Army fought the Nazi Wehrmacht single-handedly. The British and American opening of the Western front with their Normandy landings in June 1944 came as the Nazi regime was crumbling from sustained Soviet counter-offensive and epic battles. Six million Nazi troops were killed in the Eastern Front, compared with one million on the Western Front. The Red Army defeated the elite SS divisions paving the way for the Soviet routing of Hitler’s bunker – the Third Reich’s last stand – in Berlin.

As many as 27 million Soviet citizens died in the heroic war against Nazi Germany, including up to eight million Red Army soldiers. By contrast, the Americans and British each lost less than half a million troops.

Trump’s contemptible ignorance is matched by his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who also used the 75th anniversary to distort the liberation of Europe by the Red Army from Nazi Germany as supposedly leading to a tyrannical occupation by Soviet communism in the postwar decades.

This kind of delusional thinking is not just risible and repugnant. It has practical consequences which can be ruinous. For if the Trump administration can be so disconnected from reality, then its policy choices on other matters will be likewise absurd and dangerous.

Take the administration’s policy of blaming China for the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump and his officials are accusing China for “covering up” and even inflicting the virus on the US. This “logic” is based on fantastic, unscientific myths, which is creating a dangerous slippery-slope towards confrontation.

By pushing China for financial reparations over Covid-19 deaths and economic damage in the US, Trump is in denial over his administration’s abject failings to contend with the epidemic. But so desperate is Trump’s denial of reality, he is talking up an anti-China rationale that inevitably could lead to war.

The same goes for America’s chances of successful recovery from the pandemic. Trump is goading his nation to reopen the economy pretending that it is safe to do so without adequate testing and protections. Of course, this president views complex public health issues through the grubby lens of making financial profit.

While he is urging his country to reopen – in the pretense that the “American spirit will always win” – Trump is ignoring the reality that his own White House has become a hotspot for Covid-19 infection. Three of the administration’s top health experts are in quarantine due to infection fears. Vice President Mike Pence is reportedly self-isolating after his press secretary tested positive for the disease. A valet to Trump has also been infected.

Kevin Hassett, an economic advisor to Trump, told US media at the weekend that the White House West Wing has become a “scary place to work” – such is the increasing risk of administration staffers succumbing to COVID-19.

Trump has previously likened the fight against the disease to a war. He incessantly congratulates himself for handling the epidemic which last week he compared to the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

This president is a walking contradiction from his own delusions and absurdities. He may be right about the “Russiagate"" nonsense and a lot of the “fake news” US corporate news media. We can give him credit on that score. But if Trump can’t even acknowledge the fundamental facts about World War Two and in particular the decisive role played by the Soviet Union, then we should know that his administration is doomed to further failure, specifically in relations with China and in mismanaging the COVID-19 pandemic.

I watched the Boris Johnson show at 7pm with a mixture of rage and pity.

Rage that this man is able to claim the mantle of UK Prime Minister and secure prime time TV to pontificate on a pandemic he has so spectacularly failed to deal with properly since the start of January this year, and pity that he is so obviously out of his political depth that it would be no surprise if Boris is encouraged to ‘spend more time with his family’ in the coming months as the Tories seek to replace him with someone as brutal but more competent. Kermit from the Muppet Show would surely be a contender on the competency front.

Current No1 trending topic in UK tonight is #BorisHasFailed — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) May 10, 2020

Johnson has introduced a new slogan to guide the nation. From the clear and unambiguous Stay At Home – Protect The NHS – Save Lives, with the deliberate red for stop border adding to the serious message being conveyed, we have the wholly unclear, imprecise and confusing Stay Alert – Control The Virus – Save Lives, with the green for go border promoting a different tone and imagery. What the hell does it mean? Stay Alert? An empty, nebulous and shallow slogan that will prompt more questions than answers and lead to greater confusion and indecision precisely when certainty and unequivocal messages are required.

Scotland’s Message Remains Clear – Stay Home. Protect NHS. Save Lives

Nicola Sturgeon is Scotland’s First Minister and she spoke with more clarity and authority earlier in the day when she stated categorically that the Stay Home message remains in place and operational in Scotland. Individuals would be permitted to exercise more often than once from now on but only on their own or with family members and while observing the two-metre social distancing rule. It is not what I or millions of others wanted to hear. I hate the social isolation and Stay Home rules. I am desperate to socialise and spend time with family and friends. But there is absolutely nothing more valuable in life than our health and the health of our families. Those of us lucky enough to still have elderly parents and children of our own comply with the Scottish First Minister’s message because it is underpinned by the best health and science advice available.

What Boris Johnson has done is undermine that critical and clear message and in the process risk even more needless loss of life. It is well documented and a matter of fact that Johnson ignored detailed warnings about the UK’s unpreparedness for a health pandemic. He then acted too slow to impose a social isolation lockdown.

He failed to put in place a proper test, track and trace strategy despite clear warnings to do so. He failed to ensure frontline health and care workers had sufficient and essential Personal Protective Equipment to allow them to safely treat Covid19 victims and care for the most at-risk elderly citizens. And now he is playing fast and loose with the health of thousands of others by “actively encouraging” millions of construction and manufacturing workers to return to work from tomorrow when workplaces and building sites are wholly unprepared and unable to ensure a safe environment for those workers.

Workplaces Are Not Safe – PM Letter of Weeks Ago Still Stands

Millions across England are to be “actively encouraged” to get back to work in cars, bikes and by walking but to avoid using public transport. It is madness. More than that, it is irresponsible and criminally negligent. No instructions about face masks. No guarantees that transport workers will be provided with sufficient PPE. Does he not read the death toll statistics breakdown and realise hundreds of transport workers have already died from exposure to passengers on buses and trains who did not know they were Covid19 carriers?

It was only a few weeks ago hours after it was confirmed on 28th March that more than 1,000 people had died across the UK from Covid19 that PM Boris confirmed he would send out more than 30 million personally signed letters to every household in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland at a cost of £5.7 million urging everyone to Stay Home – I quote directly from that letter:

“THE PRIME MINISTER

“I understand completely the difficulties this disruption has caused to your lives, businesses and jobs. But the action we have taken is absolutely necessary, for one simple reason.

If too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to cope. This will cost lives. We must slow the spread of the disease, and reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment in order to save as many lives as possible.

That is why we are giving one simple instruction – you must stay at home.”

“Thousands of retired doctors and nurses are returning to the NHS – and hundreds of thousands of citizens are volunteering to help the most vulnerable. It is with that great British spirit that we will beat coronavirus and we will beat it together.”

“That is why, at this moment of national emergency, I urge you, please, to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.”

The bold emphasis was in the letter. The one simple message was clear. These letters were issued days after the UK Covid19 death total reached 1,019. On the day of Johnson’s new, ambiguous and vague message the UK recorded 268 more deaths, 3,923 more cases and reached a cumulative total of at least 31,855 citizens lost prematurely to Covid19. Many believe this figure is an underestimate but it is the highest total in Europe and data from the World Health Organisation over the seven days 1st – 8th May indicates that per million of population the UK Covid19 death rate is now the highest in the world, surpassing both the United States and Sweden, 3rd and 2nd largest respectively.

After seven weeks of an emotionally difficult and economically costly lockdown which appears to have at least slowed the rate of infection of the deadly virus now is the time to steady the ship and double down on the message. People’s lives are at stake. Providing sustainable incomes for all workers, self-employed citizens and supporting businesses to prevent closures is easily affordable in a society as rich as the UK. Dipping into the £205 billion put aside to guarantee renewal of Trident nuclear weapons is certainly a readily available stream of cash better used for productive than destructive purposes.

What lies behind Johnson’s Statement tonight is the priorities of the big business bosses and billionaires who are so anxious to see ‘normality’ resumed. Their ‘normality’ consists of millions forced to survive on inadequate wages and welfare payments to guarantee their continued and obscene enrichment. The health of ordinary workers and elderly citizens is irrelevant to them. The new slogan would have been more honest if it read: Back To Work – Catch The Virus – Save The Billionaires; or Confuse The Public – Kill 32,000 – Avoid All Responsibility.

Tonight’s announcement by Boris Johnson is the moment the mask slipped and the entire nation saw Tory ideology win the battle versus public health. Confusion and chaos reign and a second wave will be wholly down to an abject failure of leadership by the PM & Government. — lan Byrne MP (@IanByrneMP) May 10, 2020

Johnson and Trump Vie for Stupid Mayor of Amity Island Title

The stark truth is Boris Johnson, just like his political acolyte Donald Trump, epitomises the stubborn, stupid and selfish Larry Vaughn, Mayor of the fictional Amity Island in the 1975 blockbuster movie Jaws. Never mind the three incidents and two deaths from shark attacks in the previous seven days, including the death of a young boy and girl from the deadly shark, we cannot close the beaches as it would be ‘bad for business’.

The Jaws script is a perfect metaphor for the combined approaches of Johnson and Trump to the current Covid19 threat. Never mind the scientific evidence and real threat to health let us just get everyone back to work as soon as possible. Watch the scene where the Mayor articulates the business community priorities to overrule the police chief and scientific evidence and keep the beaches open regardless of the threat to life:

“We will be open for business. Those beaches will be open for this weekend (July 4th celebrations)”.

Policing Covid 19 has become impossible after today. My colleagues cannot Engage, Explain, Encourage or Enforce such woolly rules. This is now down to the public to Police itself. Please let’s avoid a second spike. @WestYorksPolFed @Cameramal — Brian Booth (@WYPF_Chairman) May 10, 2020

Trump has ordered States across America to ‘open for business’ despite the evidence of mounting deaths and increased risks from infection and Johnson’s message tonight is in a similar vein. He is rushing to get England out of lockdown in homage to the rich business interests who supported him in his general election fight. It is no accident that the US and UK are top of the Covid19 league table of deaths and incompetent responses to the pandemic. However, the gutter press is Johnson’s natural ally and they will weigh in behind him in the coming days and they will seek to undermine the more cautious and concerned Nicola Sturgeon. Hopefully, the Welsh Assembly will continue to put health first over business concerns, but I fear Northern Ireland will fall into line behind their natural political allies in the Tory party.

Boris Johnson Does Not Speak for Scotland

Boris Johnson did not speak for me tonight and he did not speak for Scotland. He spoke only for England and the narrow section of millionaires and billionaires who back his political philosophy. The fact some within his party are discontented with the pace of relaxing the lockdown and returning to their ‘normal’ is further evidence of the ruthless and callous brutality which pollutes the Tory party. I sincerely hope the people of Scotland stick with the health first message of Nicola Sturgeon and reject the big business priorities of Boris Johnson and his political party.

According to officials in Shizuoka prefecture, whose boundary with Yamanashi prefecture Mount Fuji straddles, three of four main routes to the volcanic mountain’s peak will be shut down during the summer months, which comprise the climbing season.

The decision comes after officials in the Yamanashi prefecture announced that the Yoshida trail, the most popular route for climbing Mount Fuji, would also be closed.

The cabins along the routes, which are used by resting climbers, will remain closed this summer.

The Indian Navy has announced its operational preparedness, but there are severe costs for the anti-China maritime posture in the region.

The Chinese Ministry of National Defence (MND) announced the deployment of the 690 naval personnel-strong 35th Task Force of the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) to the Gulf of Aden on Wednesday in order to carry out anti-piracy patrols in the Indian Ocean, which is considered India’s geopolitical sphere of influence.

The PLAN's guided missile destroyer the Taiyan and the frigate Jingzhou will for the first time ever protect ""ships and vessels” passing through the region.

The task force, comprising at least two dozen naval helicopters and replenishment oiler the Chaohu, will also support vessels off the coast of Somalia, where the PLAN has been carrying out naval escort missions since December 2008.

The announcement comes at a time when the International Maritime Bureau’s latest global piracy report shows zero hijackings in the last two quarters and no incidents around Somalia. Global shipping data also suggest a massive decline in the number of ships calling on ports, including in Europe and China.

Explaining the purpose of such a deployment at this time, Captain D.K. Sharma, who retired from the Indian Navy in September 2019 after serving as the spokesperson for 10 years, tells Sputnik: “The foothold which the PLA Navy established in 2008 in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), in the garb of anti-piracy missions, won't be diluted at any cost”.

The captain brings up Beijing’s strategy – termed the ""String of Pearls"" by the US consultancy Booz Allen Hamilton in its 2005 report “Energy Futures in Asia” – to expand its naval presence throughout the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) by building maritime civilian infrastructure in friendly countries.

“It (String of Pearls) was a well thought-out strategy. Also, they (Beijing) have interests in the Indian Ocean Region with Djibouti, Gwadar, Myanmar Bangladesh etc., as part of their One Belt One Road programme. Anti-piracy patrol is an alibi to cover up their other designs in the overall scheme of things”, the captain says.

Ever since the 2005 report, many strategic analysts have also termed it as a strategy to encircle India, which has a dominant position in the Indian Ocean Region. However, China has denied any such strategy.

“Happy Hunting” Has Its Cost

The Indian Navy has clearly indicated that it will not lose its stance in the Indian Ocean Region, despite the battle against COVID-19.

Stating the impact of China in the Indian Ocean Region, former Indian Navy spokesperson Sharma says: “Presence of Chinese PLA Navy ships in Indian Ocean Region [does] make a difference to [the] Indian Navy as they have to keep a constant eye on their movements. These ships are involved in many other activities apart from normal patrols in Gulf of Aden”.

For the second time in a month, when it is assisting civilian authorities in the fight against COVID-19, the Indian Navy released a statement on 18 April stating: “Our assets continue to remain on patrol covering a vast oceanic swath from the Straits of Malacca in the East to Bab-el-Mandeb in the West, including undertaking Operation Sankalp to provide reassurance and protection to our merchant vessels and anti-piracy patrols in Gulf of Aden”.

Sharma also states that this will only add a financial burden on the Indian Navy, which has also increased its strategic co-operation of-late to counter China.

Apart from incurring huge costs on operating around 50 combat-ready warships — destroyers, frigates, corvettes, large patrol vessels — and daily sorties by Poseidon P-8I maritime patrol aircraft, which are now permanently positioned in the Indian Ocean Region, the “mission-based deployment” also wears out the Indian Navy’s combat assets and trained personnel.

Indian Navy commanders have raised concerns over critical capability gaps in ship-borne helicopters, fleet support ships, and submarines. This means that continuous deployment of these assets raises the possibility of accidents and encounters at sea.

These concerns compound the already existing financial crisis caused by COVID-19, as a top official of India's Defence Ministry told Sputnik that the defence budget is being reduced by 20-30 percent this year.

For 2020, the Navy received around $3 billion for revenue expenditures and around $3.8 billion for capital expenditures, which is $3 billion lower than the projected expenditure this year. The Navy had already pulled back its requirement of Mine Counter Measure Vessels, helicopters, and P-8I reconnaissance aircraft.

Naval Deployments for All

The two Asian giants have emphasised time and again that their naval deployments are not only for their own purposes, but they can provide assistance to their friendly neighbours as well.

As China despatched its naval combat force — the first time in four years — consisting of around a dozen warships, India called off any strong action against the then Abdulla Yameen government, which was considered pro-China.

Past incidents suggest that such deployments come in handy in times of crisis to governments having close relations with Beijing. This was evident in 2018, when the Abdulla Yameen government announced a state of emergency in the Maldives and India had to rush its aircraft and ships to its southern bases.

However, India has been moving forward to establish a new base on Assumptions Island in the Seychelles and negotiated military access to naval facilities at ports in Oman and Indonesia last year.

COVID-19 Challenges to Navy

Indian Navy Chief Karambir Singh told commanders in a video message on 7 March that “it can no longer be business as usual”.

Hence, the Chinese deployment in a time of crisis poses a big challenge for the Indian Navy, whose warships are teeming with men more than other navies — as evident during the multilateral exercise — to operate in full capability while maintaining physical distancing to remain COVID-19-free.

The nation's banking regulator has indicated that growth in the current financial year (April 2020 - March 2021) will remain in the negative.

Despite facing a revenue crunch itself due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Indian Finance Ministry has said that there is no proposal to impose a calamity cess to higher revenues in the fight against the pandemic.

Sources in the ministry said that given the economic scenario amid the pandemic, an additional cess will be an ""adversity"" in itself.

A source in the Ministry of Finance said that a proposal like this would prove to be counter-productive, as with the varying degrees of lockdown across the country, sales are already at low volume. Indian PM Narendra Modi imposed the lockdown on 25 March. The national lockdown will continue until 31 May, with some relaxation to industrial, construction, and other service sectors.

""Industry is already facing a deep crisis for want of demand and likely labour challenges that might come in near future due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, tinkering with the taxes or cess would not be a prudent option at all"", the source added.

The Indian government has taken a massive hit to its revenues because of the COVID-19 pandemic, so much so that it has not released the monthly collections of Goods and Services Tax (GST) for the month of April. In March, the Indian government brought in revenue worth $13 billion.

A Finance Ministry official told Sputnik, ""There has been a very bad impact on GST revenue for the month of April"". The official said that April GST revenue is down by at least 66 percent compared with March.

Due to the impact of the pandemic the ministry is staring at a revenue gap on both direct as well indirect tax collection for the current financial year. The net tax target of $218.12 billion planned in the budget on 1 Feb is difficult to achieve now, contends the ministry official.

However, to compensate for losses on account of the pandemic-led slowdown, the Indian government has recently enhanced this year's borrowing from the budgeted $104 million to $160 million.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

First Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia Alice Wells, who is resigning in May, has accused China of using border clashes with India to change the status quo at the border.

On 20 May, Alice Wells, a US ambassador, spoke at an online conference at the Atlantic Council, one of America's leading think tanks, regarding the border standoff between India and China.

Talking to Rish Verma, the US Ambassador to India from 2014-2017, she drew parallels between the confrontation in the Himalayas and the situation regarding the disputed South China Sea.

The diplomat called China's actions on the border with India, as well as in the South China Sea, ""constant aggression"", ""constant attempts"" to change existing norms and the status quo, Business Insider India cited her as saying.

She then called to counter China, both in the South China Sea and on India's land and sea borders, while adding that the increased presence of the Chinese military on the border, where temporary clashes are quite common, has caused concern on the Indian side. According to her, the issue is becoming more acute in light of Beijing's efforts to ""evade responsibility and spread misinformation"".

Many analysts believe that the United States has always been interested in maintaining tensions between India and China. This is one of the tools to implement their Indo-Pacific strategy, aimed, among other things, at strengthening the country's influence in South Asia, Andrei Volodin, an IMEMO RAS expert, professor at the Diplomatic Academy of the Russian Foreign Ministry, pointed out:

""The statement (by the American ambassador) is just one example. Moreover, this statement obviously fits into the Trump administration's current general strategy to discredit China as the 'source' of the coronavirus pandemic. The US, which is conducting an anti-Chinese campaign, is now trying to involve the maximum number of not only their satellites in Western Europe, but also the maximum number of Asian states. Asian countries, in general, react quite neutrally to these attempts"".

At the same time, the expert ruled out the possibility that US support for India in the border conflict with China could provoke it to take unilateral action. In the context of the epidemiological crisis, even the Indian military believes that it's necessary to focus as much as possible on the economy and development.

They are ready to come to terms with the fact that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is redistributing forces and assets in favour of the civilian sector.

""In addition, the experience of the 1962 war and subsequent conflicts between China and India is not in India's favour"", Andrei Volodin said.

China's restraint and its ability to achieve mutual understanding with India frustrate Washington's strategic goal of them coming into conflict, as Delhi appreciates its independence and is unlikely to want Washington to use it as a tool to contain Beijing, Wang Peng from the People's University of China said, commenting on the US diplomat's statements:

""The Indo-Pacific Strategy is the key strategy among the Trump administration's global foreign policy aims. In June 2017, there was a standoff between China and India in Doklam, and in November of the same year, the United States introduced the concept of the Indo-Pacific Strategy at the APEC meeting in Vietnam. There were only a few months between those events. It is no coincidence that many analysts believe that the Sino-Indian confrontation could have affected the development of Trump's strategy. The US has never stopped trying to form a political 'square' consisting of the United States, Japan, India, and Australia to deter China"".

© AP Photo / Manish Swarup U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi embrace after giving a joint statement in New Delhi, India, Tuesday, Feb. 25, 2020.

""Meanwhile, China maintains restraint and seeks mutual understanding with the Indian side; therefore the United States cannot achieve its strategic goals. The Trump administration relies heavily on provoking disputes and increased tension between certain countries and China to achieve its own goals, which allows the United States to make these countries even more strategically dependent. However, the problem is that the US strategy is contrary to India's national interests and cultural traditions. India really appreciates its independence and doesn't want to be used as a tool"".

The provocative nature of Alice Well's statement is obvious given the difficult situation in the northwest section of the Line of Actual Control between China and India. In fact, her words can even be regarded as US support for India's territorial claims against China, which could make the situation on the Sino-Indian border even more explosive. This month there have already been two, albeit minor, clashes involving dozens of military personnel from both sides.

Additional defensive structures are also being constructed on both sides of the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh, which also increases the tension. The other day, the Chinese military reported that India had built fortifications to deliberately foment conflict and unilaterally modify the existing border control system. The Global Times reported, citing a source in the PLA, that it had successfully restored the status quo in the Galwan Valley.

For its part, the Indian Express reported on 20 May that tensions along the Sino-Indian border in Ladakh near lake Pangong Tso had increased. According to the Indian newspaper, the Chinese military had tripled the number of patrol boats in the area to match the number of Indian craft in the waters off the western shore of the lake.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

They were staying in Gurgaon, on the outskirts of Delhi. Jyoti’s mother and elder sister and family had managed to return to their village in Darbhanga in Bihar ahead of the lockdown.

An Indian girl's feat of pedalling over 1,200 kilometres with an injured father has caught the attention of the Cycling Federation of India, which has now offered to take her on for training to be a professional cyclist.

“When we came to know that she has pedalled, that too with her father and some luggage, to cover 1,200 kilometres in seven days, we felt it was something extraordinary. It showed her endurance. So we thought, if she has such stamina, why don’t we give her a chance"", Onkar Singh, Chairman of the Cycling Federation of India told Sputnik.

“We have talked to her and explained our process. She said she is under quarantine now, but wants to follow her studies. We told her that our system of training is inclusive of academic studies and trains them in competitive cycling as well"", he said.

Onkar Singh said the Cycling Federation scouts for talent across the country between the ages 14-17, takes care of their training, education, boarding, and lodging and once they are ready to hit the track, nominate them for competitions at the national and international level.

Jyoti bought a used bicycle for a little over $25 and decided to carry her father on it all the way to her village 1,200 kilometres away, after their landlord asked them to vacate their home since they were unable to pay the rent. It took eight days for the young teenager to pedal all the way to Darbhanga from Gurgaon.

Jyoti's father, an electric rickshaw driver had experienced an accident before the lockdown and was confined to his home. The father and daughter managed to survive for two months, but once the landlord asked them to vacate the premises, there was no other option for the duo.

Social media, meanwhile, has been all praise for the girl for her grit and determination. US President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka tweeted, “This beautiful feat of endurance and love has captured the imagination of the Indian people and the cycling federation!""

The actual fiscal stimulus in the package is about $24 billion, which is less than one percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - equivalent to India's total goods and services.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown has brought the economic activity to a complete standstill for about two months now. Even as lockdown relaxations have been eased by the Indian Home Ministry, the country's apex bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday hinted at negative Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in the current financial year, which ends next March.

This represents the first recognition by any Indian government entity of the fact that the country is staring at an economic recession, which is technically two consecutive quarters of negative growth.

Without providing any guidance or range in which the Indian growth will contract in the current financial year due to the pandemic, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said, “GDP growth in 2020-21 is estimated to remain in negative territory, with some pick-up in growth impulses from the second half (October 2020 – March 2021) onwards. Much will depend on how quickly the COVID curve flattens and begins to moderate”.

Experts, however, believe that the fact that there is going to be a recession due to the pandemic is a given. The question is how deep is it going to be?

Indian Prime Minister Modi, in a televised address on 24 March, announced a national lockdown at a four hours’ notice. The economy has remained shut ever since then with some relaxations like allowing factories and industrial units to open up with limited staff.

The Indian railway ministry has also started limited passenger services and the ministry of civil aviation has allowed limited flights to begin operating from 25 May.

Even though the macroeconomic data for April, the first month of the financial year, hasn’t been published yet, the Indian government’s March data on some macro indicators reveals that the crisis is deep.

A week’s lockdown in March completely wiped out the industrial output for month contracting 16.7 percent. This compares with growth of 4.62 percent in the preceding month of February and 2.08 percent in January.

If that is an indication of the severe impact of a seven-day lockdown, Professsor N.R. Bhanumurthy from the National Institute Public Finance and Policy gives us a sneak peek into the depth of recessionary crisis that lies ahead for the Indian economy

“The current quarter (April-June) and the next two quarters are likely to see negative growth according to studies done by us based on financial modelling. All will depend heavily on the manner in which the macro-economic policies and announcements are implemented. Even with the measures taken through the economic stimulus announced recently, growth will come back only in the fourth quarter of the current financial year (Jan-March 2021),” Bhanumurthy told Sputnik.

Referring to the Modi’s $266 billion economic stimulus package announced on 12 May, Bhanumurthy said even if the benefits of the package are taken into account, the Indian GDP growth will remain zero in the current financial year due to the impact of the package. And, had the Indian government not announced the stimulus, the GDP growth in the financial year 2020-21 would have contracted by at least 12.5 percent.

That said, he also points towards deep recession claiming that even with the stimulus package in place, there is hardly going to be any relief until December.

“We are expecting a 26 percent contraction in growth in the ongoing quarter (April-June) in comparison to the same period last year. And a de-growth of 12.5 per cent each is likely to take place in the both July-September and October-December quarter. However, these assessments may change if government announces further measures in between,” said Bhanumurthy.

It is not that the Indian economy was doing great either before the lockdown. Beginning early 2018 the Indian economy had been slowing down with GDP falling almost every consecutive quarter due to the combined impact its financial sector crisis as well as the US-China trade war. From over 8 percent growth in early 2018, the Indian GDP collapsed by almost half to 4.7 in October – December 2019.

“We expect the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak to weigh on already fragile household consumption which, coupled with sluggish business activity, will result in a sharp decline in India's economic growth in fiscal 2020-21,” said Deborah Tan, a Moody's Assistant Vice President and Analyst.

“Even before the coronavirus outbreak, the economy had already been growing at its slowest pace in six years. Adding the impact from the outbreak, Moody's now expects India's real GDP to contract in the fiscal year ending March 2021 (fiscal 2020-21) compared with an earlier projection of zero growth,” Tan added.

The stimulus announced by Prime Minister Modi weighs heavily on sovereign backed funding arrangements for businesses from banks and financial institutions rather than acting as a direct fiscal stimulus.

A key lawmaker from India’s principal opposition party Congress, P. Chidambaram, a former finance minister, has criticised Modi’s stimulus plan saying that government opted for liquidity measures to boost supply at a time when fiscal measures should have been taken to boost demand to revitalise the economy.

Challenges, however, remain for the economy. And RBI Governor Das’s statement sums those up.

“Domestic economic activity has been impacted severely by the 2 months lockdown. The top 6 industrialised states that account for about 60 percent of industrial output are largely in red or orange zones. High frequency indicators point to a collapse in demand beginning in March 2020 across both urban and rural segments. The biggest blow from COVID-19 has been to private consumption, which accounts for about 60 percent of domestic demand. The production of consumer durables fell by 33 percent in March 2020, accompanied by a 16 percent decline in the output of non-durables.”",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

'Lack of Management' Exacerbating the Problem

""The situation in Brazil becomes more critical every day and the number of contagions and deaths continues to break new records every 24 hours"", says Alan Dantas, a Brazilian journalist and editor of Dossier Sul, an online political magazine. ""The lack of capacity of the central government to work to avoid these numbers is becoming more and more evident. Jair Bolsonaro's government, together with [Brazilian] businessmen, is campaigning for the country to reopen its economic activities and expose people to risk. In many states, health systems have collapsed and in the poorest regions, people remain without health care and die inside their homes"".

The journalist refers to neighbouring Argentina and Venezuela, which have largely managed to get the pandemic under control due to strict quarantine measures and have so far reported 10,649 and 944 confirmed coronavirus cases respectively.

""Brazil lost control of COVID-19 and now the disease already kills more than other health problems"", Dantas opines. ""The big problem is still the lack of management by Jair Bolsonaro's government, which besides not taking care of the disease, makes fun of the death of its citizens"".

From the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak Bolsonaro dismissed it as a ""media trick"" and a ""little flu"" and publicly subjected quarantine restrictions to ridicule. ""We will all die one day"", the president said as quoted by Último Segundo in late March. A month later, he shrugged off news about a spike in coronavirus-related deaths: ""So what? I’m sorry. What do you want me to do?"" he responded to journalists, as cited by The Guardian.

Behind Bolsonaro's calls for opening the country up is a strong lobby from the Brazilian corporate sector, as well as the financial lobby, according to the journalist.

Previously, the president insisted on the necessity to prioritise the economy: ""Are people dying? Oh, yeah. But there will be more people dying, many, many more, if the economy is destroyed by these lockdown measures imposed by governors"", Bolsonaro stated earlier this month, as cited by Euronews.

According to the journalist, Bolsonaro's ""economic crisis"" narrative is aimed at persuading Brazilians that the country's economy will collapse unless its state governors lift the lockdown.

Bolsonaro is on Thin Ice

""The Bolsonaro situation tends to become increasingly unsustainable"", the journalist continues. ""His lack of management in the face of the pandemic and the crisis that Brazil is going through are causing his popularity rates to be lower and lower among the population"".

Bolsonaro's approval rating has fallen to 39.2% from 47.8% in January, according to a CNT/MDA survey, while disapproval of the president has mounted from 47.0% to 55.4%.

The resignations of two health ministers and Justice Minister Sergio Moro's decision to step down in late April ""indicate that Bolsonaro is losing more and more space and has become isolated in the national political scenario"", the journalist suggests.

Moro resigned after Bolsonaro fired Mauricio Valeixo, the federal police chief, in an alleged attempt to shield one of his sons from criminal prosecution. ""I didn’t enter the government to serve a master. I entered it to serve the country, the law"", the former justice minister told Time Magazine, commenting on the matter. The president resolutely denounced the assumptions and even called Moro ""Judas"".

""The [unfolding] scenario triggers many questions about the continuity of [the Bolsonaro] government in the medium term and whether there would already be a propitious scenario for an impeachment process against him, a letter that is already being put on the table"", highlights Alan Dantas. ""It remains to be seen whether Bolsonaro will passively accept this process or risk a coup d'état in the midst of the pandemic"".

On Friday, Brazil's Supreme Court released a video of a cabinet meeting showing Bolsonaro bemoaning his inability to get information from the country's law enforcement officials and vowing to protect his family members. The two-hour video with some portions redacted was made public as part of the ongoing inquiry concerning the president's alleged meddling in a criminal investigation into his son. Although the recent exposure has further escalated tensions in the Brazilian government, Bolsonaro is still strongly denying any wrongdoing.

However, 44% of these cases were diagnosed in the last five days, as many of the new patients were reportedly returning from Colombia.

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused his Colombian counterpart, Iván Duque, of intentionally infecting Venezuelans returning home from Colombia with coronavirus, EFE agency reported, citing the official’s comments during a cabinet meeting in Caracas on Wednesday.

“Two weeks ago, I denounced the order given by Ivan Duque. [There was] a very ill-fated meeting that ordered to do everything that could be done to infect Venezuela,” Maduro said as quoted by EFE.

According to the president, 66 cases of coronavirus out of 75 registered on Wednesday, were “imported” from Colombia, as “informal steps” were taken by “organised gangs” to infect the country’s citizens with COVID-19. Maduro, noting that the situation is still under assessment, suggested that Venezuelans could have been infected on the buses used to transfer them to the border area between two countries, as they were allegedly healthy when leaving Bogota and only in contact with their relatives.

“It is hard [...] but it is harder for them to pollute the country, for them to enter and pollute all of Venezuela, as Iván Duque wishes [...] all these things that I say is because I have the evidence in hand,” the president reportedly said.

According to official estimates, 824 cases of coronavirus have been registered in Venezuela since 13 March, when the first cases of infection were reported in the country. Venezuela rushed to immediately declare a national state of emergency and introduce quarantine measures across the country to prevent the spread of the disease.

Venezuelan authorities say that out of all the registered cases, 44% were reported over the last five days. Maduro specified that all of the newly infected people travelling from Colombia, which has registered 17,687 cases so far, will remain at the land border until they are corona-free.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

While Brazilian President Bolsonaro is pushing state governors to reopen businesses, the Latin American country reported a record 1,179 deaths and 17,408 new coronavirus cases in one day on 19 May. The president's controversial handling of the pandemic has prompted the opposition to step up calls for his impeachment. To date, Brazil’s lower house has received at least 30 impeachment requests, according to Bloomberg. In addition, in late April, Supreme Federal Court authorised an investigation of alleged corruption and obstruction of justice by the president. The decision was made after ex-Brazilian Justice Minister Sergio Moro accused Bolsonaro of firing a top police commander to shield his family from investigations, something that the president vehemently denies.

Bolsonaro's calls for reopening are only hindering Brazil's economic recovery, argues Gustavo Guerreiro, executive editor of the journal World Tensions and a member of the Brazilian Centre for Solidarity with Peoples and Fight for Peace (CEBRAPAZ) envisioning that the Latin American country is heading to a political crisis.

Sputnik: Brazil is among the world's least-tested countries when it comes to COVID-19. While the country has reported nearly 15,000 deaths and 220,000 cases so far, Domingos Alves of the Sao Palo University suggests that the number of infections could be at least 16 times higher. What's your take the unfolding situation? Would you agree that the actual numbers of those infected could be much higher?

Gustavo Guerreiro: The Brazilian government does not know the number of cases of infection spread throughout the country, let alone deaths. But this is a global reality, due to the great speed with which the virus has spread and the inability of the public sector to carry out extensive testing on the population.

This occurs both in Brazil, and in European countries, and even with the US, which may have an even greater number than what we see there. The point is that Brazil is one of the countries where the test for COVID-19 is least tested. There is also a great underreporting of deaths from COVID-19. Many people die with symptoms of the disease, but remain as suspected cases, as they have not been and will not be tested. I have no doubt that the reality must be even more serious than the study's estimate.

I do not doubt that Brazil will soon take second place, along with the US, with the highest number of cases and deaths from the disease. Interestingly, the two countries are governed by presidents who have scorned the severity of the disease. Bolsonaro manages to be even worse, because not only does he disregard isolation, but he stimulates agglomerations. This is not an ideological conviction motivated by the so-called herd immunisation, which in itself is absurd, but a sordid rejoicing in a policy of eugenics.

Sputnik: Has the Brazilian government so far developed any plan of how to handle the pandemic? What's your take on Bolsonaro's decision to open-up while the death toll is rising? What's behind this? Is he seeking to ""emulate"" Donald Trump?

Gustavo Guerreiro: There is no structural plan to deal with the pandemic. In Brazil, there is no figure of the central government, which coordinates integrated actions with the federal entities, as it should be.

The proposal to open up trade and economic activity is absurd. You cannot oppose life to the economy. Bolsonaro insists on blaming the governors and the idea of ​​confinement for the economic recession. The cause of the recession is the pandemic. Mass confinement, however paradoxical it may seem, is also a form of faster economic recovery. The less time a country spends facing the pandemic, the better for a return to productive activities. Stimulating the return to work in the middle of a pandemic means, in addition to the human tragedy, as the health system would not support it, an economic tragedy.

This behavior occurs because the president is committed to the elites' agenda. Much of the business community cares little that the working class is dying. Since labor and social security reform removed workers' rights and much of social protection, and since Labor Justice was reformed after the political coup against Dilma Rousseff, the worker became disposable.

Bolsonaro himself said that the death of a company was much mores serious than the death of an individual. Added to all this is the desire to imitate everything that occurs in the Trump administration, to whom Bolsonaro's government is unilaterally aligned, like a vassal.

Sputnik: Less than a month after Jair Bolsonaro sacked ex-Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta the country's new health minister stepped down. What's the reason behind Dr. Nelson Teich's resignation?

Gustavo Guerreiro: Bolsonaro is often concerned about the prominence of the Ministry of Health, which at a moment of such gravity is robbing the president of his central role.

The departure of Health Minister Nelson Teich before completing a month in office is just one of the president's inconsequential acts, which has the support of the military around him. Teich did not resign as ""a life choice"", as he said, but due to an irrational clash over social isolation and protocols for using hydroxychloroquine. The president had determined that the drug can be used preventively and for mild symptoms. The minister, who is also a doctor, refused to put lives at risk, so he left.

The drug became an obsession for Bolsonaro, who uses it as a political argument to counter the social isolation actions taken by state governors. Bolsonaro ordered the Army Pharmaceutical Chemical Laboratory to produce medicine on a large scale (about 1.25 million pills) with raw material purchased from India. Bolsonaro took the hasty step without discussion with the Ministry of Health itself and with doctors and scientists, but the medication has not been used.

As hydroxychloroquine has its effectiveness questioned all over the world, as well as by the Brazilian Sanitary Surveillance Agency, Bolsonaro does not know what to do with all medication produced by the military, which constitutes an act of administrative impropriety and a crime of fiscal responsibility. To try to protect himself from the results of the deaths resulting from this folly, Bolsonaro issued Provisional Measure 966, which aims to exempt government officials from responsibility for the misuse of public resources and errors in performance during the pandemic.

Sputnik: Earlier Bolsonaro's Justice Minister Sérgio Moro withdrew from the government. Are these resignations a sign of a looming political crisis for the Bolsonaro's cabinet, in your opinion? What's your prognosis on how the political situation will unfold?

Gustavo Guerreiro: Sérgio Moro was the main supporter of his government. As a judge, Moro defrauded the criminal process that culminated in the illegal imprisonment of former President Lula, guaranteeing the election of Bolsonaro, who would lose to the then former president. As Bolsonaro has not joined any political party and is seeing his political support base crumble, he begins to cede positions to corrupt political forces, the so-called “centrão” (center parties). At the same time, he sees investigations against his family moving forward.

Former allies, such as Sérgio Moro himself and businessman Paulo Marinho have begun to expose the insides of the Bolsonaro family's corruption schemes. The National Congress is beginning to move towards an impeachment. In the bubbling political melting pot that Brazil has become, especially in the midst of a health crisis and an unprecedented economic crisis, there is no way to make accurate predictions. Anything can happen. Even a military coup can be considered. Brazil is going through one of its worst moments in republican history and it does not seem that things will improve.

Venezuela’s central bank has filed a legal claim in a commercial court in an effort to force the Bank of England to transfer £930mln ($1.13bln) of its gold, kept there, to fund the government’s COVID-19 response, reported Reuters citing a document submitted in a London court.

Dated 14 May, the claim reportedly says the Venezuelan central bank “seeks an order requiring the BoE to comply with the proposed instruction”.

Venezuela, which has been under coronavirus quarantine since March, hopes the gold's value will be transferred to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to subsequently be used for purchasing healthcare supplies, medicine, and food, says the outlet.

Venezuela so far has registered 749 coronavirus cases according to the Johns Hopkins University, with 10 deaths from the respiratory disease.

The government of Nicolas Maduro has been seeking to sell off some of the country’s gold reserves as a means of raising funds amid the current healthcare crisis and quarantine measures it has entailed.

The situation has been compounded by plummeting global oil prices and crippling US sanctions.

“The foot-dragging by the Bank of England is critically hampering Venezuela and the UN’s efforts to combat COVID-19 in the country,” Sarosh Zaiwalla, a London-based lawyer representing the central bank, was quoted by Reuters as saying.

There has not been any official response regarding the claim from either the Bank of England or the Venezuelan central bank.

The reported legal claim comes after a request made by Nicolas Maduro’s government in April to the Bank of England - which acts as a gold custodian for several developing nations - to sell off some of its gold reserves there and direct the funds to the UN so they might be used to aid Venezuela’s efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.

The legal wrangling and has been dragging on for some time, as the Bank of England has refused to transfer some 31 tonnes of Venezuelan gold to the government of Nicolas Maduro, whom the UK has refused to recognise as the country’s legitimate leader since 2018, reports the outlet.

So much of the media has been focused on the coronavirus pandemic in the country’s urban hotspots. We hear a lot of news about the outbreaks in New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and elsewhere. But we don’t hear much about what is happening in rural America. How is the pandemic hitting rural counties across the country?

President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in recent days have repeated false information that the coronavirus was created in a Chinese lab in Wuhan. The two have said repeatedly that they have “enormous evidence” and “a significant amount of evidence” that this is the case. But the statements are not true. Pompeo, in an interview with Breitbart yesterday, backed off and said he doesn’t know where the virus originated. But Trump has doubled down, saying falsely that the US had given the lab $7.5 million as part of a 5-year grant and that he “ended it.” KJ Noh, a peace activist and scholar on the geopolitics of Asia, and he’s a frequent contributor to Counterpunch and Dissident Voice, joins Brian.

Last week, Senator Richard Burr, a Republican of North Carolina, stepped aside from his role as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee because he was being investigated by the FBI for insider trading. Yesterday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell named Florida Republican Marco Rubio as the acting chairman of that committee. Rubio, a former presidential candidate is a well-known conservative and war hawk who has advocated the use of US military force around the world, including against Cuba, Venezuela, Iran, and other countries. John speaks with Ben Norton, a journalist with The Grayzone and co-host of the Moderate Rebels podcast.

Wednesday’s weekly series, In the News, is where the hosts look at the most important ongoing developments of the week and put them into perspective. Sputnik news analysts Nicole Roussell and Walter Smolarek join Brian and John.

Wednesday’s regular segment, Beyond Nuclear, is about nuclear issues, including weapons, energy, waste, and the future of nuclear technology in the United States. Kevin Kamps, the Radioactive Waste Watchdog at the organization Beyond Nuclear, and Sputnik news analyst and producer Nicole Roussell, join Brian on the show.

In this episode of By Any Means Necessary hosts Sean Blackmon and Jacquie Luqman are joined by Ajamu Baraka, National Organizer for the Black Alliance for Peace, to talk about the news that all 50 states are reopening as the country passes 90,000 coronavirus deaths, the renewed waves of racist violence and harassment throughout the country, and his new article in Black Agenda Report, ""Neoliberalism, Intervention and Anti-Blackness.""

In the second segment, Sean and Jacquie are joined by Dr. Seyed Mohammad Marandi, Professor of English Literature and Orientalism at the University of Tehran, to discuss Iran's warning to the United States not to interfere with their oil assistance to Venezuela, new US sanctions on a Chinese firm doing business with an Iranian airliner, and the themes of criminality and cruelty surrounding the ongoing economic warfare that comprises much of US foreign policy.

In the third segment, Sean and Jacquie are joined by Patricio Zamorano, academic, international media analyst, and co-Director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs (COHA.org), to talk about the wave of renewed protests by hungry workers in Chile, the parallels between Chile's handling of the crisis and those of other right-wing Latin American governments, and the rush by corporate media to demonize governments like Mexico and Nicaragua.

Later in the show, Sean and Jacquie are joined by Dr. Edward Onaci, Associate Professor of History and African American & Africana Studies at Ursinus College and author of the new book, ""Free the Land: The Republic of New Afrika and the Pursuit of a Black Nation-State,"" to talk about the new attempts by the Trump administration to crack down on mail-in voting, the news that commissioners in Franklin County, Ohio have declared racism a public health crisis, and how to incorporate theory and practice in a new and unpredictable world.

""President Donald Trump on Monday sent a four-page letter to Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, threatening to permanently freeze US funding to the United Nations agency in the midst of a global pandemic that has made international cooperation as crucial as ever,"" Common Dreams reported Tuesday. This comes as ""Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday pledged $2 billion to the WHO to tackle the coronavirus pandemic and said he supported a 'global review' of the international response to the outbreak, but only if it is led by the WHO and only after the virus has been contained,"" Fox News reported Monday. What are we to make of this?

As Trump continues the removal of various inspectors general, ""the firing of State Department IG Steve Linick might be the most problematic,"" the Washington Post's Aaron Blake wrote in a Tuesday analysis. ""Linick, we've come to find out, had been investigating Secretary of State Mike Pompeo personally, as well as a major decision Pompeo had approved on an arms deal with Saudi Arabia. Both the White House and Pompeo have said the removal of Linick was Pompeo’s call."" Why is this problematic?

""US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has threatened that Washington will 'exact consequences' if the International Criminal Court (ICC) moves ahead with a potential war crimes investigation into Israel,"" PressTV reported Sunday. In response to this, ""a bipartisan group of US House and Senate legislators sent separate letters to Pompeo urging him to defend Israel, a firm US ally, against ICC investigations, saying the tribunal's assertion amounted to a 'politicization' of the court's mission,"" PressTV continued.

While countries with better health infrastructure accounted for over 90 percent of reported deaths from COVID-19 alongside a mortality rate as high as 15 percent of those infected, in contrast, the densely populated sub-Asian nation of India has a mortality rate of 3.2 percent. Experts have been attempting to explain the reason for this comparatively low rate. Some suggest demographics, varying immune systems and the pile-up of cases in big cities as the cause of the low death rate.

Various factors could be responsible for the comparatively low number of deaths in the country. India’s young population could be acting as a shield against the coronavirus, according to some, combined with a purported immunity that resists the disease, Dr. Arvind Kumar, a chest surgeon in New Delhi who previously received the highest award for medical practitioners in India, told Sputnik.

Nations with a high load of coronavirus cases, including the US, with a high fatality ratio – the percentage of deaths among confirmed COVID-19 cases – at 6 percent, while European countries accounted for an even higher death rate. The UK reported fatality rate is thought to be 14.4 percent, France at 15.2 percent and Italy 14 percent, per data presented by by the Johns Hopkins University.

""In terms of case mortality per 100000 population, India has so far about 0.2 deaths per hundred thousand population vis-a-vis approx. 4.1 deaths per 10000 population for the world as a whole,"" the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said on 20 May, adding, “Aggressive and early measures have shown encouraging results”.

Young Population of India

Indian census data suggests that half of the nation's population is under 25, almost 600 million people. The country has a median age of 28 in 2019, while the US and UK stand at 38 and 40, respectively.

The fact that 80 percent of people affected by the virus India are under 60 has played in favour of the country says Kumar, citing that India’s constantly improving recovery rate is now 40 percent.

“In the US and Europe, it is the old people who have been dying and old people constitute a large percentage of their population. Whereas in India, people above 70 constitute a small percentage of our population. And even in our setup, if you look at these 3000 people who have died, at least 60-70 percent of them are those who are above 60 and having diseases.”

According to Health Ministry data, a small section of people, 17 percent of COVID-19 patients in the country, are above 60 and that age group accounts for 60 percent of deaths in India.

Body Immunity

The exposure of people to harsh environmental conditions, including comprised water and air and other kinds of pollution from a young age has helped in some way to gain additional immunity against infection, claims Kumar.

“The extreme environmental factors have remained an integral part of the Indian population, therefore, the body becomes immune to regular infections as our immune system automatically starts building the antibodies to act against the enemy,” said Kumar, also the chairman of Center of Chest Surgery.

Indians have natural immunity, compared to those from western countries, which could play a role against the coronavirus, offers the doctor, adding that these assertions are mere conjecture and suggesting that several societal elements are simultaneously contributing in small proportions.

Less Stress on Health Infrastructure

Earlier, India quickly ramped up health facilities, gaining crucial time by imposing lockdowns at an early stage on 24 March with just 500 cases recorded. With only 0.55 beds per 1000 population in government hospitals, the country built COVID-19 dedicated hospitals and converted old train carriages into isolation wards.

“The health facilities in India are still not flooded the way it happened in Europe and USA, they were caught off guard and soon their ICU were overwhelmed with patients. Whereas India used the lockdown period aggressively, we have made preparations so that even if now the cases are increasing, the health facilities are here to take care,” said Kumar.

He added that there were instances when ventilators were not available to patients in France. “Fortunately that situation has not arisen in India, and it's unlikely to arise with the present state of preparedness,” he added.

Accumulation of Cases in Metro Cities

The more vulnerable Indian states, with more fragile healthcare systems, are still not bearing the brunt of the coronavirus cases in the country, as most cases have been recorded in states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Gujarat, said the doctor.

“The good thing is that 50 percent of our cases are actually confined to three states: Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. They constitute nearly 50 percent of the volume of the cases. And the most vulnerable states like Bihar, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh still have the least amount of cases,” added Kumar.

The worst-affected India state is Maharashtra, which accounts for 39,297 COVID-19 positive cases and 1390 deaths, out of an estimated 3400 deaths in the country. Similarly, Tamil Nadu has 13,191 infections, Gujarat 12,537 and Delhi 11,088.

The 'Grim' Future

These dynamics can quickly change due to reverse migration, warns the doctor. The more people who become unemployed and are forced to return to their hometowns and taking less protective measures, the more cases could arise in India’s more remote locations.

Kumar suggested that infections in India could increase to 4,000,000-5,00,000 with relaxed social norms in several states by the time the country hits the peak in June-July. ""It's only by July end that India will see a decline in number of infections, till then a temporary spurt is expected,"" he offered.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

Between 4.6 to 5.5 million people could be hospitalised under this scenario, severely straining limited health resources.

Nearly 250 million people could catch the novel coronavirus (COVID-19 aka SARS-CoV-2) across the African continent, with up to 190,000 of them dying if African countries don’t receive the support that they require. This is according to the latest peer-reviewed report by experts from the World Health Organization (WHO), due to be published soon in the British Medical Journal.

Dr Humphrey Karamagi is the Team Leader for Data, Analytics and Knowledge Management in the WHO Regional Office for Africa and co-authored this latest report.

Sputnik: How will non-African countries be affected if the African continent doesn't get the support it requires to avoid the worst-case scenario that your model predicts?

Dr Humphrey Karamagi: All countries of the world will be affected negatively. At present, WHO has said it anticipates the virus would be around the globe for a few years.

Africa may become a source of new infections for other regions of the world, just as other regions may be a source of new infections for Africa. The support to the African countries therefore needs to be part of the overall global response for all countries.

Sputnik: Your report says that previous predictive models have failed to adequately reflect the socio-ecological factors which are unique to many African countries.

What is different about your model that results in a more fair and accurate prediction of what we can expect to occur in Africa?

Dr Humphrey Karamagi: First, it takes into consideration new information about the epidemiology of SARS-Cov_2 infection, which the other models may not have had.

Second, it incorporates the information on how the infection interacts in the body to cause severe disease, particularly in relation to the elderly, and people with obesity, diabetes or are on hypertension management.

Third, it captures a wider range of socio-ecological factors influencing transmission, all of which country specific data is used to build country-specific models of transmission.

Sputnik: What must be done to avoid the worst-case scenarios of healthcare systems being overstretched due to the COVID-19 outbreak?

Dr Humphrey Karamagi: Effective public health measures focusing on the need to test, isolate, treat and quarantine suspected cases. The aim is to interrupt transmission enough to reduce the risk of infection to a level where a country can effectively respond to the cases its health system can manage. This will avoid unnecessary deaths and costs.

Sputnik: The African continent appears to have suffered less from COVID-19 compared to Europe, the US and parts of Latin America thus far.

Why is that? Could it be that a lack of sufficient testing is hiding the true figures of those who have contracted the virus?

Dr Humphrey Karamagi: There are a number of potential explanations:

First, it could be that Africa is still at the early phase of the pandemic that Europe and America went through given its lower rate of transmission postulated from the model. Cases are now increasing in countries where public health containment measures are not effective and reducing in countries where they are (like Mauritius, Eritrea).

Secondly, levels of testing are very low in some countries and many cases may not be detected. As seen in the rest of the world, it is important to have expansive testing in order to identify and respond to cases.

Sputnik: Is your model open source and can its assumptions and data can be scrutinised and evaluated?

Dr Humphrey Karamagi: Obviously it is, and has even been peer reviewed by independent experts. All countries have received and are using it through the WHO Country Offices.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

He also warns that ""simply pumping trillions"" into the financial system won't deliver a recovery on its own.

According to the International Monetary Fund, even prior to the current global recession, the real GDP growth rate per capita had been subdued or declining, public investment had been declining and the growth of investment per capita in emerging markets had also been slow.

Michael Roberts has worked as an economist with investment research firms in the City of London for over 30 years. He explains that the COVID-19 lockdowns represented the ""tipping point"" for a global economy which was already headed towards recession.

Sputnik: Jay Powell, Chair of the US Federal Reserve Bank, recently said that the current economic crisis is completely due to COVID-19 and the lockdown policies and not due to any underlying problems in the economy.

How would you respond to Powell's remarks?

Michael Roberts: Just as they did during the global financial crash in 2008-9, the monetary authorities do not want to admit that the current crisis has its origins in fault lines in the major economies. Only last September [2019], the fed was forced to inject billions in emergency liquidity when credit markets crunched. That credit squeeze reflected a significant slowdown in global growth, including [in] the US.

Most countries experienced their lowest real GDP growth rates in 2019 since the end of the great recession in 2009. Indeed, business investment was falling in most major economies; Japan and parts of Europe were already in a recession or close to it; while several large emerging economies like Mexico, Turkey, Argentina and others were in a slump. So the world economy was weakening and in no shape to handle the pandemic.

The pandemic was the tipping point.

Sputnik: Data from the International Monetary Fund and the Penn World Tables suggest that the US and other major economies were headed towards recession even before the COVID-19 lockdown.

Michael Roberts: Yes, IMF real GDP growth figures for 2019 were at their lowest in ten years. Global trade was falling and the manufacturing sectors of many major economies were contracting. Moreover corporate profits, the life blood of corporate investment, had stopped rising in the major economies, with profitability globally at lows.

Michael Roberts Global corporate profits (weighted mean) % year on year

Sputnik: Can you explain, to a lay-person, the evidence that supports this position and whether you agree with it?

Michael Roberts: In my view, business investment is the key to incomes and employment. And business investment ultimately depends on the profitability of that investment. If profitability is low and even falling, investment will suffer and that situation had already emerged in 2019 before the virus struck.

Michael Roberts Advanced economies investment and savings ratios (% of GDP)

Sputnik: Why should it matter whether or not the US and the global economy were headed towards a recession before ""The Great Lockdown""?

Michael Roberts: The reason it matters is that because the world economy was already showing signs of significant weakness and close to recession in GDP, trade and investment, then it will take much longer to come out of the pandemic slump than otherwise. Many companies (even large ones) may not return once the lockdowns are over and 'normal' business resumes.

Jobs and incomes will be permanently lost. This phenomenon is called in economics, hysteresis, where short-term damage morphs into long-term loss. That is the likely prospect now - something that Fed chair Powell admitted in his recent speech.

Sputnik: Where do you think we are headed if current government policies don't change and why?

Michael Roberts: There is optimistic talk of a V-shaped recovery, i.e. a quick return to previous GDP and investment growth ([which was] already weakening as I have argued). But that assumes lockdowns end quickly, there is no long-term damage, that there is no 'second wave' in the virus and a vaccine is found soon.

More likely, economies will have a U-shaped or even l-shaped recovery because pumping trillions of credit money into the financial system will not deliver recovery if profitability in the productive sectors remains low. What is needed is a massive government investment programme as adopted during WW2 in civilian and green projects to restore growth and employment. A 'Marshall Plan' for the pandemic.

Sputnik: How are everyday people affected by the current crisis?

Michael Roberts: Several studies show that workers earning the lowest pay and in so-called low-skill (but necessary) jobs are taking the biggest hit. Professional workers are able to work from home and have not seen much income loss. Others who must go to work are taking the biggest losses and also face the prospect of having no job to go back to or only after wages and hours cuts.

But newly obtained government documents by a UK-based investigative journalist reveal a much deeper relationship with members of the coup-government-in-waiting.

John McEvoy is an independent journalist who has published in the International History Review, The Canary, Tribune Magazine, Jacobin, Declassified UK, Brasil Wire among other publications. He reported from Venezuela during the coup efforts in 2019, from Colombia during the student protests the same year and from France in 2020 on the Yellow Vests movement and general strike.

Mr McEvoy's main research focus is in contemporary British involvement in Latin America - notably British state intervention and natural resource extraction in Colombia since 1989. He speaks English, Spanish and French.

Sputnik: You recently published an exposé revealing the existence of a secret unit working within the UK Foreign Office that was liaising with elements of the Venezuelan opposition.

What exactly did you discover?

John McEvoy: I discovered a Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) Unit named the Venezuela Reconstruction Unit, which hadn't previously been acknowledged by either the government, the diplomat involved, nor the Venezuelan opposition, with whom the unit has collaborated.

It was also found that Juan Guaidó's representative in the UK, Vanessa Neumann, had spoke with FCO officials about the sustenance of British business interests in Venezuela's 'reconstruction'. Given Venezuela sits on the largest proven oil reserves in the world, and Neumann's past links with oil corporations, we can only imagine what this means.

Sputnik: Who are the key players in this unit?

John McEvoy: The only diplomat that we know is involved thus far is John Saville, the former UK ambassador to Venezuela between 2014 and 2017. He's been a diplomat for some decades.

Sputnik: Why is this significant, why should this matter to anyone living in Britain?

John McEvoy: It's obviously important for UK citizens to know what is being done in their name - be it at home or abroad. In the case of Venezuela, which is undergoing a serious political and economic crisis, it's important that UK citizens know how the UK government is contributing to this - through sanctions, partnering with the US in trying to destabilise the country, and in planning for the country's 'reconstruction' following an imagined coup.

When you look at the past record of British destabilisation and 'reconstruction' - in Iraq, Libya, Syria, or Afghanistan, for instance - you get the kind of idea of what might await Venezuela should the government be overthrown. But it's not just about a utilitarian approach, it's also about confronting imperialism. What right does the UK government have in the 'reconstruction' of another sovereign nation?

I'm sure the British population would be alarmed if it were to learn that Venezuela had a specialist unit within its Ministry of External Affairs planning for the 'reconstruction' of Britain.

Sputnik: Did the Foreign Office have an explanation for the existence of this unit?

John McEvoy: The FCO responded in a way that has characterised British public diplomacy over recent years: that they're trying to 'help' Venezuelans resolve their 'appalling political and economic crisis'. Even the smallest understanding of British foreign policy, and the history of British interventions abroad, would lead one to immediately suspect this explanation. That's before considering the numerous different ways in which the British government has joined in with the economic strangulation of Venezuela over the past 16 months - notably in freezing over $1bn worth of Venezuelan gold held in the Bank of England.

These sanctions are even more concerning in light of the current coronavirus - Venezuela is struggling to import vital medication for years. What's more, if the Venezuela Reconstruction Unit is so committed to benign objectives such as democracy promotion and political assistance, it's quite a wonder why they kept silent about it since Autumn 2019.

Sputnik: How would you respond to someone who says that it isn't that big a deal for the UK Foreign Office to have a group of people whose job is to liaise with opposition figures in another country?

John McEvoy: Of course it's within the FCO's remit to liaise with foreign politicians and diplomats. In this case, those with whom it is liaising have been trying to violently overthrow their elected government for the past 16 months (and, in the wider context, since Hugo Chavez was first elected in 1998). The most recent instance came to a head this month when US and Venezuelan mercenaries arrived on the Venezuelan coasts with plans to kidnap the president and gun down ""violent colectivos"" - which is frequently a code-word for working class, usually socialist communities in Venezuela who support the legitimacy and sovereignty of their government and state.

In March and April 2019, I stayed with the leader of a colectivo in Caracas, Venezuela, for two weeks. This colectivo was dedicated to helping the local children with cultural events and activities - dance, theatre, art, etc. Yet in the international media, colectivos have been comprehensively painted as violent, thuggish supporters of the Venezuelan government. Painting them as 'thugs' or 'terrorists' provides a pre-emptive justification for attacking supporters of the government and those who defend the sovereignty of the Venezuelan state.

What this [recent mercenary] plan entailed was a possible massacre of the Venezuelans who would inevitably come out in defence of the sovereignty of their state. The contract for this operation reportedly bears Juan Guaidó's signature and he is named as the operation's Commander in Chief - and these plans were underway when Guaidó visited the UK in January 2020. This is, therefore, a unique situation - the UK government is collaborating, at the highest levels, with political forces that are involved in what many would describe as terrorism.

Sputnik: Is there anything about their activities that you still don't know that you want to know?

John McEvoy: Yes - another Freedom of Information request has been sent; hopefully there'll be a follow-up article on this latest piece.

Evolutionary Epidemiologist Dr Rob Wallace authored Big Farms Make Big Flu: Dispatches on Infectious Disease, Agribusiness, and the Nature of Science in 2016, which predicted an escalation in global pandemics like those caused by Swine Flu, SARS and MERS. His work involves analysing the historical and geographical basis for the origin and spread of viruses.

Dr Wallace received his Ph.D. in biology at the CUNY Graduate Center, and did post-doctorate work at the University of California, Irvine, with Walter Fitch, a founder of molecular phylogeny. He is a Visiting Scholar at the Institute for Global Studies, University of Minnesota and has consulted with the Food and Agriculture Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Sputnik: What exactly is an evolutionary epidemiologist, and what is it that you specialise in?

Dr Rob Wallace: We all know that infectious diseases spread, but as they spread they also evolve. An evolutionary epidemiologist uses methods and concepts in population biology to describe how pathogens evolve in the course of diffusing across a landscape.

I specialise on applying principles in economic geography to explain how major threats such as avian and swine influenza, Ebola, Zika, and SARS-CoV-2 spread and evolve in response to the world as it presently is -- largely structured around circuits of capital and production.

Sputnik: Explain the main thesis of your book Big Farms Make Big Flu. How much of your work has predicted the emergence of something like the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?

Dr Rob Wallace: It was only upon touring for my book back in 2017 that I thought through the best encapsulation of its thesis: As we industrialise the production of food, we also industrialise the pathogens that circulate among our livestock and crops. This mode of food production, producing, in livestock, cities of monoculture hog and chickens and other livestock and poultry around the world, is selecting for pathogens that are deadlier, more infectious, and of a wider diversity.

Now, that description accounts for pathogens that have made their way to the intensive farms within the spatial orbits of many a city. At the other end of regional production circuits, pathogens oft-spill directly from increasingly encroached-upon forests and the wild animals there, the reservoirs of exotic pathogens to which few humans have been exposed.

When we log, mine, or replace primary forest with plantation agriculture, we simplify the forest in such a way that deadly pathogens previously bottled up in wildlife are able to spring free.

Sputnik: You've co-authored an article arguing that the ""failure to prepare for and react"" to the COVID-19 outbreak have been decades in the making. Can you explain what you mean by this?

Dr Rob Wallace: Pandemics are mirrors. They tell a society its status. Over the past forty years, public health in the U.S., for instance, has been both neglected and monetised to the point that what was a social commons is largely individualised at the point of contact with insurance companies that may, or may not, pay for a treatment.

A pandemic pathogen doesn't subscribe to that model of intervention. Indeed, as we already see, COVID-19 is affecting the poorest and most oppressed to the point that it overloads health systems so that the health needs of everyone else other than the very richest are affected as well. For systems so interested in privatising every part of society, the most basic truisms of human community, such as the health of everyone is interconnected, are appearing such a shock.

The U.S.'s ruling class cannot recognise itself in the pandemic save in passing off the worst damage upon the 99%.

Sputnik: To what extent has the preparation for a global pandemic and handling of the current crisis been lacking?

Dr Rob Wallace: Upon bird flu H5N1 in 1997 and again in 2003, the various U.N. health agencies --WHO, [Food and Agriculture Organization], [International Organisation of Employers] -- put their territorialism aside and began to work together through how the health of wildlife, livestock, and humans are interconnected. So both the scientific community and many a health officer placed the possibility of a pandemic front and centre.

But governments worldwide treated every subsequent outbreak as some new and unconnected shock: SARS-1, H1N1 (2009), MERS, Ebola in West Africa and the Congo, Zika, and so on. Each outbreak was treated as an emergency at the expense of discussing and responding to the structural causes shared across the series of outbreaks.

There are many such causes, but the big one is treated as much a part of our world as gravity or the sun. Centres of capital the world over are funding deforestation and development on forest frontiers across the world, expanding the interface between animal disease reservoirs and newly placed livestock and the labour tending them.

An increasing diversity of pathogens are now spilling over and they have much clearer shot migrating out of the deepest forests to local regional capitals with easy access to the global travel network. But none of the public health staff are empowered to talk about or act upon the ""c-word"" driving these outbreaks. It is the unspeakable prime directive at the heart of global political economy. And so scientists are stuck with the impossible task of merely cleaning up after the epidemiological messes of the very system producing these outbreaks.

Sputnik: What, in your opinion, needs to be done in order to ensure the likelihood of future outbreaks is reduced as well as sufficiently mitigating against them when they do occur?

Dr Rob Wallace: Responding with proper programs in public health, including the right supply of hospital capacity and PPE [Personal Protection Equipment] and antivirals and employment insurance, are all necessary. Seems trite, but many of the richest industrial countries have flat-out failed in such basics. A lack of resources wasn't the problem. The political class's refusal to pay for them under the most Malthusian of justifications is the revulsion to blame.

Bigger picture, but not unrelated, we must also change our very way of social reproduction or how we reproduce our societies generation to generation. We must reintegrate humanity into the ecologies we share with other creatures in such a way that we accept, and respond to, the consequences of appropriating the resources we need to survive as a species. We must end expropriating land and labour to the point that capital can get away with externalising the worst costs of production -- climate change, pollution, labour morbidity, land grabs, declines in nutrition, and pandemics, among many other damage--onto everyone else. That selects for the utterly worst behaviours possible.

It's a sociopathic way of living that requires radical recalibration. Otherwise, given the scale of our present civilisation, we threaten to end society as we know it the world over. That might involve both the bang of a pandemic that kills a billion people and the whimper of drawn-out pulses in shifts in climate. We deserve better. We can use our brilliant collective minds and our everyday-apparent compassion to readjust our shared community to another mode of living entirely. Even in the face of what seem such terrible odds. We have no choice otherwise.

The economy is unlikely to fully recover until the end of 2021, the EC report says. According to European Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni, “Europe is experiencing an economic shock without precedent since the Great Depression.” The European Commissioner said that the scale of the economic downturn and the speed of economic recovery would vary for different EU regions and would depend on how quickly a country would lift quarantine measures, how much a country depends on tourism as well as on the general state of its economy. “These differences pose a threat to the single market and the Eurozone,” the official said. What’s your take on this?

Rumen Gechev: At this stage, the EC estimates seem quite objective, provided that in the next two to three months the main restrictions caused by COVID-19 will be lifted. GDP will fall by at least 10-12% as a result of a serious decline in investment and consumption, severely hampered exports in the EU – and especially outside the EU – as well as rapidly growing unemployment and a chain of bankruptcy cases. Of course, the scale of the crisis will vary depending on the structure of individual national economies and their external logistics chains. The EC and the ECB, which have learned from the mistake of pursuing austerity policies during the previous crisis of 2007-2009, have now taken the right path providing companies and households with large-scale liquidity by issuing interest-free loans, credit guarantees and easing loan guarantee requirements, gratuitous assistance, as well by issuing direct and indirect subsidies. The EC announced that it was temporarily abandoning the restrictions imposed on budget deficit size and the share of government debt on GDP. The green light was also given to provide state assistance to private companies.

However, such relaxation can have a very high price. The Eurozone has somewhat “slowed down;” it had faced serious economic and financial problems even before the crisis started. Despite banking control tightening, many Eurozone banks have ended up in turbulent conditions. For example, Deutsche Bank has suffered huge losses for several years, while it directly or indirectly controls more than $2 trillion worth of assets in Germany, the EU, the US and other countries.

The bankruptcy of tens of thousands of firms and the increase in unemployment means that a critically large number of legal entities and individuals won’t be able to service their loans. This time, unlike the previous crisis, governments won’t be able to allocate budgetary funds to help banks that find themselves in a difficult situation. Firstly, because budget expenditures have already increased significantly, and secondly, because taxpayers won’t agree to again help banks with their own money. The situation is worsening because even before the crisis, countries didn’t agree on a new EU budget for 2020 due to increased internal disagreements after Brexit. It turned out that Germany and France, especially Germany, didn’t want to increase their contribution to the EU budget. After that, it became clear that expectations regarding some kind of general fiscal policy, including creating a Eurozone finance ministry, were unrealistic. Plans to issue debt securities are unlikely to be realized because, at this stage, Germany and the Netherlands categorically refuse to allocate their national budget resources for that. Thus, a common fight against COVID-19 is impossible without the overall financing of anti-crisis measures. And it is precisely this lack of solidarity that poses the greatest danger to the Eurozone. This is an extremely big risk, even in the medium term. If this risk is not minimized, if it is not possible to reach solutions acceptable to everyone, another serious Eurozone crisis could lead to the collapse of the European Union.

Sputnik: Which European countries do you think will suffer the most, and who will most easily get through the post-coronavirus economic depression? Is out of sync recovery really a threat to the EU single market? What should be done? Is it urgently “pouring” additional EU funds into the economies of the countries that would suffer most, or is there any other option?

Rumen Gechev: The real results of the crisis will become clear at least in a few months. The countries that are likely to suffer the most are states with the highest share of tourism in their GDP – Italy, Spain, France, Greece, Bulgaria, etc., as well as countries with hub airports, and therefore with large passenger flows.

In the long run, this crisis cannot be resolved only through money injections. At the moment, this is exactly what EU governments are doing, of course, with some slight differences in volume and tools.

The EU’s foreign economic relations, production organization and sustainability amid such an external shock should be comprehensively reevaluated; this especially concerns key industries that ensure regional and national security. Some production facilities are most likely to be withdrawn from China, or substitute capacities will be created in the EU. This is a chance for countries such as Bulgaria: countries that may be suitable for such a relocation of production capacity. This is probably a chance for real progress towards convergence between less and more developed European economies, which has been proclaimed for many years. Without reducing technological and socio-economic differences, it is impossible to overcome the dangerous stagnation in integration processes.

Talking to Russian RBC, Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said:

“Today, they often say that there is no leader in global politics and several countries claim this role. This situation creates new opportunities for the European Union, given its reputation as a player capable of offering constructive solutions to problems, acting in different directions and in the most difficult situations.”

Sputnik: Considering difficult Sino-American relations, can the EU in the post-COVID era become the new global leader, or is it just flaunting amid the difficult situation with the coronavirus, where the EU started responding quite late, which has in due time caused discontent in Italy, for example?

Rumen Gechev: Unfortunately, the EU won’t be able to take the opportunity of being a global leader. If Germany is excluded, other leading countries (France, Italy, Spain) remain captive to fiscal deficits, debts, and worsening social and domestic political problems. Italy’s banking and fiscal system was already on the razor’s edge, and now it needs to solve the terrifying problems cause by the coronavirus. France is also facing a serious challenge. Every government’s attempt to reform pensions, for example, faces mass protests of “Yellow Vests” on Champs Elysees. And as soon as quarantine restrictions are lifted, protests are likely to continue. Yes, the EU is a significant economic centre in the global economy, but its weight in international politics doesn’t correspond to economic opportunities. For example, the prospects of creating a common EU army are far-fetched; and without its own army, the EU will continue to depend on NATO.

Sputnik: In 2019, Bulgaria rated first in terms of military spending growth, due to its purchase of American F-16s. At the same time, according to Eurostat, Bulgaria has the lowest minimum wage in the EU (€312). According to a study by the 24 Chasa newspaper, Bulgarian pensions are among the lowest not only in the EU, but also in the Balkans. Why do you think the government decided to purchase the aircraft, the price of which greatly exceeded the original maximum? Both President Rumen Radev and many MPS pointed to the fact that the deal implied reduced opportunities, but Valentin Radev from the ruling GERB Party noted that that purchase brought Bulgaria closer to NATO, its strategic partner, where the United States is “the front man.” Do you think the choice is due primarily to this, or is Sofia really facing serious security challenges?

Rumen Gechev: Bulgaria is a NATO member, and it should fulfil its obligations under the treaty. But it should be clarified that this should be mutually beneficial; as for the F-16 case, there are several serious problems. Firstly, according to experts, this model has exhausted its capabilities, even in the new Block 70 modification. Therefore, the Pentagon hasn’t bought this aircraft for more than five years. It seems that we’ve become part of a marketing strategy to extend the old product’s life cycle. Secondly, the price for Bulgaria is now higher than for other buyers. The explanation that this is so because the F-16 is supposedly our first purchase seems rather strange. Thirdly, in order to avoid a higher price – higher than what had previously been approved by the parliament – the government resorted to removing part of the armament and manning. In other words, additional costs will now follow. Fourthly, we are buying a modification that still exists only on paper. What are the guarantees that the product will be successful when its delivery actually becomes possible? What are the guarantees that there will be no delays, as was the case with the F-35, for example? Fifthly, the fact that such an extremely expensive product has only six months of warranty, which is four times less than the warranty for electrical appliances in the EU, is a scandal. Sixthly, we paid the full price in advance – both for the drawing and for the promise to deliver the aircraft from 2023. But it recently became known that deliveries can actually last until January 2027! That is, the people of Bulgaria pay the whole amount in advance and receive equipment in 7-8 years. Here, as they say, common sense fails to appreciate the so-called Euro-Atlantic solidarity, which is unilaterally served by the current Bulgarian government.

Sputnik: The other day, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said that Sofia could block the start of negotiations on Northern Macedonia’s joining the EU if Skopje didn’t comply with the Treaty of Good-Neighbourliness. At the same time, the EU called on Northern Macedonia to comply with the terms of the treaty. In your opinion, can Bulgaria arrange a “Greek” scenario for Skopje? Recall that Athens has for many years blocked the Euro-Atlantic integration of its northern neighbour. Or, if the leading EU countries are determined to give Northern Macedonia the green light, will Sofia remove the conditions and stop arguing with its Western EU partners?

Rumen Gechev: For Bulgaria, the issue of Macedonia is extremely sensitive, since the land and population of this country are part of our historical past; today we speak different dialects of the same language. Of course, part of Northern Macedonian political elite has a different opinion and defends its own interests. We have irrefutable historical evidence that they steal our history, the history of Bulgaria. We cannot agree that the Bulgarian kings and historical figures are declared Macedonians and that their history books are full of distorted historical facts. Therefore, I would say that, unfortunately, the government led by Borisov hasn’t repeated the Greek scenario. Greece first resolved historical disputes with its Macedonian partners, including the issue of imitation monuments in Skopje, for example, the monument to Alexander the Great (according to the Prespa Agreement, monuments to the family of Alexander the Great should have signs explaining that the monuments belong to ancient history, which belongs to Greece), and only then gave the green light for Northern Macedonia’s Euro-Atlantic integration. The Bulgarian government first signed an agreement (on friendship, good neighbourliness and cooperation) promising to show historical tolerance to historical truth, and then waited for adequate steps from Northern Macedonia. Unfortunately, such steps didn’t follow and probably won’t follow. The problem is that the current government, trying to please Brussels and remain in power, may not use our right to veto Northern Macedonia’s entering the EU. I am convinced that most Bulgarians would consider such steps (no veto) national treason.

Sputnik: At the online EU-Western Balkans summit in early May, there was no question of the date of the start of negotiations on Northern Macedonia and Albania’s joining the EU, although back in 2018, Jean-Claude Juncker said that the Balkan candidates could consider 2025 as the date of their possible accession to the European Union, as soon as they fulfilled the necessary conditions. Do you think the situation with COVID-19 and the economic recession will alienate the prospects for Balkan countries’ joining the EU? Which country do you think is the most promising candidate, Serbia, Montenegro or Albania?

Rumen Gechev: Covid-19 will undoubtedly slow down the process of Albania, Northern Macedonia and Montenegro’s accession to the EU. At this stage, due to a variety of reasons, the issue of Serbia is out of the question. A slowdown is inevitable due to the fact that the EU doesn’t think about expansion. It has to deal with very serious economic and political problems in order to pay more attention to the periphery in the Balkans. The differences between the western and eastern EU countries are still significant. Brussels has serious political disagreements with the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland over the judicial system, migrant problems, the Istanbul Convention, their unwillingness to join the Eurozone, and so on. The EU is literally in a fever of problems, and Albania, Northern Macedonia and Montenegro’s accession is likely to make the situation even worse. In addition, two Balkan EU members, Greece and Bulgaria, have their own “preferences.” Greece would like to support Montenegro, while Bulgaria would prefer Northern Macedonia to Albania and Montenegro. First of all, you need to see whether the Eurozone can withstand the crisis and whether the EC finds a clear path and tools to continue building a common European home. Before that, there are unlikely to be any real steps to accept new members.

© Sputnik / Sergei Guneev Russian President Vladimir Putin Speaking at the launching ceremony of TurkStream pipeline

Sputnik: You have repeatedly called for lifting anti-Russia sanctions, indicating that of the EU member states, Bulgaria suffered the most from these economic measures. You also noted that at the same time, countries like Germany maintain economic relations with Russia, participating in the Nord Stream-2 project, while Bulgaria has buried the South Stream. In your opinion, can Turkstream somehow make up for these losses? Can it be that maybe the post-coronavirus era and the economic difficulties that accompany it are a good reason to lift various restrictive measures?

Rumen Gechev: Yes, both in our parliament and in the media I expressed the opinion that serving foreign economic interests entailed huge economic losses; we missed out on exceptional advantages. Because gas pipelines shouldn’t be seen only as transit fees sources, even if it is several hundred million euros per year. They would provide the economy with a stable supply (of energy resources) at preferential prices. After the failure of South Stream, we still have the opportunity to connect to the Turkstream, which our Prime Minister somewhat guilty calls “Balkan”. But no matter how we call it, we will now need to pay transit fees and margins to Turkey; but it could have been the other way around. It’s clear that the current Bulgarian government will strongly support anti-Russia sanctions so that it remains in power. For several consecutive years, nuclear reactors for Belene NPPs have been stored in a warehouse, almost two billion euros have been invested (in 2018, the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences published a report on Belene, saying that Bulgaria had invested 3 billion levs, or about €1.54 billion). And while the Czech Republic and Hungary expand the possibilities of using peaceful atomic energy with the help of Rosatom, our authorities still keep frozen billions in a promising investment project, a project that would provide Bulgarian companies and households with clean electricity at competitive prices. One can only hope that COVID-19 will bring something positive to relations between the EU and Russia. Looking at the development of macroeconomic indicators, the approaching mass bankruptcies and problems in banks, I think that pressure from EU members regarding sanctions lifting will only increase. The statements of the political leaders of Germany, France and Italy are encouraging in this direction. Lifting the sanctions would simplify the restructuring and adaptation of our economy to new conditions, as well as allow the completion of significant and, I would say, pained Bulgarian-Russian investment projects.

India from 18 May will enter phase four of the lockdown, which began on 25 March.

India went under complete lockdown on 25 March to contain the spread of COVID-19, which has infected 4,281,838 people worldwide and claimed 292,376 lives. The scientific community across the globe is working on different drugs and conducting clinical trials to figure out a way to end the spread of the virus.

Director of India’s National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER), Ahmedabad, Kiran Kalia talked to Sputnik about the current status of vaccine development, its production, as well as available drugs and treatments.

Sputnik: Scientists across the world are working on vaccines and drugs to find a cure for COVID-19. Where is India in the effort of making an effective drug/vaccine against the virus?

Kiran Kalia: We have phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials for the vaccines going on in foreign countries, but as our principal scientific advisor Dr Vijay Raghvan has mentioned, 30 different attempts are going on in India to develop the vaccine. The important one is the one by the National Institute of Virology in Pune. They have transferred the virus strain to Bharat Biotech International Limited. And they are developing the vaccine partnered with the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research).

We have a good manufacturing capability at Serum Institute of India, which has partnered with Oxford University to produce a large amount of vaccine doses. Although the Oxford University Vaccine is under phase 2 trial, they are so sure about the outputs of the trial that they have even started manufacturing. So when they get the trial result, they will have a lot of doses available for people.

These are the two vaccines where we are hopeful of the output.

Zydus Cadila, in the Indian scenario, is also working on a nucleic acid-based vaccine programme because they have their own independent vaccine production unit. We are hopeful Zydus will come out with some good vaccines.

Sputnik: When do we expect these vaccines to come into use?

Kiran Kalia: Vaccination will not start unless we get approval from the FDA (Food and Drug Administration). Because the clinical trials are going on, once they are over, only then can vaccination take place.

When any organisation, like Oxford University, has given good candidates for a vaccine; they are very sure about their result. They know that since this has cleared phase 1, phase 2 trial, they have even gone to the animal studies and found that it is a very effective vaccine. Based upon the previous data and how it has developed, you become sure that it will clear the final clinical trials on humans. If you are confident in your data, we take the risk of producing. Because we are in a situation where we don’t have sufficient time to wait for the trials to get over and then wait for production, which itself would take time. Maybe by the end of the year, we will have the vaccine. India has huge manufacturing capacity and whichever country comes with the vaccine after clearing the clinical trial, we will probably be the hub for making doses for them.

Sputnik: Like hyroxychloronique, what are the other drugs which are under consideration for treatment?

Kiran Kalia: Production of HCQ has had a little bit controversy due to the cardiac toxicity, but apart from the patients who are having cardiac complications, it has shown some beneficial effects on the other patients.

A lot of work is going on in the re-purposing of the existing anti-viral drugs. At NIPER also we are working in collaboration with the IIT (Indian Institute of Technology) Delhi and we have come out with some of the important molecules which show good potential as therapeutic targets for COVID-19.

Sputnik: How effective is the ayurvedic treatment?

Kiran Kalia: Ayurvedic organisation and AYUSH are also giving good recommendations for boosting immunity and the use of ancient knowledge of herbs, which they are trying on COVID patients. We have developed a similar strategy with Troikaa Pharma, where immunity boosters such as Zinc, selenium, Vitamin doses are given in combination with ayurvedic herbs and recommended breathing exercises. Such a support system is good for asymptomatic patients who are quarantined.

Some of the employees at Troikaa Pharma got infected with the virus, so we started giving them the treatment as they were quarantined in their houses and after 10 days of the diagnosis, they recovered. And when others at the office were given the same, none of them developed COVID.

It is not a treatment but a preventive measure with a combination strategy to improve immunity.

Sputnik: Are we going to see another wave of COVID-19 and a rise in cases?

Kiran Kalia: You cannot have a lockdown for this long. But people have to control themselves. Even when we open the lockdown, it will be opened in a restricted manner. This is a good stand. But if the green zone is open, then it should be under certain lockdown so that people from the orange and red zones do not go into it. But there are various factors in a country like ours where there is a huge population, and the socio-economic structure of the country is different from the developed countries. But ultimately, if you open up, this will develop herd immunity in the population. Although we believe us Indians have a good immunity system, probably when we develop herd immunity in our people, it may not spur very high. But this is all speculation. It is based on a certain growth rate and recovery rate, but the situation is different state-wise.

If it wasn’t for the lockdown, the situation in India would have been much worse.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

Workers who cannot perform their tasks from home have now been encouraged to return to action, and the public are now able to spend more time outside, as long as social distancing is maintained.

But has the messaging from Westminster been clear enough? Political Commentator Mandy Boylett gave her views on the matter.

Sputnik: Is Westminster right to begin loosening the UK’s Coronavirus lockdown?

Mandy Boylett: I think Boris Johnson is right to loosen the lockdown, because the devastation to the economy, and also the collateral damage to people’s health is too great, and I think that it is a very difficult balancing act, but I would have been tempted to release the lockdown further.

Sputnik: Has the messaging from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson regarding what the public can and can’t do once the Coronavirus lockdown is relaxed, clear enough?

Mandy Boylett: I think what he said is clear, but I think that it doesn’t make any sense. The fact that you can stay two metres apart from strangers in the park, but not your own family, the fact that you can have cleaners in your home, but not your own family, there are a lot of mixed messages there.

We need the police to be sensible as well. Say if my husband and I wanted to go and see a family member and go out exercising and stay two metres apart; to my mind that would be fine, but the police could say “both of you are out”, it should be just the husband or the wife, but that doesn’t make any sense because if one catches something, the other one would, so when messages like that don’t make any sense, then people are not likely to follow them.

Sputnik: Could the British Government have done more to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus within the UK?

Mandy Boylett: With the benefit of hindsight; there are a few things that I think they could have done. Instead of introducing the fourteen day quarantine now, they should have done it right at the start before there were any Coronavirus infections within the UK.

If after that any cases did emerge; and you were testing them and then tracing them, then that would have really helped, but instead they were letting people come directly from Wuhan and Italy, straight through the airports with no checks.

The other thing that they could have handled better are the care homes. The elderly patients were cleared out of the hospitals to make room in the hospitals for the influx of Coronavirus patients that were being expected, but these elderly people were being sent to care homes, they were not being tested for Coronavirus, and the consequence of that was the massive infection rate in care homes.

That could have been avoided, if the care homes had just closed their doors at the start; then they would not have had many infected patients, and it would never have happened, so those to me are the two things that went really badly wrong at the start.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

Women’s Aid Federation of England (Women’s Aid), which provides direct services to domestic abuse victims and engages in research and policy campaigning, has given an interview to Sputnik, outlining how the situation with domestic abuse has changed amid the pandemic. The organisation, however, underscored that the “true impact” of the lockdown may not be known until it is lifted and more abuse victims are in a position to reach out for help.

Sputnik: There have been reports of substantial increases in domestic violence in places that have implemented COVID-19 lockdowns, including in Wuhan, China, and Paris, France. Has the UK seen an increase in domestic abuse/violence since the lockdown was declared, and if so, by how much?

Women's Aid: 10 women and two children were killed by men in the first two weeks of the lockdown (between 23rd March and 6th April). This is three times higher than the average of three women killed every two weeks.

Additionally, data is not yet available to show the true impact of Covid-19 on survivors. Firstly, because it is a crime that takes place behind closed doors. Secondly, many women experiencing domestic abuse may only be able to reach out for help when lockdown measures lift.

Survivors are telling Women's Aid that abuse is escalating during Covid-19; our Survivor Survey found that 67% of survivors who are currently experiencing abuse told us that it had got worse since Covid-19. We are deeply concerned about the increased physical and emotional harm women and children experiencing domestic abuse may be facing during this period.

Sputnik: Can you explain exactly why the lockdown might exacerbate domestic abuse or violence?

Women's Aid: It is important to be clear that Covid-19 is not a cause of domestic abuse - only abusers are responsible for their horrific actions. The pandemic is clearly, however, escalating abuse, and closing down women's escape routes to safety, such as friends and family or the specialist support of domestic abuse services.

It's vital that women know that support continues to be available for them during this challenging period and that they will be listened to and helped. It is also important survivors know that domestic abuse is a crime and if you are in danger, always call 999.

Sputnik: Is there any difference between the nature of support you are providing to people during the lockdown to that which you would provide during 'normal' times?

Women's Aid: Support services are working around the clock to adapt to these unprecedented times. Refuges are supporting as many women as they can whilst facing new challenges such as staff sickness and the spread of the virus within shared accommodation. However, less than half (48.5%) of refuge service providers were able to comply with government guidance to stay open for existing service users and new referrals. Most anticipate an increase once measures are lifted, 66.7% stated they were concerned about future increases in demand.

Our direct services, which provide specialist support from domestic abuse support workers to survivors, have continued during this period and, as below, Live Chat has expanded to meet the increasing demand.

Within the first two weeks of lockdown, there was a 41% increase in users visiting Women's Aid's Live Chat site and we have doubled the Live Chat hours available to survivors during the Covid-19 lockdown. From Monday 20th April, the service has been open to survivors from 10am – 2pm Monday to Friday to provide a secure way for women to reach out and get specialist advice and support. Many women feel safer using online instant messaging with Live Chat than a phone call that may be overheard.

The Women's Aid Rail to Refuge scheme means that survivors with a refuge space can travel for free across England, Scotland and Wales. When lockdown started, the Rail Delivery Group were quick to respond to women's needs and launched a temporary, nationwide scheme.

Sputnik: What are the kinds of things that can be done to support victims of domestic abuse during this time period?

Women's Aid: For family or friends who are concerned about someone who may be experiencing domestic abuse, this lockdown period is difficult, as it means opportunities for face to face support and conversation are not available. And for survivors, it means that many routes to support outside the home are closed down [please see here for detailed advice].

Advice includes trying to keep a mobile phone on you and charged at all times and, if possible, keeping safely in touch with people you trust online or by phone – perhaps having a regular safe time they can check in with you.

And the key message is as mentioned above: please call 999 if you feel you are in immediate danger.

Sputnik: Is there a concern that people who may leave their homes seeking respite from an abusive household (as opposed to exercise) but are unable or unwilling to discuss the matter may be inadvertently targeted by the police for being outside without a 'reasonable excuse'? Are you aware of any such cases happening?

Women's Aid: ""Escaping risk of harm"" - including removing yourself from an argument - is an accepted and valid reason for leaving your home. The government and police forces have made clear that, if you are not safe at home, you are allowed to leave. And it's vital that this message continues to be clearly communicated.

Please note that leaving an abusive partner is statistically a dangerous time for a survivor and that survivors should access specialist support to help them leave safely.

Sputnik: In your opinion, are there sufficient resources being offered to organisations such as yours to deal with domestic abuse?

Women's Aid: Specialist domestic abuse services provided by Women's Aid members across the country are facing huge challenges in delivering life-saving work. After years of funding crisis, they are now experiencing a perfect storm of staff shortages, increased costs from remote working, lost fundraising income and challenges in accepting new referrals into refuges because of the risks of the virus spreading.

Together with other violence against women and girls (VAWG) organisations, we have been urging the government to deliver one simple, emergency fund for this life-saving sector.

The government's funding announcements are therefore very welcome. But we are concerned that it will not be enough to sustain the sector during this crisis, and we urge this to be kept under review as the impacts of the pandemic become clearer.

Funding must also be ring-fenced for specialist VAWG services led by and for BME women, deaf / disabled women, and LGBT survivors. These services are essential for fulfilling duties under the Equality Act and Public Sector Equality Duty, as well as meeting survivors' specific support needs, but they have been marginalised and excluded from existing funding systems.

Their inclusion, through a specific ring-fence, is essential for an equitable funding system which does not further entrench inequality and social injustice, which has been exacerbated in this pandemic.

But as global responses to the crisis reveal the efficacy of national-level strategies, it appears that such questions remain political and less based on scientific data.

Internationally-acclaimed author, journalist and academic Martin Jacques explained China's influence amid the ongoing crisis, namely relating to the country's handling of the coronavirus pandemic as well as current and future relationships with major global powers such as the United States, Great Britain and the European Union.

Sputnik: You mentioned that you had spoken to one of China's leading intellectuals on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Can you explain how China tackled the crisis as well as public sentiment related to Beijing's handling of the outbreak?

Martin Jacques: What was striking was, due to the lockdowns across Wuhan and Hubei province, they managed to completely stop COVID-19 from spreading across China.

For example, in Beijing there were only eight deaths and seven in Shanghai. This was really remarkable when you compare it to the United States, where it spread into every state and clearly the measures taken were grossly inadequate.

Despite fumbling through the early stages, China took hold of the pandemic in mid-January and realised the scope of the threat. The measures they took suppressed the virus, and there is now a progressive but rapid opening up of the economy.

So far, there has been no spikes in new cases, with most coming from elsewhere such as foreigners and Chinese overseas students. Traffic jams have returned to big cities, evidencing a rapid economic restoration, and the mood has changed a lot.

— Martin Jacques (@martjacques) May 6, 2020

According to my friend, in January, there was a lot of criticism of the government for its handling of the epidemic, felt by a wide cross-section of people. But now the mood has reversed, firstly after China got on top of the crisis as effectively, or even more effectively, than other countries the manner I just described.

The other is watching the mess that many Western countries made of the situation, such as acting too late or failing to use the time China had given to prepare, in addition to using very variable strategies. The outstanding example being Germany and the worst Britain, with the United States being the worst globally. The mood is that now, people are feeling very good about China's response, in light of what might have happened, which is what the West has done, with a few exceptions.

Sputnik: A recent Lancet study evidenced the importance of contact tracing in stopping the spread of the pandemic in cities such as Wuhan and Shenzhen. Which measures did Chinese authorities take and how effective were they?

Martin Jacques: The first move they made was to stop people moving around using a major lockdown applied across all major Chinese cities. This was crucial to stopping the transmission, even amid the Chinese New Year, where millions of people move around the country, inevitably fomenting the spread of the disease.

Secondly, they took everyone's temperature. China has very good on-the-ground means of checking, inspecting and controlling, with residents at apartment blocks in cities receiving temperature checks before entering the premises, and if a COVID-19 infection was suspected, tests were immediately given. If results were positive, you were quarantined and contacts traced via an app designed by Tencent (WeChat).

The programme was rolled out on a nationwide basis, and even now, despite the virus being fundamentally under control, they still use an app system to monitor the situation, using three colours--red, green and amber.

Green means you're virus-free and can do the maximum of what's allowed, amber restricts some movements due to prior or suspected infections and red confirms a diagnosis and imposes a 14-day quarantine, with close monitoring of the population with contact tracing.

Efforts were also boosted by the fact people expect the government to intervene, stemming from Confucian traditions where people respect and look up to authorities with both looked at as one. This is in contrast to some nations, with extremes such as the US, where the government is widely viewed as a threat rather than a friend.

Sputnik: US president Donald Trump has continued the US trade war on China and launched a campaign against Beijing amid the pandemic, accusing the latter of leaking COVID-19 from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and 'covering-up' the outbreak. Why specifically is he and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo doing this in the absence of support from international bodies, the scientific community and even the Pentagon?

Martin Jacques: You don't need to be a rocket scientist to know what he's up to here. America's COVID-19 response has been a disaster. He's been completely irresponsible and denied there was a problem and even talked about it being a hoax. He didn't think it would ever happen in the US and thought it was a 'Chinese problem'. As a result, the country flew blind.

Inevitably, the virus spread to the States in March and April, and I think that, to avoid the responsibility and embarrassment at home, tried to distract and deflect criticism by blaming China for the pandemic, firstly by calling it the 'Chinese' or 'Wuhan' virus, as if viruses have borders or nationality.

He later claimed, despite overwhelming consensus from scientists, that the virus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. I think it's nonsense, actually, and an attempt to cover up for presiding over a disaster across the US.

The origins and development of viruses are difficult to determine, and it's a job for scientists. French scientists stated that the first cases in France began in November or December, in line with China's cases, and Italy believes their cases originated in Germany around January or February, indicating it dates back further than most are talking about, possibly in a lesser, asymptomatic form or with milder symptoms, but became more aggressive after developing in Wuhan.

I read the other day that there were 14 variants of the disease, with the East Coast in the US having a more virulent strain than the West Coast.

So I think this is not about science, but about politics, and I'm concerned about what's emanating from the White House. The deterioration in relations between the US and China were at the behest of Washington, with a sharp departure from Sino-US relations underpinned since 1972, where China was to be regarded as a competitor, but is now seen as a threat.

In regards to COVID-19, the pandemic has moved to the centre of the argument, taking precedence over the US-China trade war. Trump mentioned on Thursday evening that COVID-19 was a greater threat to American life than Pearl Harbour or 9/11. He doesn't say that China is an enemy and is responsible, but accuses Beijing of failing to stop the disease.

This is very disturbing because it's poisoning the relationship with China. COVID-19 is going to be a key moment in history, namely in the last few decades, because of China's economic rise to power. But with COVID-19, the argument has shifted from a narrow question of economics to a question of governance, which the West has long regarded as its area of advantage. But the global response to the pandemic will shift the argument in favour of Beijing.

Sputnik: What do you believe is the future of Sino-British ties after the pandemic? How have relations change from previous administrations and will London follow Washington or follow an independent strategy?

Martin Jacques: During the [former Prime Minister] David Cameron and [Chancellor of the Excheqers] George Osborne government, Britain pursued a relatively cooperative and strong economic relationship. They welcomed Chinese investment, nuclear power, Huawei as an important investor, and an expanding range of cooperation.

Then, after the Cameron government fell and [Former Prime Minister] Theresa May was elected, the relationship didn't deteriorate, but went into a period of stagnation. Nothing was reversed but the growth in friendship was not resumed, either.

PM Boris Johnson has continued his predecessor's position, now with the important question of Huawei's 5G partnership, who was allowed 30 percent of the market. But there is a backlash mainly in the Conservative Party which wants to review Sino-UK ties, or even roll them back altogether or perceive China as a threat, obviously influenced by Trump's rise.

Relations have definitely cooled and suspicions deepened due to China growing stronger, moving from a fast-growing economy but not rivalling Western levels of technology, to China becoming a technological power and innovator, and sections of the UK have attempted to pigeonhole Beijing as a competitor or threat.

In the long run, this is a totally unsustainable position because Beijing is on the rise and the second-largest global economy, and is a leader in numerous technologies, and these ties will be essential.

It's not like in the former Soviet Union which was never strong in these areas save for the military, and China is and will continue to be a major economic success.

You can't just refuse to deal with a country like that, especially without ""cutting your nose to spite your face"". You may be able to do that to lesser countries not seen as competitors, but not to China, who has so much of the technology we are going to need.

Regarding COVID-19, a lot of essential supplies are made in China and no longer in the UK and other countries. So such a position is unsustainable in the long term, but in the short term could become more influential.

Europe has also been affected by the deterioration in Sino-US relations, and Europeans by and large don't follow or even like President Trump, but nevertheless feels challenged by China's rise and are concerned about how to 'defend' or 'protect' itself from Beijing, for example, the challenge the Belt and Road Initiative poses to the European Union.

I believe if we had the Cameron-Osborne approach to Sino-British ties, I may be more optimistic. But under the current position, I think they will worsen over a long time, namely in the context of COVID-19.

Many countries will go through a very painful period, much more than after the 2010 financial crisis, with a lot of dissatisfaction and people looking for someone to blame, who will blame Beijing in the Trump manner.

A recent poll revealed that roughly between two-thirds and three-fourths of the US population feel negative about China, pointing to a presidential election in November where Trump will play the anti-China card big time.

In April 1945, the family of four-year-old Uwe Trostel expected only cruelty from Soviet soldiers. However, the first encounter turned out to be completely different. Based on his mother’s stories, Uwe Trostel, who is now 79, spoke about the peaceful coexistence that endured with the Russians in a Czech town until 9 May.

Uwe Trostel is the deputy chairman of the Berlin Club of Memories and Stories of Life and a former member of the GDR Planning Commission. Recently, he spoke to Sputnik with a passionate appeal for rethinking relations with Russia due to the crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Moreover, considering the experience of the GDR, he explained why former East Germans still sympathise with Russia.

'The Russians Are Coming!'

End of April 1945, Hanichen, near Reichenberg, Czech Republic. The weather was chilly and generally horrible. Often, my mother and I spent days with my grandparents. In 1938, my parents built a new house, and we moved into it the same year. Some of our relatives lived on the top floor; a Czech midwife, Mrs Berek, lived under the roof.

Staying with my grandparents saved heating and there was always something to eat, although not enough, so that hunger was our constant companion. German soldiers were constantly coming from the east, looting in search of something to eat and something to wear to finally get rid of their uniforms. My mother gave them some old clothes of my father, who had gone to war, and from whom we hadn't heard since 1943. Every time a crowd of hungry, ragged, and freezing soldiers appeared in the city, there was a glimmer of hope that one of them was my father. But hope always disappeared as quickly as it sprouted.

Mother first asked where those soldiers came from, hoping to learn something about my father, but always in vain. Even worse, the soldiers advised her to flee to the Reich, as far west as possible, as quickly as possible, because it might only be a few weeks, if not days, before the Russians would arrive.

And then, they said, the worst that could possibly happen would happen: they would randomly kill Germans, rape women, loot and burn houses.

The soldiers almost panicked when talking about the horrors to be expected from the Russians, always advising my mother to ""flee"" to the west as soon as possible. But we had no relatives or acquaintances in Germany who could shelter us.

The days passed at the same pace: visiting my grandparents, watching German soldiers queuing in front of Tuschinsky's butcher shop when it was open, which was rarely the case anyway due to the lack of deliveries.

One day, my mother was, as usual, watching the soldiers, looking for my father among them. Suddenly she cried quietly: ""The Russians are coming!"" A few minutes later she cried out again: ""They're occupying our house!"" The house was built in 1938, not yet plastered, and was close to the forest from which the Russians came.

To the Russians, our house seemed suitable as accommodation. In the large fenced garden, they could set up tents, park their horses and equipment, and position two horse-drawn cannons. In the house itself, three officers occupied two rooms: the commander took the living room, and the two others occupied my parents' bedroom.

In the evening, we had to decide what to do next: spending the night at my grandparents' was tight and uncomfortable. With a mixture of despair, defiance, and fear, my mother took my hand and, despite my resistance, dragged me to the house. At the entrance were two Red Army soldiers, armed with rifles, ready to fire as we were approaching.

My mother said in a rather pitiful voice that this was our house and we wanted to get in. The soldiers, of course, didn't understand anything, but since mother, seeing they weren't showing aggression, insisted for us to be let in, they finally called the commander. He came, and rather rudely, but in good German, asked what we wanted. My mother explained that that was our house and we wanted to get home. The officer thought for a while and said that we would get a room. The whole house and the garden were confiscated for an indefinite period. We would have to follow all orders to avoid severe punishment.

My mother and I slept restlessly. The next morning, we watched the bustle of Russians through the window. They fed their horses and a terrible-looking – but tethered – dog, took coal from our basement, and wood from the nearby forest, as well as did many other things. It was clear that they were setting up for a long time. The officers moved the furniture, the soldiers set up three or four tents in the garden, which could accommodate 20 or 25 people.

Before lunch, the soldiers brought a field kitchen, made a fire, brought water, and started cooking something, stirring the water and adding some ingredients – we couldn’t see what it was. After a while – the stove had already been heated up, smoke was pouring out of the chimney, the water was boiling, and the smell of food spread everywhere – a line of soldiers equipped with bowls and spoons started lining up in front of it.

Meanwhile, my mother spread margarine over a small piece of bread, which we, of course, immediately ate. The smell of food from the field kitchen made our hunger unbearable. Almost fainting, we looked at the line of soldiers becoming longer and longer. My mother was desperate and finally gave me a plate and sent me to the end of the line.

The soldiers’ reaction was quite unexpected. It could be expected that they would send an additional eater away, but it turned out to be different: the last soldier in line laughed, took me in his arms, and put me on the shoulders of the one standing in front of him; and so I went on, accompanied by the laughter and hooting of the soldiers until I found myself by the stove.

The soup wasn't quite ready, so I had to wait. The soldiers were saying something to me, but I didn’t understand a word of Russian. As a result, I was saved by the cook, who took my bowl, filled it with fragrant soup, and said: ""enjoy your meal"" in Russian. I quickly ran to my mother, who was smiling, and we enjoyed the delicious Russian soup and were finally really full again for a very long time.

However, we ""sinned"": our grandmother was with us, but we completely forgot about her. My mother waited until the cook had filled the last soldier's bowl, and rather boldly approached him, pointing to the kettle and saying: ""babushka, babushka…"" The cook understood, scraped out the leftover food from the cauldron, and filled another bowl. So my grandmother ate well again for a long time.

The Russians stayed, and there was no sign that they were going to fight further. At the same time, there were rumours that they had already reached Berlin and that the war would soon be over. Every day we got our portion of lunch – not very much, but it was very tasty.

Mother suddenly started saying that the war might not last very long, and then at least we would have something to eat. Five or six days after the Russians had arrived, my mother noticed that all the dishes, linens, towels, etc. had disappeared. Apparently, the Russians stole everything. She cried and ran to the commander to complain. He was not friendly, but said that she should make a list of the missing things. With shaky hands, she wrote down the amount of cutlery, sheets, towels, etc., and gave the list to the officer. He grabbed the gun, went out into the courtyard where the soldiers’ tents were set up, pointed the gun at one of them, and shouted something (of course, we didn't understand anything).

Suddenly, towels, cups, forks, spoons, and other things flew out of the tent. The officer did the same ""trick"" with other tents. He told my mother to collect everything, check if everything was in place, and inform him. Mother, still trembling, counted everything, realised that everything was in place, and ran to the officer to thank him

It was then that the officer first started telling us something about his own life.

According to him, before the war, he was the director of a conservatory in Odessa; he played the piano and performed at concerts (this information is most likely not very reliable. Perhaps he was some kind of assistant professor). He was looking forward to the end of the war. Also, for the first time (neither we nor the neighbours had a radio), he told us that the war would end in a few days. He said that Soviet troops were already close to Hitler’s bunker and would probably capture it in the next few days.

Two or three days later, on 8 May, an indescribable cheer suddenly started among the Russians. They were crying: ""Hooray! Hooray!"" and something else that we did not understand. Among them was the commander; he had a box with bottles, which he triumphantly handed out to the soldiers.

When he saw my mother, he gave her a bottle and ordered to drink for the Soviet victory over Hitler's fascism.

He suddenly had several beer glasses in his hand that were filled with vodka. My mother had to drink one, but after the first sip, she vomited miserably, to the hooting of the Russian soldiers.

The Russians were drinking until nightfall, singing some melancholy songs, and then fell asleep. But, oddly enough, in the morning they woke up, lined up at the orders of the officer, and he delivered a speech in front of them, from which we could only understand the word “fascism"". In addition, he awarded several soldiers with medals that he attached to their chests.

After the speech, the soldiers continued singing Russian songs – this time very melodic and much more melancholic than the day before, when they were drunk. Most of them had tears running down their cheeks, and suddenly my mother burst into tears too. And since I didn’t understand why they were crying, I burst into tears as well.

The officer, apparently trying to calm my mother, spoke to her. The meaning of his rather long monologue boiled down to the fact that he was trying to make her understand that Germany and all Germans, especially the children, had no prospects, so he decided to take me to Odessa. He said that there I would have the brilliant prospects that the Soviet state could offer.

My mother was terribly afraid, fell to his knees in front of him, and burst into tears, even more, begging him to have mercy and not take a child from its mother, even a German. Then his face became stern, and he said that the Germans had taken much more from him; but since she was so heartless that she was ready to leave her child to starve, not knowing what would happen next, he agreed to respect her will. My mother felt relieved, she hugged him and wished him and his family all the best.

Suddenly the Russians started hurrying – everyone wanted to get home as soon as possible. They started loading their wagons, harnessed two horses, attached a cannon to them, and set off singing. In a hurry, they left some stuff, and these items came in handy for us in the following days and weeks.

And they left their huge shaggy dog. While they were here, no one dared to approach the dog – it barked and bared its teeth so that everyone was afraid. But having realised that it had been left alone, the dog suddenly became harmless, like a lamb.

It crawled towards us, licked my mother’s hands, and looked completely different from before. However, this didn’t save it: the butcher’s wife, Mrs Tuschinsky, lured it to their place, and over the next few days we could eat meat again. This is not to say that it was very tasty, but at least we had food…",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

The event promises to be a powerful rendition of classic songs celebrating the sacrifices of veterans across the United Kingdom and the Allied victory over Nazism on the Western Front.

The Royal Albert Hall, named by Queen Victoria after her late husband, Prince Albert, remains one of the UK's most iconic concert venues hosting leading acts from across the world since opening its doors in 1871.

Royal Albert Hall chief executive, Craig Hassall, discussed the unprecedented Victory Day performance and its significance, including ways people can continue to support the arts, amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Sputnik: What is special about the RAH's 75th VE Day performance? What is its significance and does it symbolise anything for your venue amid the ongoing pandemic?

Craig Hassall: This is the first behind-closed-doors performance in the Hall’s 150-year history. We had originally scheduled a VE Day performance for the 8 May, one of many shows which ultimately had to be cancelled due to the pandemic.

The Hall has always been a place of national celebration and commemoration, where poignant anniversaries are observed, and while we’ve staged ‘at home’ versions of other cancelled shows – with artists coming direct from their living rooms – that wouldn’t have been right for this event.

With the venue closed for the first time since the Blitz, we felt there was something incredibly powerful about staging a performance in an empty Hall. I also know that, for many, the words of ‘We’ll Meet Again’ have taken on a special significance in recent weeks, especially after being used by Queen Elizabeth II in her recent address to the nation, and it seemed fitting that Katherine Jenkins should perform that song as a virtual duet with Vera Lynn.

The event promises to be an extremely moving communal experience for people all over the world.

Sputnik: What kinds of support was provided to the venue and artist Katherine Jenkins OBE during the course of rehearsals?

Craig Hassall: It has involved a huge amount of planning, with the safety of everyone involved – artists, crew and staff – of paramount importance. We have a fantastic relationship with Katherine and were thrilled that she wanted to be involved.

The help we have had from her team, promoter Snappin’ Turtle, the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association (SSAFA) armed forces charity, YouTube and the Mayor of London’s office in making this event happen, has been truly extraordinary and we’re so grateful to them.

Paradise, Andy Craig Hassall, Royal Albert Hall CEO. 21 April 2017

Sputnik: How has the Royal Albert Hall been affected by the COVID-19 lockdown, and how can people support the venue in these difficult times?

Craig Hassall: We are facing enormous financial challenges at the moment. From March to May, we would have expected to take in around £8.5m, instead we refunded £3m in tickets.

We’re doing our best to keep entertaining the world during our closure, but our famous building is at risk, and the show can’t go on without support and donations. So now is really the chance for anyone who loves this place to show their appreciation and help us protect the future of the Royal Albert Hall.

Sputnik: What kinds of feedback have you received from audiences watching the online streams? Do you believe such performances will inspire interest in the arts amongst new demographics once the lockdown has been lifted?

Craig Hassall: We’ve had an incredible response to the Royal Albert Home series so far, with shows being streamed more than half a million times and audiences getting in touch from Kentucky to Kazakhstan to tell us how much the performances have meant to them during a difficult time.

— Mayor of London (gov.uk/coronavirus) (@MayorofLondon) May 7, 2020

The Hall exists promote a love of the arts and sciences, and during the closure this project has become a central part of that. It’s a new way for us to reach audiences – opening up our events to anyone with an internet connection – and something that we’re committed to continuing even after our re-opening.

Sputnik spoke about Amazon's success with Laurence Kotlikoff, a professor of Economics at Boston University.

Sputnik: According to reports, Jeff Bezos is set to be the world's first trillionaire. In your view, what are the main reasons that Amazon has been able to maintain its position on the market amid the pandemic?

Laurence Kotlikoff: The worry that people have about in-store shopping is the main reason. So it's very good news for Amazon, but really terrible days for retail outlets.

They are blocked in Boston and in Moscow, you're gonna find everything shut down. It's a ghost town. And every city in the US, with some exceptions in states that have decided to ignore the danger or the risk, they may find that they made a big mistake.

There are some countries that are able to continue maintaining retail outlets as they did before. But for the most part, we've got France, Italy, US, UK shut down. So the only way it can get the products is... over the internet from Amazon because I couldn't go down and try it out in IKEA as the store's been closed.

I do think that there's a question here whether these companies like Amazon need to be nationalised, to tell you the truth because it's a public marketplace.

The marketplace needs to be organised by governments. Some shops are not operating in a lot of countries on Sunday or Saturday, the weekends, because it's a day of rest for the workers. You don't want to have some people go to some stores if they are closed on Saturday and others are open.

It doesn't make sense. You want to coordinate. So if I go to the butcher shop, I can also walk across the street, go to the shoe store on the same day at the same hour. Otherwise, you don't get the same level of economic activity. So I think Amazon needs to be nationalised. And also the concentration of wealth going to one person or a set of people is not healthy for any country.

Sputnik: But what is the key element of Amazon’s success in comparison to any other company in this field?

Laurence Kotlikoff: What is their big advantage? They got in first. What is the big advantage of Facebook? They got in there first. It was random.

What about, a lot of companies that have been successful. We're just like a step ahead of the competition. But it's like a market where only one player can play. It makes sense to have one place as people don't want to go online to 20 different websites to see if they can find out what they can buy.

Sputnik: What impact can Amazon's success have on other competing firms on the US market?

Laurence Kotlikoff: Well, they can do what it has been doing. Same with realy big stores like Walmart. You can put small retailers out of business. Such stores as Walmart, Costco and IKEA are big box stores that are exploiting their natural monopolies.

So if you have a lot of small stores in a nice little town in the countryside and then maybe a Walmart... all the small stores in this little town suffer dramatically, and then the town is basically boarded up.

We have to think about, what kind of a society we want to have? People just buying from one company on the internet, buying from a couple of huge stores and having no community life, no towns, everybody just living inside their apartments or homes?

Is that the vision of our national urban planning that we're striving for or are we trying to maintain our way of life? Think about Europe. If you are in France or England, there are a few box stores, but they're pretty remote compared to what we have in the US.

It's a public good for everybody. Everybody can go out to the countryside and enjoy it. But then they (box stores) arrived in the Cotswolds, in the U.K. or the countryside of France.

In the US, you have to drive from the East Coast about a third way across the country to have that experience. I mean, there are places you can go in remote parts of New York state. We have a sprawling suburban system here.

We have decided that anybody can put up any kind of house, any kind of business on any road in any part of the country.

Sputnik: In your view, what can be done by the government and local authorities to help other companies keep afloat during this crisis?

Laurence Kotlikoff: During this crisis, we need to explain something to you that is a little different from the standard answer you might be expecting, which is we need to find a way to capture or kill this virus. And there is a method for doing that, which is very straightforward. Suppose you had the ability to give everybody a test every single day so if they were negative, you could give them a rating bracelet to wear during the day, and they could go back to work, school, go to movies, shop. And if they were red, if they were testing positive, they'd have to stay inside until they tested green again and then they could go out.

That would immediately mean that everybody on the outside would be safe to interact with. Everybody on the inside would be trying to survive this thing, getting health care and free fruit right now. That's an example of containing and killing the virus. Within a few weeks, we would have no virus problem.

It would have been killed off. The people with the virus would have either survived or passed away, unfortunately. And the people outside would be virus-free. Now, there are issues of false negatives in the testing, but this protocol would work even under those conditions because you have it retesting people every day, so you'll catch the false negatives, any kinds of mistakes. Statistically, the transmission rate will go to zero very, very quickly. We do not have the ability to test everybody every day. That's 7.6 billion tests a day around the world. But we have something that's almost as effective, basic as effective, which is called group testing, where you take 60 households and you pull together, you have them spit into the same cup - that's a household sample.

And then you add a reagent to that and then you take each cup, each household sample from 60 different households and you mix all that together. And now you have one batch sample, one called a sample, one group sample and you test that.

And if it's negative now, you can give a green bracelet to probably another 50 people in that household.

You've used one test to clear one hundred and fifty people. That's an enormous deficiency. A hundred and fifty to one efficiency. So we could do a group household testing in our country with six million tests, which we can get to within a couple weeks.

We could solve this problem in a month if we use them with intelligence and organized, and make it voluntary. So this is really not that hard.

Clearly, there's other ways to try and fight this: social distancing and masking... but we're not compliant.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

The pandemic has claimed 1,074 lives in India, according to the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

The Covid-19 lockdown has had an impact across business sectors. Digital payments platforms are also witnessing a number of challenges in terms of bookings in the entertainment and travel sectors. However, the lockdown due to the pandemic has also opened up new opportunities for digital payments companies. India’s major digital payment firm Paytm, for instance, has seen an increase in medical and insurance payments, among others.

Paytm's Senior Vice-President Amit Veer told Sputnik that the company has experienced a surge in online gaming, OTT content and video apps. He also said with Paytm being a homegrown Indian company, the new Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy will not have any bearing on it, explaining that the country's new FDI policy bars any investment from Chinese firms into an Indian company without permission from the Central government.

Sputnik: Has Paytm seen any significant increase in digital payments as a result of RBI’s suggestion for people to use digital modes of payment due to social distancing?

Amit Veer: During the ongoing lockdown, we are seeing increased adoption of digital payments for essential payments such as recharges, utility payments, insurance premiums, among others. In fact, more users are relying on varied payment use-cases available on the Paytm app and our teams are ensuring to increase the partnerships. We are confident more Indians will now understand the convenience of digital payments and develop the habit as well.

Sputnik: So what is the company’s experience in terms of data on digital transactions?

Amit Veer: India is embracing digital payments and making it part of their lives and a life-long habit. During the lockdown period, people have been making digital payments. We have seen a 30 percent increase in groceries and the same increase in payments in pharmacies. A 15 percent increase in spending for milk has been seen. As far as the user base is concerned, we have seen a 200 percent growth in the user base during the lockdown. Also, Paytm's had 50000 new sign-ups take place every day. Between 22 March and 15 April, 90 kilograms of gold have been purchased on the Paytm platform and 50 percent have been witnessed in insurance policy purchases. Recharges for DTH, data card and mobile have also seen growth in the period.

Sputnik: How is rural India reacting to digital payments? Please share data on new Paytm users from rural markets.

Amit Veer: Rural India is the backbone of our country and plays an integral role in India's overall growth and development. Paytm has been striving to promote financial inclusion and banking services in rural India and the results have been remarkable so far. We have expanded our services through the length and breadth of rural India. This has immensely helped during this ongoing COVID-19 crisis. More people in rural India have embraced Paytm's services during this lockdown and have been safely paying for utilities online. In fact, now they prefer scanning Paytm QR at their nearby Kirana (grocery) stores, and merchants are also happily accepting digital payments.

Sputnik: How is Paytm ensuring the smooth functioning of its businesses amid COVID-19?

Amit Veer: For us, it’s business as usual. We are working from home and doing our best to provide a seamless payment experience to our country. In fact, we have taken various initiatives, from collecting contribution for the PM Cares Fund to feeding minimum wage workers. Many of our colleagues have also contributed their salaries to this cause. We have ensured that the many frontline workers protecting us have masks and hygiene products are available.

Sputnik: Is there any specific reason for the 200% volume increase in broadband and data card bill payments?

Amit Veer: This growth can be directly attributed to the massive increase in data consumption, as more people are working from home during the lockdown. Also, online gaming, OTT content and video apps have seen a surge in both users and per session log-in time.

Sputnik: What will be the impact of new FDI guidelines, under which government permission has to be taken for investments from Chinese firms?

Amit Veer: Being a homegrown Indian company, the new FDI policy has no impact on us. As you are aware, post our last fundraiser, we are well-capitalised to serve new-age financial services to our fellow countrymen in India and continue our journey towards India's financial inclusion.

Sputnik: With the entertainment and travel sector being impacted in the post-Covid-19 world, which are the new segments where you see growth?

Amit Veer: Paytm Insider has moved towards online events, which are gaining traction. We are confident that these two verticals will bounce back stronger.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

Apart from digging into stories behind the conspiracy theories, the Grayzone also released many reports related to Northwest China’s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in recent months. For example, it released a report in March that stated ""forced labour"" stories hyped by some Western and US media and US-based nongovernmental organisations are orchestrated by the “US government, NATO, arms industry to drive Cold War PR blitz”.

To learn more about The Grayzone and its work, the Global Times reporter Liu Xin(GT) spoke to Max Blumenthal(B), an award-winning journalist and founder of the Grayzone.

GT: Do you think The Grayzone is anti-US, as some people criticized?

B: I'm an American. I live here in Washington, DC. Many of my neighbours, where I live in southeast Washington, DC, agree with my opinions. My neighbours are African-American and have been mostly left out by society. They understand that a country that is spending billions and trillions of dollars on an empire abroad is unable to bring them anything at home. And our readers are mostly American.

We are supported by the American people and people across the West. We are also supported by the American people in the greatest sense because we're supported by people from Latin America who are victims of the American empire, who have family living in the US. So, I think the most American thing to do is to expose an empire that is not giving back to the people.

We can see it so clearly in the time of coronavirus when so many people are being betrayed by this government, including American military personnel, like these sailors on Theodore Roosevelt, who have been simply betrayed. We care about them as well. That's really what our interest is in.

The only way they can hurt us is if they prove that we are printing lies, or if they're willing to debate us and show that our arguments are false. But, they're not able to do that.

GT: Some people claimed The Grayzone has a pro-China attitude, especially on the issues of coronavirus and Xinjiang. Do you agree?

B: The Greyzone does not speak for China any more than we speak for the United States. But we speak for people in the West who are opposed to war, and who are sceptical of the narratives that were being fed.

We're an independent website. We put a lot of effort into understanding the propaganda and stories that we hear. And, when we hear a story again and again and again, that is leading us to become more hostile towards another country, that's when our alarm bells go off, and we start to investigate.

One of our contributors, Ajit Singh, is a specialist in anti-China propaganda. He is also studying Chinese society and Chinese politics. He is in school to become an actual China expert. He helped expose stories behind reports on “millions of Uygurs in concentration camps in Xinjiang” by just simply looking at the sources and going deeper and deeper into the story until he found the original source.

One of the sources about [the claim] was a Chinese dissident organisation and a group of Chinese activists who are opposed to the Chinese Communist Party and who are based here in Washington. They're called Chinese human rights defenders, and they are funded by the NED, the US government's regime change arm. They produced a study that claimed that there were 600,000 and a million Uygurs in “concentration camps”.

But the study only interviewed a few Uygurs, and then from those interviews, they calculated the population of the villages from where those Uygurs came from and then extrapolated from the population, the total number. It's a completely phony methodology from a partisan US-backed group.

The other source was Adrian Zenz, who is also part of a right-wing, US government-backed group called Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation.

This group, as an extremist group, exists to erase socialism from the earth, and they are funded by the US government. They have meetings in the US capitol. They have a memorial here in Washington. Zenz himself is a Christian extremist, and he has said that he is on a mission from God against China. But this is the person who is considered the leading expert on Xinjiang in Washington, and who has been quoted in many respected journals on this story.

Ajit Singh, our contributor, looked into Zenz’s source and found that his source was a Uygur separatist publication called Istiqlal TV, which is broadcast out of Turkey and has given voice to many extremists. Basically, they appear to have invented it out of whole cloth.

I want to emphasize; I have not been to Xinjiang. I can't claim for certain what's happening there. I've read many reliable reports that there is an enormous amount of surveillance there. But the point is that we are being fed a story, which is aiming to make the American public believe, China is Nazi Germany, and that will only lead us to war. And, this story appears to be a massive exaggeration. I would like to talk about it to the American public. It's unfortunate that only a Chinese network wants to interview me about it. But that's the kind of situation we're in.

I would definitely like to come as a tourist and be able to see for myself. I would like to visit Wuhan and see everything with an open mind.

But now I'm stuck at home. I have not had a haircut in a month. Everything is closed, and it's very frightening to me that my government is using this situation to try to push us closer to war with a country that very few Americans understand, and very few Americans have visited.

All I can do from where I am right now is to expose the American institutions and figures that are deceiving the American public into war with, whether it's China, Venezuela, or Iran.

GT: As criticizing China has become politically correct in the US, have you come under some pressure for releasing stories on China?

B: Yes, we face heavy criticism, and we face many insults. People say, “you are genocide denier” or “you support other fascist country of China”. People say we support Russia and were paid by Venezuela and Cuba.

We face a lot of pressure for it. We faced fake lawsuits. I've been arrested and jailed because of the fake allegation made against me by the Venezuelan opposition here in Washington. Our writers are constantly insulted on social media. But one thing that people cannot do to us is accuse us of factual inaccuracies or debate us. We've extended the opportunity for some of our critics to debate us, and they usually say no.

The Greyzone was founded in 2015 to shine a light on the excesses of American foreign policy and how it was affecting us at home. Since then, we have taken on some of the hardest topics to discuss in the US, which I believe are leading the US to war.

We're simply there to expose the lie of the day. Whenever the public is being lied to and dragged into greater hostility with other nations, they don't understand; we're there to help them unpack the lies. We don't publish editorials. We publish simply reporting and analysis.

And we are an independent website. We are completely independently supported. We are not supported by any states or billionaires. We are supported by our readers.

East Jerusalem will see heavy traffic and tightened security later today as the city prepares for the opening of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's trial, who will now become not only the country's longest serving but also the first sitting PM to go before a tribunal.

Citing an unwillingness to breach regulations imposed by Israel's Ministry of Health banning crowds in enclosed spaces, Netanyahu tried to skip his first hearing but the High Court decided his presence was ""necessary"", ruling that only a few people would be let inside the courtroom.

The trial, previously scheduled for mid-March, was postponed due to the outbreak of the coronavirus and is set to kick off at 13:00 GMT. Netanyahu is expected to arrive at the court accompanied by a retinue of bodyguards and security personnel as well as several of his loyalists, members of his party Likud.

Despite initial reports that the trial would be aired live, Israel's High Court ruled that the general public will not be able to see what is arguably the most scandalous affair in the nation's history

Instead, reporters who would usually be positioned inside the courtroom, will now need to settle for a room on another floor, away from the action, watching the hearing from a TV screen. This is a definite relief for Netanyahu, who wanted to avoid being seen as a criminal standing up in front of judges just like any other ordinary citizen.

Crime Minister?

The only problem is that most of the nation already sees him as such. A 2019 poll released after Netanyahu's cases were made public showed that 55 percent of Israelis considered the PM corrupt. At the same time, the survey also highlighted the disbelief Israel's public felt towards Attorney General Avichai Mandelblitt, who indicted the prime minister, with 45 percent of respondents saying they had little trust in him and the judiciary system he represented.

Soon after the AG rolled out his indictment in November 2019, accusing the PM in a series of graft probes, people took to the streets across the country accusing him of joining forces with left-wing circles in a bid to bring Netanyahu down.

Similar protests are expected later today in front of the court where the trial is set to take place. At least a 1,000 Netanyahu supporters are slated to arrive to back the PM and send a clear message to the judiciary that their ""biased"" actions are considered illegitimate.

They won't be alone. A year ago, a poll conducted by the newspaper Israel Hayom, found that 61 percent of Israelis believed the President of the country's High Court Esther Hayout held left-wing views which influenced her decisions. Similar findings have also been made about other players in the system including the deputy attorney general and state prosecutor.

Now, however, Netanyahu supporters are also afraid that the judges set to hear the PM's case will also be biased against him. Their primary concern is aimed at Rivka Freedman-Feldman. In 2015, she found former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert guilty of bribery, and loyalists of the current PM are concerned that history might repeat itself.

What to Expect?

Today's hearing is not expected to take very long. It will start with Prosecutor Liat Ben Ari reading out her accusations, with Netanyahu expected to answer whether he understands the meaning of what was put out in front of him, while his defence is set to refute all accusations against their client, proclaiming the PM's innocence.

But the more advanced stages of the trial, where judges are expected to go through hundreds of documents and hear 333 witnesses from the prosecution in addition to a long list from the defence, could take up to two years, if sessions are held once or twice a week.

Given that the cases are so important and full of information, requiring time and preparation, the judges might decide to space out the hearings, stretching out the process for ages.

Netanyahu, however, is not planning to sit on his hands. Appointing loyalist Amir Ohana as homeland security minister, the prime minister secured access to the nation's most delicate and sensitive probes and obtained a means to rattle the judiciary by interfering in police investigations.

Benjamin Netanyahu is facing charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust in a series of graft probes but denies any wrongdoing.

In what's known as case 4000, the most significant of the three, he is accused of buying positive press in one of Israel's leading websites Walla in exchange for promoting the interests of the site's owner Shaul Alovich.

In case 2000, Netanyahu is also accused of attempting to buy positive coverage for himself and his family, this time from Noni Mozes, the owner of news conglomerate Yedioth Ahronot.

Unlike case 4000, where the PM allegedly bribed Alovich, the case with Mozes is lighter as Netanyahu is only accused of breaching the trust of the public by not rejecting Mozes' proposal and considering to impose a series of regulations that would harm Yedioth Ahronot's main competitor.

In case 1000, the prosecution wants to hold Netanyahu accountable for receiving almost $200,000 worth of gifts from a rich donor, including cigars, pink champagne, and jewels in exchange for letting Arnon Milchin evade taxes.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

Precipitation in the Holy Land in general, and the level of the Sea of Galilee in particular have long been thoroughly studied, a report by Haaretz suggests, detailing current excavation efforts in an area called el-Araj, a historic spot where events depicted in the Bible allegedly unfolded.

After several years of drought, whole parts of el-Araj are now sitting in water due to this year’s inundation, with the relatively higher points resembling tiny islands purported to be concealing real historic treasures.

The beyond normal precipitation has reportedly suspended excavation efforts originally slated for early summer 2020, which is projected to also be marked by the continuing coronavirus crisis and lockdowns.

“At the moment, the water is 80 centimetres [2 feet, 7 inches] above the mosaic of the Byzantine church, which was built 500 years after Jesus’ time”, archaeologist Motti Aviam pointed out, adding that researchers have tentatively identified the structure as the Church of the Apostles, which Christian tradition says was built over the home of Jesus’ disciples Peter and Andrew in the village of Bethsaida.

They came to believe it was a church by, among other things, gilded glass mosaic, known to have been typically used in wall mosaics in churches as well as fragments of the chancel screen. Also, it is the only Byzantine church found so far that is in line with the description given by a Bavarian bishop named Willibald who reportedly toured the Holy Land in the year 725.

Meanwhile, El-Araj, also known as Beit Habek, is just one of the candidates for the site of the ancient Jewish fishing village of Bethsaida, mentioned in the New Testament as the birthplace of three of Jesus’ disciples. The other major competitor is et-Tell, a little further north of el-Araj on the north shore of the Sea of Galilee.

The excavation there is being led by the archaeologist Professor Rami Arav of the University of Nebraska at Omaha. According to Arav, historical documents say that Bethsaida existed from the late Hellenistic period – in particular, in the first half of the first century, when his geologists say el-Araj was covered by water, as it is now, “Philip the son of Herod granting the old village rights of a Greek polis, and Jesus, were all in the first half of the first century, not the second half”, Arav was quoted as saying.

In the not so distant past, the site of el-Araj housed the “winter palace”, or Beit Habek – a two-storey building dating back to the Ottoman era.

After it was blown up in December 1955 by Israeli paratroopers, the ancient ruins survived the attack and for the last four years have been under archaeological exploration by the Kinneret College archaeological institute, run by Aviam, and Prof. R.

The long-time political rivals agreed to share power in the government on Sunday after months of feuding over the results of last September's election. Ghani was awarded the victory but Abdullah rejected the outcome and formed a parallel cabinet.

Hopes are that the newly found unity will help the Afghan government get the country back on track toward stability. Abdullah will now lead negotiations with Taliban insurgents that aim to end decades of fighting as the country struggles to contain the coronavirus outbreak.

Obstacles Remain

The power-sharing deal will likely strengthen the government's hand in the future talks with the Taliban but it cannot resolve the current stalemate, Marvin Weinbaum, the director for Afghanistan and Pakistan Studies at the Washington-based Middle East Institute, said.

""Certainly, without a deal the government side would find itself in a decidedly weak bargaining position. But while the compromise deal may serve the need for the unity needed by the Afghan regime, it has not in any substantial way removed the obstacles that block progress toward reaching a peace agreement with the Taliban,"" he said.

The deal is unlikely to change the Taliban's perception of the Afghan government as a US ""puppet,"" while Ghani's decision to resume the offensive against the militants after the hospital and funeral attacks — most likely carried out by the affiliate of Daesh* (also known as ISIS/IS/Islamic State, banned as a terror group in Russia) — could be another setback to the peace process.

Uneasy Peace

Jabeur Fathally, a professor of international and comparative law at the University of Ottawa in Canada, said the Afghan president and his top negotiator apparently put their rivalry aside to avoid armed clashes between their supporters but their core differences remained and could be exploited by the Taliban.

""This agreement will calm and ease the tension between the supporters of these two personalities and will certainly allow the resumption of dialogue with the Taliban but we will see in the next few months that the two personalities will not have the same agendas, objectives and strategies towards the Taliban,"" Fathally said.

The expert warned that insurgents will try to play on the simmering tensions between the two political heavyweights to weaken them and impose their conditions in the intra-Afghan negotiations.

Robert Jervis, a professor of international politics in the Department of Political Science at Columbia University in New York, said that infighting between the two Afghan leaders could reemerge later in the negotiating process to the detriment of the peace efforts.

""Having Abdullah lead the delegation in negotiations with the Taliban may (slightly) increase the chance of reaching an agreement by giving multiple factions in the government incentives to work out a deal. The danger, of course, is that Ghani will be given reason to object to anything that Abdullah puts forward,"" he said.

What About the Pandemic?

The power-sharing agreement is likely to boost the government's response to the coronavirus epidemic, which has infected almost 10,000 people and killed more than 200 across Afghanistan.

""The agreement allows for a coordinated public health response to the pandemic that was not possible under the backdrop of a political infighting that had distracted the government from focusing on the health challenge,"" Marvin Weinbaum said.

Weinbaum added that mounting a successful campaign to contain the spread of the disease would be ""exceedingly difficult"" without a nationwide ceasefire with the Taliban, whose efforts to address the epidemic in areas under their control have been limited at best.

Jabeur Fathally said the deal was not going to change a lot in Afghanis' daily life but would allow the Afghan government to have more access to international relief aid, particularly from the United States and the European Union.

Since then, the two countries have waged what has often been referred to as a trade war, exchanging several rounds of reciprocal tariffs.

The Trump administration presented a report titled ""U.S. Strategic Approach to the People’s Republic of China"" to members of Congress on 20 May, saying that it acknowledges the existence of strategic competition with Beijing and will protect its interests accordingly in light of a direct challenge posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

Dr Ching Chang, a research fellow at the Society for Strategic Studies and a leading Chinese military and strategy analyst in Taiwan, has shared his views on the recently escalated Sino-American tensions, which were exacerbated by Washington's accusations against Beijing of ""mishandling"" the pandemic.

Sputnik: How would you explain the acceleration in the split between the US and China and growing criticism from the American side?

Dr Ching Chang: We should very cautiously identify the fundamental Sino-US animosities and the short-term disputes between the US and China in the foreseeable future. Some issues are associated with the temporary political assumptions in the moments of the US election campaign, such as unbalanced trade, blaming the COVID-19 epidemics and commercial competition. Nonetheless, certain matters may seriously affect the global power status in the long run, like influences in international organisations, technology specifications and circulation level rivalry of the currency.

The criticism from the United States is really not the dominant factor since most of the nations in the world may execute their own national interest calculus and may ignore these US viewpoints. However, the privileges of setting the institutions in the international community and supports as well as consents from other nations in the world will decide the future leadership position. Beijing has a strong ambition to embrace globalisation and Washington, by contrast, has a firm intention to secure its own superiority above other nations and less willingness to commit to the world order as before. This difference in mentality is the eventual factor that is accelerating the rivalry between Beijing and Washington.

Sputnik: The 20-page report expands on President Donald Trump's get-tough rhetoric that he hopes will resonate with voters about China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. How viable do you consider such expectations to be?

Dr Ching Chang: We should have no surprise about the base-tone of this report. This is actually very sensible for serving Trump’s election campaign strategy. The matter now is not literally how you say and what you say at the moment, but the consequences of abolishing the epidemic control after many states gradually lift the shut-down status and resume normal life. Six months are still left before the voting date. At the moment, President Trump holds the privilege of dominating the information and public presences. His competitor, Mr Biden, is in an inferior position to provide his perspectives to the American general public. This situation will be changed after the election campaign starts to get hot whilst most of the states lift the manoeuvre restrictions.

Whether Trump’s scheme of mass distraction can be viable is hard to say at the moment. Trump is a very agile politician. Should he change his statements or positions in the following months may indicate whether he may still believe that by tarnishing Beijing he could save his political future. We should never be surprised that such a hairpin style turn may occur before the vote. Trump will do whatever it takes to get the votes he would like to have. The moral standard of a businessman may impress us all the time.

Sputnik: The Trump administration sees ""no value"" in engaging with Beijing for symbolism and pageantry, according to the report. What are the chances of the two countries restoring relations to pre-COVID levels? If this isn’t likely, then what kind of rhetoric do you expect in the short-run?

First, it is hard to well define a pre-COVID level, if we may still remember Trump’s attitude was changed dramatically in February once he noticed that the COVID outbreak may hurt his election campaign programme. He first blamed Democrats and Congress and subsequently targeted the WHO. After these struck back and seemed not helpful to his approval rate, Mr Trump shifted the target to Beijing. I would like to argue that there was no pre-COVID level of Sino-US relations, but only Mr Trump’s personal political preferences and his requirements for political consumptions.

History is a dynamic process. All the progress may lead us to a totally new situation. We should never expect to restore anything that originally existed before. Given the international mechanism and treaties withdrawn by Trump’ administration so far. No matter who can be the successor of Mr Trump, the next US president, next year or another four more years, will need to face a world needing restorations after Trump’s era. This is exactly the reason why the leadership in Beijing rarely says anything to Mr Trump’s comments on his Twitter. He should ask who feels “no value” to engage with him and why they think so.

Russia, however, started to build up its reserves long before the crisis emerged.

Russia has become a saviour of the global gold markets as the pandemic has spurred abnormally high demand for the precious metal while it has at the same time also crippled companies' ability to produce gold in the amounts requested by market players, the vice president of Russian gold industry giant Zolotoy Monetnyy Dom, Alexey Vyazovsky, says.

""When a pandemic or war emerges, gold is everyone's first choice to buy. But right now buying gold is problematic. Refineries where gold alloys are purified, mints where gold coins are minted, some banks and exchanges, all infrastructure, including even some mines are closed due to quarantine"", Vyazovsky says.

The gold expert explains that Russia mines some 300 tonnes of gold each year and has huge amounts of gold stashed in reserves - something that is now saving the market. Vyazovsky stresses that the Russian government has allowed companies to export gold, with the main flows of the precious metal now going to the two main European gold hubs - London and Switzerland - which were experiencing acute shortages of physical gold.

This situation turned out to be highly profitable for Russian gold companies, the expert notes.

""Gold prices are on the rise in Russia as it's traded in rubles. So now the gold-mining companies are getting incredible profits"", Vyazovsky says.

Russia has indeed been boosting its gold reserves for some time and started doing so long before the coronavirus pandemic hit the world. When Moscow started dumping its holdings of US Treasury bonds, it also started buying the precious metal, supposedly as a replacement for its dollar-nominated assets. In 2019, Russia became the biggest gold buyer in the world, closely followed by China.

On Thursday, the UK government tasked civil servants with developing a new plan, codenamed Project Defend, to be less dependent on China.

The project will be led by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and consists of two separate groups of officials that have been tasked with ensuring that the UK will not be reliant on one single country for the import of strategic goods.

London’s desire to exert control over supply lines comes in the wake of a joint EU recovery proposal published by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday.

The two leaders called for greater EU sovereignty over the production of medical equipment and pharmaceuticals. They proposed establishing a so-called Recovery Fund, which would provide 500 billion euros ($550 billion) in EU budget spending to support the sectors and regions that were hit hardest. The bloc is yet to reach a consensus on how to fund the economy reboot.

Almost half of the global cases of COVID-19 have been reported on the European continent, as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control announced that 1,773,658 cases of the disease, as well as 166,580 deaths have been reported in the EU, countries of the European Economic Area and the UK.

Reindustralisation of Europe

Last month, the French government ordered more than 2 billion masks from China, as the pandemic situation was becoming direr. Paris also pledged to ramp up its own production of personal protective items due to the acute shortage.

The hardest-hit EU countries have denounced the dependence on other countries as the reason for the initial difficulties of combating the coronavirus internally.

""I fear that we are witnessing a lot of political gesticulation, about ‘re-industrializing Europe’ during this crisis. It is obvious that governments must ask themselves questions of security and public health for essential supplies. It is also true that the liberal policy of globalization has caused Europe to de-industrialize to the benefit of emerging countries which have since become economic giants or the workshop of the world, such as China,"" Michel Liegeois, a professor at the Belgium’s University of Louvain, told Sputnik.

According to Liegeois, the European Union could potentially introduce tariffs on imports from China, but that would lead to immediate retaliatory measures by China.

""I think it is difficult to go beyond the re-creation of strategic stocks, for facial masks for example, and possibly an industrial relocation for the same strategic supplies. A commercial renegotiation with China, if possible, would be very difficult and would require changes to the competition rules,"" the professor noted.

According to Matteo Volpe, sales director for DomusLift – IGV Group, a large producer of lifts in Italy, ""the EU and the national governments have led a policy of laissez-faire, which has resulted in endemic unemployment of low-qualified workers in Europe, since most of the production has been sent to Asia, to reduce costs. Overproduction of the workers has increased labor costs that have pushed companies to delocalize to China.""

Reindustrialisation initiatives, similar to the UK’s Project Defend, will certainly be taken to the parliamentary debates, while proposals made by the Left and Right parties in many European countries would not be immediately qualified as strategic.

What Economists Have to Say

Commenting on repatriating industries and reindustrialisation in Europe, French economist Charles Gave told Sputnik that gaining independence from China would carry a high cost.

""A return to self-sufficiency in Europe would have a cost. Some might try to repatriate pharmaceutical production from India or China, but the costs in Europe are much higher: wages, taxes, social security, binding standards. Even for a very robotized factory, this is not easy. If there is a relocation from China, the manufacturer will prefer to set up the new factory in Vietnam or Ukraine, for example. It is not a zero-sum game,"" Gave said.

According to the economist, keeping industries in China is more profitable as labor costs, environmental requirements and lower security standards are less demanding than those in the EU.

""And paradoxically, the departure of China could increase the globalization of the economy; by dispersing production units elsewhere, from Asia to North Africa. In addition, China could outsource the factories it controls from home to other countries: China could set up a factory in Thailand, or Portugal for example,"" Gave suggested.

On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel unveiled a joint plan to boost EU recovery from the coronavirus crisis after weeks of discussions on how to deploy the billions of euros needed to end the economic shock and recession.

The plan promoted by France and Germany calls for the creation of a €500 billion recovery fund able to offer grants to the worst-affected countries and regions.

IFO Institute President (Leibniz Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich) Clemens Fuest has supported the German-French initiative to help the EU and offered his views on the matter during an online press conference with the Association of Foreign Press in Germany (VAP).

Sputnik: What do you think of Macron and Merkel’s new plan to restore the EU through the European Commission? We can already see resistance to these plans. Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden insist that the EU only issue repayable loans, not subsidies. How can you explain the changed position on the part of the federal government? The federal government also spoke out against the so-called corona bonds.

Mr Fuest: What has been agreed here doesn’t really concern corona bonds. Corona bonds were not a clear, clearly defined concept, while what has been proposed is a clear, feasible concept. I very much welcome it. I think it’s important that Germany and France have come forward with a common initiative, the two states that quite often have different positions regarding EU finances, the two states that are very important to promote issues. Of course, other countries are also important and should be involved in this matter.

If we compare this with corona bonds, the corona bonds initiative, in my view, was a domestic policy initiative of the countries that presented this plan. They publicly demanded something from other states, knowing that they would refuse. It originally was something non-working. And such a policy, in my opinion, is taking place in Europe for domestic political reasons and is not constructive at the European level.

I think that this initiative is constructive. A model has been agreed that can be implemented. The huge challenge that we are facing regarding this fund is to show that the costs that are coming up here have added value due to distribution at the European level.

This means that it’s necessary to show that if the EU spends this money, it will be more beneficial than if member states lend money and spend it themselves. They could do that too. Member states must guarantee these debts. And the EU has virtually no income of its own.

Therefore, it’s all based on member states guarantees. And it must be shown that this European fund, the money that is given out, is more useful, that this money is used on things that national expenses cannot provide.

There is considerable potential for the aforementioned European added value. For example, the added value may consist in the fact that all this will become insurance. That money will go to countries that have been hit hardest by the crisis. We have some ideas in this regard. But we still don’t know exactly how much states will be affected.

According to the IMF forecast, Germany has a negative growth of seven percent, and France has a negative growth of eight percent. In Italy, negative growth is nine percent. According to the IMF forecast, this means that these three states have been affected to a similar extent. We don’t know whether things will get to this; it’s still unclear who will get this insurance money and who will pay it.

If the whole thing is organized in such a way that those who are hardest hit, but who can insure themselves against this crisis, get something, it is creating added value. A nation-state cannot insure itself.

But it wouldn’t help if all member states were hit equally. An insurance community where everyone suffers the same doesn’t help. However, added value will appear if the crisis is asymmetrical.

In the end, solidarity is also added value. This means that there is interest on the part of all European states that no country will collapse economically or destabilize. And that could also be European value-added. But, nevertheless, it won’t be easy to try to really spend money better than national money. This will need to be well demonstrated. If it works, this is very good.

I think the initiative for this fund at the European level is so important because it is a political signal that the EU is alive, that the EU is acting in a crisis like this. That is a very important signal. A signal that the EU will still be there after the crisis is a signal to everyone. It’s vital for the EU that certain actions are being taken here and that we can count on success.

On Political Debate

I expect political debate in parliament, as well as in other European countries. They are also very important, namely regarding where the will money be used and how it be determined that added value appears. What does this mean for future debt policy in Europe?

We need to understand that Rubicon is crossed here. It is fundamental reform, extensive debt financing at the European level. This will raise the question of whether the whole thing will be a dam break, whether we’ll have a sharp rise in public debt because we have a new level at which we also incur government debt, namely the European level.

It’s a very serious question. The answer given in the German-French document is correct. It says that there will be a repayment plan for these debts. And member countries must pay for it.

There will be such a repayment plan that, I hope – that would be right – in the event of the next crisis, the state debt quota in Europe as a whole – national, regional and European – won’t be higher than before this crisis. It will be better if it is lower. All of these issues will be discussed.

Question from France: Is this initiative Merkel’s answer to Macron?

I don’t think this is Merkel’s response to Macron, because this is the response to the crisis. The German-French document says a lot about European health policy. It’s necessary to create response groups.

It would be great if we had them when the pandemic broke out. This fund is a unique thing, a unique debt mechanism. It remains to be seen whether it will remain unique. After a while, new requirements for further debts will appear.

And this will lead to contradictions. Critics both in France and in my country, of course, will say that this is a dam break. Today they borrow, and tomorrow someone will want to borrow again. I think this is one of the risks you are taking.

I personally think that having weighed everything, it’s right to take risks.

Question from France: Is this the best initiative?

You can put down lots of possibilities on a blank piece of paper. I think this is a very good initiative. But many questions remain open. The package’s effectiveness will depend on how long it lasts. We must remember that EU decisions need to be ratified.

This begs the question: should it be ratified? Could it be that we will have a long-term ratification process, and these funds will come when the crisis has long ended? One can only hope that everyone understands this; there is an urgency for everyone involved.

But these are all open questions. This concept should be specified.

The EU needs to show signs of life. The fund should be created and it should become successful because it’s very difficult to imagine that the EU won’t do anything in this crisis. Critics will need to be convinced by showing that added value is created for everyone.

Question from Ukraine: is €500 billion a lot?

€500 billion amounts to about three percent of the EU’s GDP, maybe a little more. This is the amount paid over several years. This means that this is not a giant fiscal package, but it is a lot of money, first of all, compared to the current EU budget, which is a little more than one percent of GDP per year. For three years, this would be a doubling of costs.

The money should go to European programmes and it will be spent as part of the EU budget. Compared to what we are doing in Europe today, what is the EU budget, this is a lot of money.

Compared to national budgets, this, of course, is not that much. But the concept that money needs to be spent correctly is more important than the amount. In the German-French initiative, I understand it this way: here we are talking about spending within the EU budget, not about loans to someone there.

US-based political analyst Don Debar reflects on the latest US moves towards China and the WHO amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Sputnik: US President Donald Trump has shared a letter in his Twitter account in which he threatened to make the WHO funding freeze permanent and ""reconsider our membership"" in the organisation if the agency ""does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days"". How likely is it that the US will permanently freeze its funding to WHO?

Don Debar: It's quite possible that they will not just freeze it, even roll it back. You know, there are several things at play around this question. First is that Trump's base, the core Republican voters have always had an antipathy towards the United Nations and, you know, the institutions of the United Nations, the World Health Organization is, of course, you know, one of the children of the United Nations. And even back in the 50s, they loved candidates that were running on the Republican Party platform, (calling for the White House to) get the U.S. out of the U.N. and the U.N. out of the U.S.

So there is a latent sentiment in that direction that he's playing to the base on. And so you have to take with that grain of salt - him saying this is an opportunity for him to do some U.N. bashing in coded language to some core part of his constituency, the Republican Party constituency.

But that said, this also comes in the midst of his ongoing trade dispute. You know, the renegotiation essentially of the economic relations between the United States and China. And that's been a project of the Trump administration's, you know, from the beginning. They announce they were going to do. The trade situation was unfavourable to the United States, that the employment situation was completely destroyed in the United States and this was all going to be remedied with hard negotiations with China.

Well, you know, this virus epidemic or a pandemic has provided a perfect opportunity for him to China bash that he’s taken full advantage of. When he's taking full advantage of, he's blaming this entire megillah on China, on their being secretive, on their being incompetent, on just how you should have been played better with us. And so as he's having negotiations with China saying, I want you to drop this tariff and, you know, renegotiate that. He's also screaming in the public sphere, you know, things that China would probably prefer, he said. Right. Look, I'll go. What do you want us to stop? What do you want? What do you want? No, this a negotiation tactic. And it's that's got to be looked at in that context as well.

Now, this was the World Health Organization itself goes. It was a journalist, for example, an international journalist knows that the U.N.'s. It may be the best organization of its kind available right now, but it is far from ideal or perfect.

And certainly its governance and operation are a reflection of various power of various elites around the world and particularly Western imperialism, United States. If you deal with the media operation at the UN as I know you do and I do. You know that a speech by the foreign Minister of Iran at a U.N. Security Council meeting. Even if he does it in English, which he's done plenty of times, it will not appear in the media, for a download that afternoon or that news cycle or for 10 days, if ever, whereas the slightest utterance from whichever knucklehead the United States has as a permanent representative at the time, will go out exactly like that.

And Trump mentions this in a way at his press conference yesterday saying, you know, the United States spends $450 million towards the WHO budget. And China spends $40 million towards their budget, maybe i’ll cut this back. We're talking about being way out of scale in terms of operations.

© REUTERS / LEAH MILLIS U.S. President Donald Trump talks with Will Guidara of the Independent Restaurant Coalition, and his economic advisor Larry Kudlow at the conclusion of a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic meeting with restaurant executives and industry leaders in the State Dining Room at the White House in Washington, U.S., May 18, 2020.

Now if they're not responding to what Trump wants, however, we have to understand that Trump's power - and elite and state power of the United States - are not the same. People that are in the operating elite, of the officer class, or whatever, at the United Nations, the officials, those are people that are there as part of what they call the deep state. Those are people that were appointed over the years, part of a permanent bureaucracy. They are vetted through the EU, through Congress, through State Department, through the World Bank, through IMF, all these different institutions.

And so it's quite possible that although the WHO was not doing what Trump would like, it doesn't necessarily mean it is doing the right thing either. It may well be being used or he perceives it as being used as just another agent of the people that would like to get him out of office.

(For example) “I would like to point out basically, you know, what, this insight we found today this entire disease came off of a culture from a napkin that was found in that hotel room from Trump's dossier. And that's the original source. And then they dropped that off in a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown in New York when Trump was still living in New York. And that's where this disease came from, it’s Trump's fault.”

And there are some folks probably trying to figure out that kind of a narrative or that angle and there they are because they were put there by the Clinton or Bush or, you know, some other person over the years.

So the point is still down to this one. People have to not look at the World Health Organization as if it's an honest broker. This is not this is a self-interested group like any other and is very closely aligned with the elites of Western Europe, the United States and Japan.

Secondly, Trump has to pitch this whole feud with international institutions to his base. And there's an element of that going on in there.

And finally I think that we have to also consider the possibility that whatever is happening, we're going to have to construct something entirely different to respond in the future, because no matter pointing the finger at anyone, everyone has failed thus far.

This is the 21st century. So some virus that appears either in cattle in Omaha or somewhere in room on China or wherever it came from, should not spread around the world and bring death with it without us having at least enough masks and ventilators to deal with the outcome, let alone a responsive health care system that could identify this and give us in the 21st century already vaccines and whatever solutions there are in biology because they're there. And if we don't have them yet, it's because we've been spending money on missiles and bombs and wars instead of medicine.

Sputnik: How reasonable is it to leave WHO during a critical global pandemic? How timely is this measure?

Don Debar: Well, having a feud with the World Health Organization at a different time would mean nothing. There'd be no attention paid to it. So in a way, as you know, counterintuitive as it seems, this is exactly the time to have this conversation because people are paying attention to it. And again, one has to consider not just who do people think the World Health Organization is, but what, in fact, is the World Health Organization.

Now, there was a very interesting discussion of some of these points that President Xi Jinping had on Monday at the opening of the World Health Assembly. And I suggest that people take a listen to that – it’s from 10 to 15 minutes long. And he detailed a lot of this. But now we have to we have to we should be looking at not just, you know, how is this good or bad to be doing this to the WHO right now. But what is it that we lack that we need to get? There's a larger question. So, you know, either we enhance the World Health Organization, that's fine. If we correct some of the problems or you know, or we scrap it, that's fine, too, if we put something else there. But we need to have infrastructure to deal with these kinds of things and it has to work better than this has worked so far.

Sputnik: What role does the United States play in WHO as a whole? If they come out in the end, how will this affect the organisation?

Don Debar: This is more like a business management question. If the United States is in World Health Organization, OK, and the United States is outside of World Health Organization and everything else is a constant. That's one question. And but, of course, that's not how things work in the real world. There are some functions that are performed by or through or in coordination with or under the supervision of the World Health Organization. That is possible because of the $450 million a year or whatever it is that the United States contributes to.

Presumably, if the U.S. pulled out of that, that money would no longer be available. OK. Well, that been some of those things will no longer be performed by or with the WHO. Are they things that need to be performed. What would be doing it instead? What structures would arise. You know, instead, what other regrouping is of existing structures? How would people divide the labor basically, if the existing division of labor had to be scrapped because the US pulled out of the World Health Organization, or alternatively, if the U.S. pulls out and nothing changes then good, here's $450 million, we'll spend it on something else. Just go buy some penicillin or Band-Aids or whatever.

And you have to look at the whole picture to answer to that question. And I don't think we have a picture of the whole picture yet. I think that what this pandemic, if nothing else, has shown us, there are huge holes in the global health system if there can even be one worthy of that name. You know, like a unitary human health system. And I think the questions ought to be, what do we need as a species to survive? What resources are available realistically that we can apply to that and how can we organize them?

And then you come to the big question - by what process do we make these determinations that achieve this? I think we need to get on it, though, because we're living closer and closer to each other. It’s more and more crowded. there's more and more cross contamination of societies. You go from China today to Manhattan and suddenly people are sneezing two days later, then somebody gets on a plane from San Francisco and goes to Beijing. You know, people in Wuhan are bleeding out of their eyes or something and we’re all living closer together and there’s questions over infrastructure and environment and we’re going to be facing these kind of crises more and more and it’s a crapshoot whether one of them comes through that has a 100% fatality rate or not before we get to dealing with it. So what are we spending money on right now that we could be spending money on to prevent that from happening instead?

© REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque U.S. President Donald Trump addresses the daily coronavirus task force briefing at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 7, 2020

Sputnik: The United States under Donald Trump has the image of a country that has unilaterally withdrawn from many important treaties. How will this exit affect the image of the country and Trump himself?

Don Debar: As somebody that comes out of a business that is transactional in nature, real estate. That stuff is basically you're sitting down and making dealmaking all the time. Transactional. Yeah. So what do you see? See an agreement for the first time that's been made by somebody else is, you know, what are the costs and benefits of this and can we get a better deal? And so he has and this, you know, he speaks in those terms, even when he looks at these things, the deal with Iran, we can get a better deal.

The deal was on the table with North Korea. We'll get a better deal. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Better deal. Better deal than the nuclear nonproliferation treaty reduction, whatever they need. Several things that they scrapped.

By the way, George Bush scrapped up the more important ones than what Trump scrapped.

You know, optics of this, all of that. And now would he be walking away from or renegotiating? And then what's his image? What image is he projecting? There are some agreements I would love to see him walk away from that he sort of threatened to do when he was running for office and got my attention. We're talking here about scrapping NATO, for example, looking at the military alliances in general and say, do we really need these in the 21st century? There's no longer a massive threat of a world war. We don't really have any big enemies. Do we need to be wasting all this money on all this stuff?

Now, he had to revise that, but not fundamentally as he started to implement different things. Also, the newspapers are calling him a traitor. They're calling him an isolationist and all of this. So he sort of skated that way and actually spent more money on the military budgets than the others, although I think he sees them and he speaks of them as jobs bills.

“I'm not allowed to spend money any other place, but on weapons fine, buy weapons, at least somebody is going to get work.”

But there's some other agreements that I'd like to see him walk away from. The JCPOA, I think. I don't think was a catastrophe that everybody makes it out to be except the catastrophe is that the sanctions have continued. But a long story short, as far as that goes, the agreements that he has abrogated, NAFTA, that he renegotiated - the ongoing negotiations with China over trade…walking away from the TPP, a lot of those I think a lot of people were in favor of. And in fact, they are some of the reasons that he got elected. Those are not things that are popular with you know, the people who were the political elite for the 40 years prior to Trump but these are things that were popular with voters. Now they're not popular with the media. So the image that comes out of this is that he's just a wrecker.

If you come in there and you have a marriage, he’ll wreck that. If you have a partnership on a little grocery store he’ll wreck that, he's just a, you know, crazy anarchistic maniac. And if you have an agreement, he's going to break it. But that's an image that's being sold for in the media. It's because of the ongoing media antipathy towards him. But and also by a lot of the players. Iran, for example, should, you know, be angry with Trump and criticize Trump over him abrogating their agreement because they are actually materially suffering from sanctions that Trump and the U.S. government have put on. Although, you know, I point out that Congress passed sanctions against Iran all by itself without Trump and against Russia and North Korea, if we go back to 2017, 2018.

But between the thing itself, which is the abrogation of treaties and the image, I think there's a big difference. A lot of the things that he has renegotiated or abrogated should have been - not all, but some certainly a lot of them, like TPP.

And the image, however, is something is being crafted by a third party, by the media and by, you know, just people that are on the other side of the table around the world. And that is what it is. It's an image. It’s maybe the honest perception of some and a fair one. And for others, it's one, you know, is being peddled just like every other image that’s being peddled.

Google & Apple COVID-Tracing Tech Sparks Security Concerns,https://cdn2.img.sputniknews.com/images/107938/79/1079387949.jpg,"Rival tech giants Google and Apple have now come together to release long-anticipated software that will help states build phone apps to trace an individual’s exposure to coronavirus. However, there are many things at stake in this initiative.

A number of state officials from North Dakota, South Carolina and Alabama publicly praised an unprecedented collaboration between Google and Apple that will help them produce a contact-tracing app automatically notifying people whether they have spent time near someone who tested positive for COVID-19.

These US states and some countries have already signalled that they will be willing to use the app, while France, Norway and India have remained sceptical regarding the initiative, giving preference to a more centralised approach, that allows the storing up and uploading of data via Bluetooth to a remote server, thus allegedly making it easier for health authorities to contain the virus.

So far, the UK’s NHS has been developing a contact tracing app built exactly using this approach, despite breach of privacy concerns and the possibility that this data will b overshared with the government. According to some reports, Britain is now also eyeing the integration of an Apple-Google API model to their app, but some fear that even a decentralised approach propelled by these two giants may not be as safe as initially suggested.

“It is possible this technology may be abused to collect more information other than data related to the virus,” says Fow Chee Kang, associate director and cyber security managing consultant at LGMS. “Although the statement released by the tech giants highlights the features of protecting user privacy and security, nevertheless, there are still possibilities of using such technology in conjunction with existing data that is already in the mobile device to profile the user.”

The companies have indeed stated that the version of their COVID-tracing app would protect its users with the help of encryption, and lack a centralised database, with the process being carried out only through the phones themselves, which would prevent the unnecessary storage of private information. However, following several scandals involving Google over potential breaches of privacy, the company has openly stated its cooperation with the White House “may negatively impact the trust of users” toward Apple as well, says Kang.

“It is certain that there will be data being shared to the government about its user, hence, it may affect the trust of Apple customers in this sense,” the expert notes.

According to Matthew Hickey, cyber security expert and co-founder of Hacker House, contact tracing applications as such “have been disputed by many as an unnecessary invasion of privacy,” as he argues that even the creators of NHS’s app “have expressly stated that they wish to retain the collected data after the pandemic ends for future study”.

“This opens up the prospect that this data could also be abused in the future and will make it easier for similar track and trace programs to be implemented by governments around the world,” Hickey argues. “It is my opinion that we should not sacrifice our personal privacy and liberty for a small amount of security from a Virus threat.”

There still might be an option for those users who are “concerned about the privacy and security of any information collected from smartphone tracing apps”, says associate professor at the School of Engineering at RMIT Mark A Gregory, which is “to factory reset their phones after the pandemic.” He does not specify, however, how to go about information that has already been collected by Google and Apple about its users.

Westminster is introducing the quarantine measures to in a bid to clamp down on the spread of the coronavirus in the UK. A contact tracing app is also being trialled in the Isle of Wight and will be deployed throughout the country in June, should it prove successful.

But has Westminster botched its handling of the coronavirus Pandemic? UKIP Wales Leader Neil Hamilton gave his views on the matter.

Sputnik: Should Westminster have implemented compulsory quarantines for new arrivals into the UK earlier?

Neil Hamilton: Of course, this should have been done right at the very start, it is one thing that as an island, we should be able to guarantee that we are able to control. There are loads of mistakes that have been made by this government since the start of the crisis, and that’s probably the biggest one of the lot.

We’ve still got people arriving in their thousands every day, we don’t know who they are, and there are ones arriving in small boats from across the Channel for example, who are seemingly welcomed with open arms instead of being sent straight back, so it is bizarre.

It’s a complete failure of the government, they have put the country under house arrest virtually, but yet it’s virtually an open door to all comers from around the world if they can get here.

Sputnik: Could Boris Johnson be forced to resign as British Prime Minister if it is deemed that his government has failed to adequately protect public health during the coronavirus pandemic?

Neil Hamilton: It’s the fault of the entire political class; it’s not just Boris Johnson. Yet again, the whole of the political establishment has fallen down on the job, the Labour Party wouldn’t have introduced a quarantine, they want more and more immigrants to come to this country because it adds to the pool of potential voters for their party in the future.

There is no point in looking at either them or the Liberal Democrats, who are crazy globalists as well, so it is a failure of government, and all potential governments at all levels as well, actually. The political system has failed us here in the same way as it failed us for decades over the EU, conventional wisdom isn’t wisdom at all.

Sputnik: Are you in favour of contact tracing?

I think that testing and tracing is something that we should have been doing from the start, but this is a case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted, we know that there is a portion of the population which is vulnerable, but there is almost nobody who is under sixty who has contracted coronavirus and suffered very badly from it, and it is only those with underlying health conditions, who are of any serious risk of dying.

What they should do is target the vulnerable part of the population, and the people connecting with them, whereas this contact tracing is going to apply to the entire population of the country if it is rolled out beyond the Isle of Wight.

There are massive invasions of privacy, and of people’s personal liberty. We are paying far too high a price for the control of an epidemic, which in historical terms; is actually pretty minor.

Iraq's security forces said Wednesday they had nabbed Abdul Nasser Qardash, the man who allegedly replaced Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The self-styled first 'Caliph' of Daesh* (ISIS/ISIL) was reportedly killed as a result of a US raid on his hideout, where he supposedly blew himself up after being chased into a dead-end tunnel in northwestern Syria last October.

Although in 2017 Iraq declared that it had managed to eradicate the presence of Daesh in the country, recent months saw a surge in the terrorists' activity. Several days ago, the terrorist group, which became infamous for its public executions, beheadings, slavery, and torture techniques – had killed at least three people in two separate attacks in the country's eastern Diyala province. Authorities said two security officers had been killed and two others wounded amid clashes with the militants, who also kidnapped and murdered a civilian.

Using Every Opportunity

Ahmed Rushdi, senior foreign policy advisor to the Iraqi Parliament, says their 'resurgence' was triggered by the spread of the coronavirus, that had forced the authorities to consolidate all their efforts into the fight against the diseases that has already claimed the lives of more than 130 people.

""The country's security forces were sent into cities to supervise and manage the lockdown imposed on them by the government; and that gave Daesh the ability to manoeuvre.""

But the pandemic hasn't been the only factor that contributed to their comeback. Before the approval of the new government in the beginning of May, Iraq has been mired in a political crisis that led to the resignation of former prime minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, who has been accused by the masses of driving the country into an economic abyss.

The World Bank has already warned that Iraq's fiscal situation didn't show any signs of improvement, whereas the country's unemployment rate is expected to climb in 2020, reaching 8 percent, a 0.2 increase from the previous year.

In addition, Iraq has failed to tackle the growing problem of its one and a half million internally displaced persons and the amount of those living below the poverty line, with a United Nations report suggesting that by the end of the year the number of those who are in need of assistance would reach 40 percent.

Daesh, which has been observing the developments closely, knew to use Iraq's economic woes and its political turbulence to promote their own agenda, namely driving the Iraqi forces out and re-establishing control over the areas it had lost, said Rushdi.

""They are careful not to target Sunni areas. Quite the opposite is true: they come to Sunni-dominated neighbourhoods and promise to support and protect them from the Iraqi government's corruption and instability. While not many people are taken by their promises, a lot of people are frustrated at the government's inability to tackle the nation's economic problems.""

Similar tactics have been used by Daesh in the past, when the group capitalised on the frustration of the Sunni minority, with the government dominated by Shiites, prompting some to cooperate with the terrorists.

Divided We Stand?

Back then, it was the joint efforts of the US-led coalition, coupled with the assistance of Iran, the Iraqi army, the Kurdish Perhmarga and the country's Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU) that eventually brought Daesh to its knees. Now, however, that might be a difficult target to reach.

""Unlike Daesh, our security forces are not that well trained. Nor do they have the necessary equipment to withstand the militants,"" explained Rushdi.

To make matters worse, the Iraqi security forces have also been largely divided, taking orders from different high-ranking officials within the Iraqi government. The army, for example, that boasts some 300 thousand military personnel, is answering to the Minister of Defence, whereas the Popular Mobilisation Units (PMUs) that comprise some 200 thousand members are reporting directly to the prime minister.

""The fact that the previous government has soured relations with the US hasn't helped us either,"" said Rushdi, referring to the demands made by the former PM calling on Washington to pull out its troops from the country, following the assassination of one of Iran's top military commanders, Qasem Soleimani, in early January.

""The result was that we have lost the assistance of the coalition as well as their air support and that inevitably led to losses on the ground,"" he explained.

That, however, is set to change, believes Rushdi. ""The new premier [Mustafa Al Kadhimi] is said to be supported by the US and chances are high that he will be able to appease the Americans and that will eventually help Iraq to curb the spread of Daesh"".

Fake ID papers used by Nazi SS leader Heinrich Himmler in an attempt to flee Germany in May 1945 have been donated to the Military Intelligence Museum in the UK town of Shefford, the BBC reports.

The documents, which were unearthed 75 years after Himmler’s death, have recently been handed over to the museum by the great niece of Lieutenant-Colonel Sidney Noakes, a lawyer who joined the UK Intelligence Corps in 1943.

The papers are expected to be put on display after the planned reopening of the museum, which was closed due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Himmler used the fake documents, which identified him as Sergeant Heinrich Hizinger, as he planned to hide out in northern Germany’s Harz Mountains following Adolf Hitler’s suicide and the subsequent unconditional surrender of the country in World War Two.

On 22 May 1945, Himmler and his two companions were arrested after an Allied patrol asked for their identity papers, which carried an official stamp used by SS members in a bid to flee Germany.

The three men were then sent to a detention camp, where Himmler revealed his real identity and was then reportedly given a “gentle interrogation” by the British security service MI5; shortly after, the SS head committed suicide by swallowing a cyanide capsule.

Bill Steadman, curator of the Military Intelligence Museum, has meanwhile been cited by the Daily Mail as saying that “without this damning stamp on the document it is possible that Himmler may have been able to pass through the system unnoticed, and escape as did many other wanted Nazis”.

As one of the masterminds of the Holocaust, Himmler oversaw the implementation of the so-called “Final Solution”, a plan for the genocide of all European Jews.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

Billionaire investor George Soros has reiterated his recent warning about the European Union’s possible fate, warning that the bloc could die from the economic calamity brought on by the coronavirus crisis unless it began issuing bonds to assist its weakest members.

“If the EU is unable to consider it now, it may not be able to survive the challenges it currently confronts,” Soros said in an email to reporters, his remarks cited by Reuters. “This is not a theoretical possibility; it may be the tragic reality,” he stressed.

According to the investor, issuing bonds to help countries would require Brussels to maintain a AAA credit rating, meaning the need to authorize new taxes to cover the bonds’ cost. “The taxes only have to be authorized; they don’t need to be implemented,” he insisted.

Soros also expanded on a subject he discussed at length last week – the German Constitutional Court’s ruling that the European Central Bank had overstepped its mandate with the purchase of government debt under its quantitative easing (i.e. cash printing) programme. The German court gave the bank a three-month ultimatum to justify the proportionality of the bond purchases, and warned that the Bundesbank would drop out of the programme if a solution was not found. In an unprecedented response, the European Commission threatened to sue Berlin.

In his remarks Friday, Soros suggested that “the relaxation of state aid rules, which favour Germany, has been particularly unfair to Italy, which was already the sick man of Europe and then the hardest hit by COVID-19.”

According to Soros, if Italy drops out of the EU, it might be the beginning of the end for the bloc. “What would be left of Europe without Italy?” he asked.

Soros isn’t alone in his concerns about the EU’s weak performance in the face of the coronavirus crisis. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Brussels’ failure to “mount a joint fiscal defence” against the coronavirus and the “lack of a cohesive fiscal policy” have already made the euro one of the weakest major Western currencies, sparking fresh fears about the bloc’s future.

Soros, the Hungarian-American hedge fund manager-turned activist, has been a vocal proponent of the European Union project since the 1990s. In the UK, he’s best known for sparking the 1992 run on the pound, which earned him his first billion dollar earning, but cost the British economy billions in losses. In 2002, he was convicted of insider trading in France. Elsewhere, he’s faced criticism for spending billions of dollars spreading his vision of a global, liberal, market-driven world order. He began his political activities in Eastern Europe in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Since then, his Open Societies Foundations have spread to over 60 countries, including not just developing nations, but the US and Western Europe as well.

Swedish police and social services have sounded the alarm over a new phenomenon: young people selling themselves to make ends meet after admittedly having lost their jobs due to the Covid-19 epidemic.

“Their parents also spoke about this. We are talking low-paying jobs, such as fast-food restaurants,” Malin Andersson, Secretary of Social Affairs for the Stockholm City Youth Rapid Response Team, told the newspaper Dagens Nyheter.

During the recent Operation Cod that targeted sex buyers in Stockholm, the police identified at least five people below the age of 18 who provided sexual services for money. Their sex ads said “Lost my extra job”, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reported.

“We clearly see increased activity among young people,” Detective Inspector Simon Häggström told Svenska Dagbladet. “They themselves say this is due to corona, that they have no job, and that they just sit at home. It is definitely a new group of young people making their debut now. It's alarming,” Häggström added.

Andersson said that some young people have been feeling unwell psychologically, and this trend only worsened while the schools were closed.

“They feel isolated. If a person falls into this sphere, usually there are some reasons. Everyone there feels bad, due to different circumstances. We can talk about previous traumas due to which one now feels completely alone, estranged from others,” Malin Andersson explained.

According to the social services, most young people started with sites for “sugar dating”, where wealthy adults seek out younger partners for money.

“This implies a very big risk. People who are interested in children have already crossed the threshold, they don’t care what the child thinks. Also, they are very good at persuading,” Andersson said.

When the police and social services identify sex workers who are younger than 18, they are taken home to their parents and offered help and support.

“Now we see more active male users on sugar dating sites, and young people are more likely to post ads offering sexual services. All this is very serious, as we know: very often this kind of arrangement is a direct gateway to prostitution,” Stockholm City social affairs councillor Jan Jönsson said, pledging to address the matter.

Sweden's present-day legislation on prostitution make it illegal to buy sex, but not to sell it. Pimping and operating brothers is also illegal. It was Sweden that pioneered the criminalisation of the purchase, but not the selling of sex back in 1999. Since then the Nordic model has spread to other nations, including Canada and Ireland.

With 32,172 confirmed Covid-19 cases and close to 3,900 deaths, Sweden is the worst-hit Scandinavian nation.

A senior MP has described it as thing that “should not be repeated”.

The Finnish Parliament’s foreign affairs and defence committees plan to voice their displeasure over key information about their country's cooperation with Sweden and NATO being withheld from them, national broadcaster Yle reported.

The committee members claim they were kept in the dark about an agreement drawn up between Finland, Sweden and NATO in 2018 which boosted information exchange and dialogue in crisis situations, despite the fact that foreign and security policy matters, as well as military cooperation are within their respective committees' jurisdiction.

According to the agreement, which in government circles has been referred to as an “arrangement”, Finland, Sweden and NATO can separately agree to increased information exchange and dialogue in times of crises, Yle reported. The country holding the information or the military alliance would be able to decide whether or not to share it.

However, despite the arrangement being agreed upon in 2018, neither committee found out about it until February of this year. According to Yle's informed sources, its terms had never previously been disclosed to MPs and even the very existence of the arrangement had not been previously publicised. The arrangement was reportedly classified as “secret” by NATO and was assigned the highest security classification in Finland.

A Yle source described withholding information from the committees as a serious matter. In effect, parliament did not know everything that Finland was committed to.

When the arrangement was concluded, Timo Soini was Foreign Minister and Jussi Niinistö was Defence Minister. Since then, Soini has quit politics, whereas Niinistö has switched parties. The then-government led by former ex-Centre Party leader Juha Sipilä was privy to the arrangement, as was the current government led by Sanna Marin of the Social Democrats.

Both committees have yet to evaluate the implications of the arrangement in political and military terms. The analysis has been slowed down by the novel coronavirus epidemic . However, the committees say they are planning a joint statement to the Constitutional Law Committee on Parliament’s right of access to information.

One anonymous source described the arrangement as “harmless” and underlined “mutual benefits”. Another one ventured it was not as significant as the Host Nation agreement, which lays the foundation for technical compatibility in case Finland receives NATO troops during drills or in crisis situations.

Nevertheless, former Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja, deputy chair of the foreign affairs committee, hinted at his displeasure in a Facebook post. While calling the overall performance “commendable”, he said there was a “more serious case that should not be repeated”.

Finland and Sweden, while formally non-aligned, have both in recent years been drawn closer to NATO, having stepped up cooperation with the US as well. Pundits described this peculiar state as “post-neutral” and “pre-allied”.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

The European Union may start offering financial support to companies hard hit by coronavirus that are not able to receive financial assistance from their home governments, EU Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni told Handelsblatt.

“This is important for pan-European value chains, for example in the car industry. If one link fails there, all the others are affected,” said the official, who also served as Italian prime minister from 2016 to 2018.

The measure would come as an additional instrument to the existing reconstruction plan that will be presented next week, the commissioner noted. On Monday, the EU’s two biggest economies, France and Germany, proposed to establish a 500-billion-euro Recovery Fund that would help corona-hit industries with financial grants. Some EU states, including Germany, believe that this support should come under the condition that its recipients, such as Italy, would first implement certain reforms. Former Italian PM Gentiloni, however, said during the interview that he did not believe that there was any “conditionality” around the financial assistance.

The emergency plan may turn out to be much more costly in the end, according to recent reports. It has been criticised by certain EU members in the north, including Austria, whose chancellor has recently argued that the most corona-affected countries should be helped by “loans” rather than simple grants.

The two-country initiative was still welcomed by many EU nationals and officials, including President of the European Council Charles Michel, but many social media users and tax payers remained sceptical regarding the proposal.

​The collection is being sold by East Bristol Auction and is expected to fetch thousands of pounds.

“This was real espionage work - secret meetings, coded messages, real cloak-and-dagger stuff. A big part of the SOE was sending secret items to troops in occupied territories. Useful items like maps, compasses and even secret orders - anything to help them escape or evade capture. Very often these items were 'everyday' items that were sent in aid packages to camps, and the way items were secreted was very often ingenious. German prison camp officials wouldn't think twice that an innocent set of dominos could do harm, but how wrong they were. You can almost picture some RAF officers in their hut pulling apart these dominos and planning their escape. It's incredible stuff, both frightening and exhilarating at the same time,” says auctioneer Andrew Stowe.

Piers Morgan has “banned all cabinet ministers” from appearing on his show, Good Morning Britain (GMB), following news that Dominic Cummings, a senior adviser to Boris Johnson, allegedly breached the government’s coronavirus lockdown rules.

Making the announcement via Twitter, Mr Morgan - well renowned for stirring controversy - said that, “due to today’s developments, I am regretfully forced to ban all cabinet ministers from appearing on Good Morning Britain.”

“Only exceptions will be those who didn’t publicly support Cummings breaching lockdown,” the TV personality added.

Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, Morgan has been a staunch critic of the government’s response, describing it as a “shambles.”

This situation has finally sent you mad. 🥴 — Helen Hims (@helenhims) May 24, 2020

Dominic Cummings has come under heavy fire this weekend over accusations that he abandoned lockdown on two occasions to drive 260 miles from London to visit his parents in the northeastern English county of Durham. It is widely reported that Cummings made the first trip at a time when he believed he had been infected with COVID-19.

Despite apparent anger at Mr Cummings’ behaviour among Brits, a number of government ministers came out to defend him before his second breaching of the lockdown was revealed by The Mirror and The Observer.

The Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, has said accusations that Mr Cummings “travelled backwards and forwards” are “completely untrue,” and that since returning to London from his first trip on April 14, he has stayed in the capital.

“I certainly know that the first one you mention, of travelling back up (to Durham), I know that is not true,” Mr Shapps told Sky News’ Sophie Ridge on Sunday, adding that Cummings is a “stickler for the rules.”

Mr Shapps said that Cummings was “trying to do his best” for his four-year-old son who was “in danger of having both his parents fall ill,” and therefore Mr Cummings took, “perfectly sensible and rational steps.”

In his own defence, Cummings said to the media that, “I behaved reasonably and legally… it’s a question of doing the right thing, it’s not about what you guys think.”

Despite reportedly pledging his “full support” to Mr Cummings, and refusing to throw him “to the dogs,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson is coming under increasing pressure from his cabinet to fire the senior adviser.

Prominent pro-Brexit Conservative MP Steve Baker has said that Cummings must resign.

“Dominic Cummings must go before he does any more harm to the UK, the government, the prime minister, our institutions or the Conservative party,” Baker wrote on The Critic website.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

Business bosses have written to Boris Johnson to demand the urgent creation of ""air bridges"" to low-risk countries to prevent Britain's controversial quarantine ""risking major damage to the arteries of UK trade"".

The letter, seen by The Telegraph, urged the prime minister to act, as otherwise, the UK would be pushed ""to the back of the queue as states begin conversations for opening up their borders"" against the backdrop of the gradually easing pandemic.

It also touched upon Boris Johnson's intention to conduct thorough checks into all airport arrivals, including cargo:

""We have serious reservations about a blanket approach to all arrivals, irrespective of where passengers are originating from"", the letter, whose signatories include Airlines UK, the Federation of Small Businesses, Make UK, UKHospitality, and the British Chambers of Commerce, asserts.

Such a line of action, it warns, would adversely affect tourism, hospitality, and other business sectors that rely heavily on air travel.

""Air bridges to low or no-infection countries could be a vital step towards allowing British businesses to maintain connectivity as part of a sensible, risk-based measure"", the letter suggests.

The concept is believed to have the backing of Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. But sources said officials in the Foreign Office and Department of Health were opposed due to concerns that Britain could import new outbreaks of coronavirus, despite assurances that the countries in question have battled the coronavirus.

The split over air bridges comes as a senior transport official reportedly issued an edict to airline leaders last week telling them not to publicly denounce the Johnson-declared travel quarantine. Michael O'Leary, the Ryanair chief executive, jumped at the chance to rip the plans.

""It is bonkers. It has no credibility"", he said, suggesting that Johnson could be ""blurting out something on quarantines, and they have to make it up as they go along afterwards"".

He also assumed the air travel limitations would be soon scrapped whatever the case, as most European countries ""will have already lifted"" them by early June.

A new report by the Mirror claims that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, who was confirmed to be struggling with the COVID-19 disease, defied COVID-19 lockdown restrictions for the second time, after he was identified in Houghall Woods, Durham, two weeks after reports of his first trip to the town.

Cummings, said to have traveled to visit his parents, was spotted on Sunday 19 April at a local beauty salon in Houghall Woods, according to the report. He commented to people passing by saying, “Aren’t the bluebells lovely?”

In response to the report, Johnson's office said they would not “waste our time” answering “inaccurate reporting” by the Mirror and the Guardian newspapers on the UK PM's senior aide.

“Yesterday the Mirror and Guardian wrote inaccurate stories about Mr Cummings. Today they are writing more inaccurate stories including claims that Mr Cummings returned to Durham after returning to work in Downing Street on 14 April.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has hailed the ""100% accurate"" test as a ""game-changer"" for lifting lockdown restrictions.

Someone can be re-infected with coronavirus within six months, research suggests, in a development that will crush advocates for ""immunity passports"", which theoretically allow bearers to demonstrate they’ve recovered from the illness.

Between 1985 and 2020, University of Amsterdam researchers tested 10 men for four types of coronaviruses which cause the common cold at either three month or six month intervals. Most participants - aged 27 - 66 - caught the viruses again within three years, with the study concluding ""coronavirus protective immunity is short-lasting"" and high antibody levels ""were never sustained at the next visit"".

""We saw frequent reinfection after 12 months post infection and substantial reduction in antibody levels as soon as six months post-infection. It was recently suggested that recovered individuals should receive a so-called 'immunity passport' which would allow them to relax social distancing measures and provide governments with data on herd immunity levels in the population. However, as protective immunity may be lost by six months post-infection, the prospect of reaching functional herd immunity by natural infection seems very unlikely,” the study states.

A study at the University of Amsterdam found that those who survived the coronavirus could become reinfected within six months https://t.co/MuRZNA69IB — Faytuks News 🔴 (@Faytuks) May 23, 2020

​In other words, the conclusion casts doubt on the reliability of so-called ""immunity passports"", which would be issued to people who’ve already overcome COVID-19 infection and test positive for antibodies, and is based on the assumption they’re immune as a result.

The World Health Organisation has previously urged governments not to use ""immunity passports"" for easing lockdown simply because they have antibodies for COVID-19 - nonetheless, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced plans for antibody certificates 21st May, on the basis of results of research which showed at least five percent of people in the UK have now developed COVID-19 antibodies and at least 17 percent of Londoners have them. Hancock further announced the NHS will roll out coronavirus antibody tests following agreements between Whitehall and pharmaceutical firms Roche and Abbott, starting with health care workers, patients and care home residents as of week commencing 1st June. It could take up to 28 days after infection before the test can confirm if a person has or has had the virus.

John Edmunds, professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, has previously warned studies of other coronaviruses suggest ""potentially bad news"" for hopes of immunity to the virus being developed in humans on a long-term basis.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

""I can tell you that the PM provides Mr Cummings with his full support"", Mr Shapps said.

Earlier, The Guardian and the Daily Mirror published a joint investigation which revealed that Cummings took a trip to his parents' house in Durham just a day after he confirmed that he had been self-isolating with COVID-19 symptoms.

Following the report, the British government issued a statement saying that Cummings did not break coronavirus lockdown guidelines when he took the journey as he made it to ensure that his young son could be properly cared for.

Following the incident, Mr Cummings has faced backlash and calls for resignation, but answering questions from reporters, the prime minister's right hand said that he will ""obviously not"" step down.

""You guys are probably all about as right about that as you were about Brexit: do you remember how right you all were about that?"" Cummings said.

UK Labour Party Calls for Inquiry Into Cummings' Lockdown Trip

Meanwhile, the UK's opposition Labour Party has called for an urgent inquiry into Cummings' reported lockdown trip.

""The British people have made important and painful sacrifices to support the national effort, including being away from family in times of need. It is therefore vital that the government can reassure the public that its most senior figures have been adhering to the same rules as everyone else"", Rachel Reeves, Labour's cabinet office minister in waiting, stated.

Previously, after the report of the incident emerged, it gave the opposition a handle to call on Johnson to sack Cummings, saying that the lockdown rules made it clear that those with suspected COVID-19 symptoms should isolate with their whole household.

EU leaders have responded with frustration to the UK’s plan for a quarantine regime that will require arrivals in the country to self-isolate for 14 days.

UK Home Secretary Priti Patel revealed on Friday that anyone arriving in the UK - including nationals returning from holidays abroad - from June 8 would be required under UK law to stay at home for 14 days or risk being hit with fines of £1,000.

France has responded by saying that it “regretted” the UK’s decision and will impose a “reciprocal measure.” It was initially reported that France and other EU countries could be exempt from any UK quarantine regime, however it was confirmed this week that would not be the case.

A spokesman for France’s Interior Ministry has been widely quoted as saying that, “we take note of the British government’s decision and we regret it. France is ready to put in place a reciprocal measure as soon as the system comes into force on the British side.”

Italy, once Europe’s Coronavirus capital, has also called for the UK to reconsider its position and said that together with the EU it should strike a “coordinated approach” to lifting lockdowns.

Raffaele Trombetta, the Italian Ambassador to the UK seemed to take a jab at Britain’s go it alone approach in an interview with the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, saying that, “we believe that this pandemic is a global problem so the best thing to do is to tackle it with a coordinated approach.”

Mr Trombetta highlighted Italy’s plan to lift quarantine rules for those arriving from the UK to the EU as of June 3.

“We had 40 million trips from the UK to Italy last year. We know how much they love Italy. We are still open, welcoming them. We have made it clear what we are going to do and it’s important for British people to know that they can come to Italy. We understand that the UK’s new rules will be assessed after three weeks so hopefully there will be an easing of the measures as we are doing in Italy.”

Priti Patel announced the stringent new UK measures during the daily Coronavirus press conference in Downing Street on Friday, May 22.

“We are following the science and introducing public health measures that are supported by SAGE. This will require international arrivals to self-isolate for 14 days – that is the incubation period of the virus so that if people have become infected overseas, we can limit the spread of the virus at home,” Patel said.

“And as we are taking this action, we are taking it at a time when it will be the most effective. Passengers arrivals have been down by 99% compared to the previous year. Now we are past the peak of this virus, we must take steps to guard against imported cases, triggering an insurgence of this deadly disease,” she added.

According to the UK Home Office, travellers will reportedly be required to provide their contact information and officials will carry out checks to ensure that individuals are complying with the new rules. Those in self-isolation will not be permitted to have visitors and should not go out to buy essentials if they are able to rely on others to do so for them. Patel also revealed a list of 39 categories of people who would be exempt from the new rules, including healthcare workers, pilots and those coming from Ireland.

The British government has said that the new measures would be reviewed every three weeks.

The travel industry has also panned the UK government’s new quarantine measures, with Ryanair, Europe’s largest airline, describing them as “unenforceable.”

“This isolation measure simply does not work unless passengers arriving in international UK airports are detained in airport terminals or hotels for the 14-day period. Once these arriving passengers have travelled on the crowded London Underground, or the Heathrow and Gatwick Express, or buses or taxis to their destination, the subsequent quarantine is pointless,” a Ryanair spokesman has been widely quoted as saying.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

Boris Jonhson has “lost his edge” and may have not yet fully recovered from his case of COVID-19, a senior Tory MP has warned in an interview with The Daily Mail.

The Tory MP reportedly said that in “normal” times, Mr Johnson would have been resting up for longer and taking a slower approach to returning to work after battling with a life-threatening disease.

“Under normal circumstances he [Johnson] would probably have been taking it easier. The guy was close to death… there was pressure on him to come back. People don’t usually come back to the pressure that he has been under. He is back in the firing line, running UK plc with 67 million people and all the problems that he has got.”

The MP, who spoke anonymously, then went on to suggest that there are concerns being raised from within the Conservative Party about the prime minister’s mental stability following his reportedly gruelling battle with COVID-19.

“Boris has lost that edge. You could say Boris, we need you to take a really difficult turn, and he would use his common sense and get out of it. The illness may have had an impact. The spontaneity… I wonder whether mentally he’s not as sharp because he’s been seriously ill,” the MP added.

The comment comes amidst a steady barrage of criticism against the government over its response to the coronavirus outbreak. Particularly, the high rate of deaths in elderly care homes across the UK and the apparent decision to abandon mass testing early on in the pandemic. Critics have also panned the slow establishment of a new testing regime.

Damningly, Nobel Prize-winning scientist Sir Paul Nurse has slammed the UK political establishment over what he characterised as an absence of leadership throughout the crisis by saying that, “the question I’m constantly asking myself is: who is actually in charge of the decisions? Who is developing the strategy and the operation and implementation of that strategy?”

He told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Friday, May 22, that, “I get a sense the UK has been rather too much on the back foot, increasingly playing catch-up, firefighting us through successive crises.”

Yet, it’s not only Boris Johnson’s leadership that the senior Tory MP expressed concern about to The Mail.

The recently elected Labour Party leader, Sir Keir Starmer, is also a growing cause of concern for Tories who see him as a formidable opponent in parliament.

The senior Tory MP told The Mail that, following a string of well-received performances from Starmer in which he forensically questioned the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, “it is going down well. We need to be careful. Keir is a savvy guy. He can think on his feet.”

While Downing Street hasn't yet commented on the said investigation, speculation is running high over its staffer's political future, as well as general credibility bearing in mind that he is said to have been personally behind the counter-COVID measures.

""Following the news that Dominic Cummings travelled from London to Durham during lockdown and his behaviour was investigated by the police, his position is completely untenable - he must resign or be sacked"", SNP Westminster Leader Ian Blackford said.

In a series of tweets, Mr Blackford said: ""This is a key test of leadership for Boris Johnson. People must have confidence that the Tory government is following its own rules - not being investigated by the police for breaking them"", going on to state that millions would find it ""completely incredible that Boris Johnson's most senior adviser has been breaking his own government's rules"".

Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey echoed the stance, suggesting that the way out is crystal clear: ""If Dominic Cummings has broken the lockdown guidelines he will have to resign"".

""One law for them another for the rest"", Labour MP Angela Eagle tweeted, while her colleague delved into greater detail pointing out:

""So we can now take children from a household where people have tested positive to stay with the likely over 70s? Missed that exemption in the guidance"", she fumed.

Piers Morgan, in his typically fiery manner, called for Johnson to take countermeasures:

""Fire him tonight prime minister - or why should anybody heed your lockdown rules?"", he asked, before going on:

""Boris Johnson must have known where Cummings was self-isolating. Why did you let your chief adviser break your lockdown rules, prime minister?""

The Daily Mail, meanwhile, has cited Cummings’ ""close friend"" as saying that he couldn't be bothered less with the reports:

""It's more fake news from The Guardian. There is zero chance of him resigning"", the friend concluded.

The newspaper reports suggest, citing sources that, Johnson's right-hand man was questioned by the Durham Constabulary on 31 March after travelling to where his parents reside, which is over 200 miles from his London home, just a day after he was seen in Westminster with a Downing Street spokesperson confirming he had been self-isolating with coronavirus symptoms. Sources assumed that the 48-year-old Number 10 staffer made the long trip to the North East so his parents could take care of his young son if he and his wife, who were both displaying symptoms, were unable to look after him - something the couple reportedly believed was not prohibited under the new rules.

The police reportedly investigated the matter and found the said individual was staying in ""part of a house"" at a Durham address, and in line with national policing guidance, ""officers explained to the family the arrangements around self-isolation guidelines and reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel"".

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is planning to reduce the involvement of Chinese telecommunication company Huawei in the country’s 5G network rollout, according to the Daily Telegraph.

The move comes alongside plans by the United Kingdom to end its reliance on the eastern Asian country for strategic imports, including medical supplies, amid the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

“He [Johnson] still wants a relationship with China but the Huawei deal is going to be significantly scaled back. Officials have been instructed to come up with a plan to reduce Huawei’s involvement as quickly as possible,” a source said, cited by the newspaper.

Johnson is reportedly intending to scale down China’s involvement in UK infrastructure to zero by 2023, according to the newspaper.

Downing Street has declined to comment on the report, according to Reuters. Huawei has not replied to a comment request by the outlet.

The report comes ahead of the prime minister’s scheduled June visit to the US for the G7 summit, according to the Telegraph.

Cutting Huawei’s involvement in the UK's 5G rollout is also considered a step toward boosting post-Brexit trade talks with the Trump administration, which has consistently accused Beijing of being responsible for the coronavirus pandemic.

On Friday, The Times reported that Johnson had ordered Downing Street officials to prepare a plan to put an end to the country’s reliance on China for key goods. Two working groups, headed by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, have been formed to carry out this job.

The aim of the effort, codenamed ""Project Defend"", is said to pinpoint Britain’s main economic weaknesses and adopt measures that prevent attempts by “potentially hostile” foreign nation's to use those apparent weaknesses to their own advantage.

London has defied significant pressure from Washington after previously announcing that the UK would, with conditions, allow Chinese telecom giant Huawei to assist in the implementation of a 5G network in the nation.

The UK government said that the Chinese company, which has been accused by the US of providing back-door access to Chinese intelligence services, would be excluded from certain “safety-related” and “safety-critical” networks.

Washington has repeatedly warned London that permitting Huawei to take part in developing the country’s 5G network would put the US-UK intelligence-sharing agreements at risk.

In May 2019, the Trump administration blacklisted Huawei over allegations that the company's hardware and software connections sent data to Chinese intelligence agencies, amid trade tensions between the two economic powers that began in January 2018.

Beijing has repeatedly denied the accusations.

The US has also urged other countries to refrain from using Huawei equipment when adopting 5G network technology, as part of its pressure campaign on the Chinese tech corporation.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

Since the 1970s, the Ebola virus has been killing thousands of people, primarily in Africa. Despite the relatively low death toll numbers, Ebola has resulted in very high mortality rates in recent decades.

In June 1976 an unknown disease started killing people in Sudan. 151 out of 284 patients lost their lives to an illness, which at first looked like common flu. Its main symptoms included fever, sore throat, muscular pain, headache, and fatigue.

But within days the disease progressed, with patients starting to suffer from vomiting, combined with internal and external bleeding.

The agent that caused the illness was named ""Sudan virus"" and later became part of the larger Ebola virus family.

Just like many similar infectious diseases, Ebola is zoonotic in nature, meaning that it jumped from animals to humans. Its potential carriers include fruit bats – a large bat species, which are also called “flying foxes”, as well as several monkey species, gorillas and baboons.

Almost 20 years after the Sudan epidemic, Ebola re-surfaced in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, with hundreds of people falling victim to the outbreaks.

Hollywood dedicated several movies to Ebola-style epidemics, with 1995’s “Outbreak” starring Morgan Freeman and Dustin Hoffman probably the most notable. In the film, US military virologists are struggling to contain Matoba – a virus that has jumped from monkeys to humans and largely resembles Ebola.

But there are also major differences between the two. According to the “Outbreak” screenplay, Matoba, which spreads lightning-fast through a California town, is airborne, while Ebola can only be transferred from one person to another only through liquids, such as blood, saliva and sweat:

We got 19 dead, we got 100 more infected. It’s spreading like a brushfire. - What are you talking about? - If one of them has got it, then 10 of them got it now, and if one of them gets on to Cedar Creek, then we’ve got a very interesting problem!

Hollywood’s fictional Ebola strain also has something in common with the COVID19 pandemic - namely that it is highly contagious due to its transmission from person to person through the air.

The good news is that the world is unlikely to be overwhelmed by Ebola since the disease has never made it outside of Africa. So far, the current outbreak mainly affects the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the disease has claimed more than 1,300 lives within the past three years.

By contrast, Covid-19 has already spread across most countries around the world, causing border closures, flight cancellations and economic losses, which may lead to an economic crisis of unprecedented scale.

Another major difference between the two is the mortality rate. While the Ebola virus kills between 25% and 90% of its carriers, according to the World Health Organization, by March 2020 the coronavirus had an average mortality rate of just 3.4 percent.

Even though no safe and effective Ebola treatment has yet been found, it seems that victory over the deadly jungle virus is near. In August 2019, Nature magazine described two experimental drugs produced by a US pharmaceutical company as being helpful in achieving 90% survival rates among Ebola patients. If these two drugs receive formal approval, it’s possible that together with the VSV-EBOV vaccine, which was introduced in 2016, they will be able to stop Ebola completely.

In 2009-2010, more than a quarter of a million people fell victim to the swine flu – a previously unknown strain of influenza that might have infected up to 21% of the planet’s population.

As the spread of the coronavirus has accelerated worldwide, many people have discovered or re-watched movies that look strikingly similar to the 2020 real-world pandemic. In Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 film “Contagion”, several people – from an unfortunate family in the American Midwest to journalists, doctors and government officials – find themselves in the midst of the outbreak of a terrible disease that suddenly starts killing millions. Freelance journalist, portrayed by Jude Law, describes the situation:

“On day one there were two people, and then four, and then 16. In six months – it’s a billion. That’s where we’re heading”.

Sound familiar? But despite predicting in detail some aspects of the current coronavirus pandemic (you have to watch the very final moments of the film to see the most obvious clue), “Contagion” was based on the 2009 swine flu and the earlier 2002 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreaks. The film’s crew consulted a top-level virologist to make depictions of the pandemic look more realistic.

It is believed that the new H1N1 influenza strain originally “jumped” from pigs to humans in 2008. Even though some US officials believed that the virus surfaced in Asia and was brought to North America by a human carrier, later studies pointed to factory farms in Mexico as its place of origin.

The symptoms of the swine flu included fever, headache, dry cough, and a runny nose. Just like COVID-19, it was a big threat for those with underlying health complications, but unlike the coronavirus, which is known to be less dangerous to younger patients, the swine flu was much deadlier for small children and pregnant women. Its complications included pneumonia and respiratory failure, with the patients’ conditions often worsening significantly within three to five days and eventually killing them.

Doctors used a variety of treatments – from antiviral therapy to antibiotics – to treat the disease. But an effective vaccine was needed to completely thwart the pandemic.

Major pharmaceutical companies in several countries entered the race to produce and test a vaccine against the swine flu and by the end of 2009, it was commercially available.

One year after the outbreak started, the US Centres for Disease Control was encouraging people to get vaccinated. Anne Schuchat, the director of the National Centre for Immunisation and Respiratory Diseases:

“Today I’m happy to say that we have a very good supply of the H1N1 vaccine all around the country. Many people have gotten the vaccine already, many more people want to get the vaccine, and we want people to get the vaccine”.

Just like the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1920, which neither originated in nor was the worst in Spain, the swine flu wasn’t a disease that was spreading from pigs to people on a regular basis. Despite its zoonotic origin – meaning that it passed the cross-species boundary from animals to humans, it was, just like other influenza types, spread through interpersonal contacts. At one point virologists even had to explain to people that eating pork does not put them in danger of becoming infected.

At the height of the swine flu pandemic, several countries, including China, Australia, Egypt, and Japan, imposed quarantine measures to prevent the spread of the disease by checking incoming travelers or locking down ships, hotels, and other facilities where outbreaks of the swine flu were detected. These measures, however, could not be compared to the scale and seriousness of the global coronavirus restrictions that have been seen around the world in 2020.

In an interview with the Chinese news network CGTN on Saturday, Wuhan Institute of Virology Director Wang Yanyi once again rejected the Trump administration's claims that the coronavirus came from the institute's lab.

""This is pure fabrication. Our institute first received the clinical sample of the unknown pneumonia on 30 December last year"", she said, adding that after institute experts ""checked the pathogen within the sample, we found it contained a new coronavirus, which is now called SARS-CoV-2"".

""We didn't have any knowledge before that, nor had we ever encountered, researched, or kept the virus. In fact, like everyone else, we didn't even know the virus existed. How could it have leaked from our lab when we never had it?"", Wang pointed out.

She also recalled the ""current consensus of the international academic community"" on COVID-19 which suggests that ""the virus originated from wild animals"", but added ""we still don't clearly know what kind of viruses that all different wild species carry across the globe and where the viruses that are highly similar to SARS-CoV-2 are"".

""This is why cooperation between scientists all over the world is needed to find the answers. Therefore, the issue of origin-tracking is ultimately a question of science, which requires scientists to make judgments based on scientific data and facts"", Wang underscored.

Beijing Rejects Washington's Virus Origin Claims

Her remarks come as Washington continues to assert that COVID-19 came from a Wuhan biolab, with President Donald Trump claiming earlier in May that ""probably it was incompetence"" and that ""somebody was stupid"", in an apparent reference to Wuhan Institute of Virology staff.

He was echoed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who blamed China for covering up the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan and pointed to alleged ""enormous evidence"" that the coronavirus originated in a Wuhan biolab.

The allegations have consistently been rejected by the Chinese Foreign Ministry, which called on the US to ""handle its domestic affairs properly first"", rather than shift blame and the focus onto China.

The Ministry also pointed out that World Health Organisation officials have ""repeatedly stated that there is no evidence showing the virus was made in a lab"".

""Now [US officials] are again hyping up the issue of origins, insinuating that the virus had something to do with the Wuhan Institute of Virology. It's not difficult to see through their tricks which intend to muddy the waters, deflect attention, and shift the blame to others"", Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said last month.

Also in April, Yuan Zhiming, vice director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, told CGTN ""there is no way"" that the coronavirus was man-made, adding, ""we have a strict regulatory regime and code of conduct of research, so we are confident"".

""It's bad when some are deliberately trying to mislead people. […] The Washington Post and several other reporters wrote about the virus coming from the Wuhan lab. They have no evidence, or knowledge, this is entirely based on speculation"", Yuan stressed.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

The countries have also clashed over the situation in Hong Kong, as well as territorial disputes in the South China Sea, economic issues, and US dependency on Chinese resources.

""It has come to our attention that some political forces in the US are taking China-US relations hostage and pushing our two countries to the brink of a new Cold War"", Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters on Sunday.

He noted that the two nations have to find a way for peaceful coexistence, adding, however, that the issue of Hong Kong is an internal Chinese affair, and foreign meddling is unacceptable.

The minister also slammed lawsuits filed by the US states of Missouri and Mississippi against Beijing over its coronavirus response, stating they have no legal basis.

""The Chinese side has an open position regarding the scientific cooperation with the international scientific community to study the origin of the coronavirus. At the same time, we believe that this process should be professional, fair and constructive. By fair we mean that in the study of the [COVID-19] origin, political interference should be avoided"", Wang Yi said.

""Aside from the devastation caused by the novel coronavirus, there is also a political virus spreading through the US"", Wang added. ""This political virus is the use of every opportunity to attack and smear China. Some politicians completely disregard basic facts and have fabricated too many lies targeting China, and plotted too many conspiracies"".

According to him, a new security law for Hong Kong should be imposed ""without the slightest delay"".

The news comes after Beijing proposed national security legislation to ban secession and foreign interference in Hong Kong, resulting in a massive backlash in the Western media.

Apart from the coronavirus inquiry and tensions around Hong Kong, China and the US clashed on economic issues, as the American authorities criticised numerous countries for joining China's Belt and Road Initiative.

The US Senate has also recently passed a bill demanding companies confirm that they are not owned or controlled by foreign governments, which could prevent many Chinese companies from listing their shares on American exchanges.

Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump announced that Washington may completely cut off diplomatic relations with Beijing over the ongoing coronavirus crisis. He also accused the Chinese side of attempting to conceal coronavirus-related information, and claimed that he had seen evidence that COVID-19 originated at a Wuhan virology laboratory.

Beijing has vehemently dismissedd the accusations, urging the US to ""handle its domestic affairs properly first"", and adding that World Health Organisation officials have ""repeatedly stated that there is no evidence showing the virus was made in a lab"".

Philippine police have detained a man for issuing an online death threat to President Rodrigo Duterte in what has become the latest in a series of such arrests over the past several weeks.

Shortly before the detention on Tuesday, the man, who was not identified, reportedly wrote on his Facebook page, “200 million [Philippine] pesos (8.7 million dollars) to anybody who kills Duterte; bring me his head here in my barangay [village]”.

The arrest was preceded by the police in the southern province of Cebu last week detaining 26-year-old Maria Ceron for ostensibly pledging 75 million pesos (1.4 million dollars) to anyone who would do a hit job on the Philippine president.

This followed National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) agents in the Dagupan district detaining a man who allegedly offered “rewards” of 50 million pesos (more than one million dollars) to “anyone who can kill Duterte” in a proposal that they reportedly shared on social media.

The suspect was identified as Ronnel Mas, 25, a teacher at a public school in the Zambales province.

The man, who reportedly deactivated his Twitter account after the post went viral, confessed to issuing the threat, but added that “neither did he have P50 million, nor does he want to have the president killed”.

He was quoted by the media as saying that the only reason for his post was to “gain more followers and retweets”; Mas reportedly begged Duterte for forgiveness.

Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra, however, said in a statement on Wednesday that “apology is not one of the grounds for extinguishing criminal liability; I cannot feloniously injure another and get away with it by merely saying ‘sorry’”.

Mas’ arrest was followed by police in the Aklan province detaining 40-year-old construction worker Ronald Quiboyen after he allegedly said on his Facebook account that he would “double Mas’ bounty offer to kill the president”. Both men are facing cybercrime-related charges as Mas was released on bail of 72,000 pesos (over 3,000 dollars).

Commenting on the arrests, the NBI vowed that they will continue to take action “against anyone who violates the law”, while the Presidential Security Group (PSG) warned not to make online threats to anyone, including political leaders.

“Anybody can be held liable if he threatens to harm or kill a person, what more if the one that is threatened is the president of the republic”, PSG Commander Colonel Jesus Durante was cited by the media as saying.

Philippines’ Duterte Threatens to Shoot Rioters Amid COVID-19 Lockdown

The detentions come after the Philippine president last month pledged a crackdown on those who violate the confinement measures that were introduced by the government in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

“I will not hesitate. My orders are for the police, the military and the villages, in case there’s trouble and there’s an occasion where they fight and your life is threatened, shoot them dead”, Duterte said in a televised address to the nation in early April.

On 16 March, he announced a six-month state of emergency in the Philippines, a move that stipulates the so-called “community quarantines” being enforced in most of the country, including on the island of Luzon, which includes the capital, Manila and some neighbourhoods in Quezon City, where mass gatherings are now banned, among other things.

The relatively low number of COVID-19 cases reported in Africa so far leave room for hope that the continent may be ""spared the worst"" of the ongoing pandemic, the United Nations announced in its recent executive summary regarding the impact of the new coronavirus on the continent that was released on 20 May.

Noting that ""most countries"" in Africa have recorded fewer that 1,000 coronavirus cases, the UN also praised the rapid response of the African Union which ""acted swiftly, endorsing a joint continental strategy in February, and complementing efforts by Member States and Regional Economic Communities by providing a public health platform"".

The summary points out, however, that it is too early to know the full impact of COVID-19 on Africa, and that the ""indirect consequences beyond health"", such as food insecurity, loss of income, looming debt crisis and ""related political and security risks"", for example, ""already bring a heavy toll"".

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has declared that the United Nations is calling for international action to ""strengthen Africa’s health systems, maintain food supplies, avoid a financial crisis, support education, protect jobs, keep households and businesses afloat, and cushion the continent against lost income and export earnings"".

""I have been calling for a global response package amounting to at least 10 percent of the world’s Gross Domestic Product. For Africa, that means more than $200 billion as additional support from the international community"", he stated.

Guterres also noted that African countries should also be provided quick and affordable access to ""any eventual vaccine and treatment"" for the malady in question.

Stars and Stripes on Thursday called attention to what is now AFRICOM’s five-week break from airstrikes in Somalia - the longest hiatus in air-based attacks from the force in over a year.

Despite a pause in reported airstrikes since the April 10 strike against an al-Shabaab terrorist in Jamaame, Somalia, the military force has not ceased additional operations in and around the region, AFRICOM spokesperson Col. Chris Karns insisted.

“With the rainy season there can be shifts in al-Shabaab and broader activity,” the AFRICOM spokesperson claimed. “There is always effort, not always opportunity to conduct airstrikes. There is certainly no pause.”

According to recent numbers from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Somalia, 24 people have been killed and an estimated 283,000 have been displaced following heavy rains in the country triggered by the warming Indian Ocean.

AFRICOM managed to conduct a total of 40 airstrikes in Somalia within the first four months of 2020 - a significant increase after only 63 airstrikes were conducted in 2019.

The frequency of airstrikes against militants in Somalia began to increase following al-Shabaab’s January 5 attack on Kenyan and American troops at the Kenyan Defense Force Military Base in Manda Bay.

During its five-week halt on airstrikes, the US released its first quarterly casualties report and confessed to killing two Somali civilians and injuring at least three more in a single airstrike.

“While we follow very precise and rigorous standards, in instances where we fail to meet our expectations, we will admit the mistake,” AFRICOM Commander US Army Gen. Stephen Townsend said in the report.

“Regrettably two civilians were killed and three others injured in a February 2019 airstrike. We have the highest respect for our Somali friends, and we are deeply sorry this occurred.”

The authenticity of AFRICOM’s reporting on civilian casualties in Somalia has previously been brought into question by human rights organization Amnesty International.

More recently, AFRICOM has been providing COVID-19 novel coronavirus-related humanitarian assistance to countries in Africa grappling with the highly contagious disease.

Peter Grosskopf, chief executive officer at Sprott Inc, is even more upbeat about the future of gold. Grosskopf, who described gold prices as a ""chameleon"" and ""anti-confidence thermometer"" that does equally well during times of deflation and inflation, said the precious metal could break its previous peak of $1,891 in 2011 and may be trading at more than $1,900 or $2,000 for an ounce by the end of 2020.

According to radio station Cadena Cope, La Liga’s administrators have ruled out a comeback on the 12th of June, the initial date that was earmarked for the resumption of play, due to health and safety fears.

Players in Spain have been gradually easing their way back into training on an individual basis and were scheduled to link up with their teammates for group sessions next week.

The differences between the autonomous region’s stances on the Coronavirus lockdown, akin to the clashes between Westminster and the devolved governments of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales in the UK, have however caused a delay, as some areas have been out of complete lockdown for longer than others.

Speaking to the Spanish press; LaLiga President Javier Tebas expressed optimism that the 2019-20 season, will be able to be concluded on the pitch.

“Clubs, directors, players and referees are all keen to start the season again but the competition will only start when the health authorities consider it to be possible. Coordination with CSD (Spanish Sports Council) and the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) will be key.” – Tebas stated.

English Premier League clubs have also tentatively commenced group training sessions, ahead of their own potential kick off in June.

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp; whose side sit top of the division, yesterday outlined his desire to get back in action.

“I woke up even earlier than usual and then I realised it was my first day, It felt like the first day at school - for me, it was 46 years ago, but it must have been similar. I dressed myself in my uniform again - and for the right reason, for going to training.” – Klopp told Liverpool’s official website.

Other leading figures have however been critical of the decision to encourage teams to return to training.

Pundit and former Liverpool and England midfielder Jamie Redknapp believed that the potential withdrawal of players from squads for personal reasons, could lead to an unfair competition, with some teams boasting much stronger starting elevens.

""I've spoken to managers, there's a lot more to come out that just don't feel right about it, that’s going to be a major problem. If you've got a squad of 22, 23 players and six or seven are not comfortable, they think they're putting their families at risk, how is that a fair competition? It becomes a real Premier League problem. It doesn't become fair.” – Redknapp said to Sky Sports.

Premier League teams have been at odds over the so-called “Project Restart”, despite voting in favour of resuming full contact training next week.

Questions still remain about the provision of personal protective equipment, transit to and from stadiums, and the potential use of neutral venues.

If the sides cannot iron out their differences before the start of June; then only a few viable ways to conclude the season remain.

These include rendering the season “null and void”, calculating the final positions based on mathematical algorithms, or simply ending the league with the current standings in place.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

Former chair of the Commons Select Committee Damian Collins has called on the UK government to provide financial support for vulnerable football clubs.

Collins claims that in next five weeks five to 10 EFL League clubs could go into administration.

""We saw the outcry last summer when two clubs, Bury and Bolton, were in trouble. If that happens there will be huge public demand to do something,” he said as quoted by the Sky Sports News.

""Without the government stepping in, those clubs could go to the wall and there maybe others that follow,"" he added.

He added that many League 1 and 2 teams in the EFL were in a risky state even before the Covid-19 pandemic began.

According to him, taxpayers' money should not be used to buy players but should solely be used to guarantee that clubs are financially sustainable.

The Premier League has been suspended since 13 March because of the Covid-19 pandemic and is looking to restart its campaign in mid-June.

""It's very ugly, I watched German football and it's lamentable. You can hear the insults and you lose the intimacy of the great moments, playing matches without a supporter is sadder than dancing with your sister,"" Enrique stated.

The coach did, however, concede that the return of sport in any capacity could help bolster the morale of sports fans throughout the world.

""This is a global business that generates a lot of money and even though the spectacle is very different to when you play with people, it can help us pass the time during confinement and get through this, and if you are a fan of football or basketball, then watching a match is always interesting,"" he said.

​Clubs in Europe have until the 25th of May to tell UEFA, Europe’s football governing body, whether they intend to resume the 2019-20 season.

The Netherlands, France, Belgium and now Scotland have already decided to end their campaigns prematurely, whilst England, Spain and Italy plan to follow Germany’s example and resume play behind closed doors.

Many players in England’s Premier League; most notably Watford striker Troy Deeney, and Tottenham Hotspur left-back Danny Rose, have expressed concerns about the potential health and safety risks that completing the season may bring.

Deeney’s Watford teammate, centre-back Adrian Mariappa has also revealed his coronavirus diagnosis, no doubt compounding the fears of fellow professional athletes.

Speaking to British Newspaper the Telegraph, Mariappa explained that he was shocked by the news.

""It was a big surprise because I haven't really left the house, apart from some exercise and the odd walk with the kids; I've mainly just been homeschooling and keeping fit,” the defender stated.

Mariappa added that he was fortunate to have been able to access a coronavirus test, despite being asymptomatic.

“It's quite scary how you can feel absolutely fine and not really have left the house, and yet still get the virus. If it wasn't for the fact I had gone back to training and had this test, then I'd never have found out that I had the virus and I would just be getting on with things as normal. That's obviously quite a strange thought,” he added.

Premier League clubs are yet to agree on the terms under which the season could be resumed, and a vote on whether to host matches at neutral venues has been postponed, as rumours had arisen that a majority of sides in the division would vote against the proposals.

If the suggestion is eventually ruled out after the ballot takes place; then it would be doubtful whether Premier League games could actually return to the pitch, as only a few options for concluding the campaign would remain viable.

These include rendering the season “null and void”, calculating the final positions based on mathematical algorithms, or simply ending the league with the current standings in place, all of which could potentially lead to legal challenges from teams in bother the upper and lower echelons of the division.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

According to The Independent, the so-called ""Big Six"" English Premier League clubs, namely Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, are opposed to new broadcast plans that aim to give fans a closer look behind the scenes.

The Premier League’s powers have proposed conducting interviews at half-time, and filming team talks in a bid to drum up interest and to compensate for the lack of fan-generated atmosphere, should the division resume play behind closed doors in June.

The Big Six claim that this would add nothing to the ""viewing experience"" enjoyed by spectators, whilst undercutting their own private media channels, which are valuable sources of revenue in the absence of gate receipts.

Teams in England’s top flight have returned to training in the past few days, despite not yet reaching a consensus on issues such as whether to play the remaining matches of the 2019-20 season at neutral venues.

A vote on the matter was supposed to take place last week but was postponed as fears arose that the proposal could be rejected.

Numerous players, including Watford striker Troy Deeney, Tottenham Hotspur left-back Danny Rose, and former England right-back Glen Johnson, have also voiced criticism of plans for players to resume group training, arguing that not enough thought has been given to the player’s health and safety, on and off the pitch.

""Yes, I would […] I don’t know why it wouldn’t be. I don’t think that this virus will last for ever. I think it will [change] sooner than many think"", Ceferin said, when asked about the possible bet.

He also said that he is personally sure that football with fans in attendance will return very soon.

""I don’t like this apocalyptic view that we have to wait for the second and third waves or even a fifth wave […] people you know are likely to die one day, but do we have to be worried today?

British Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has stated that it could soon be safe for the English Premier League to resume play amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Speaking to radio station LBC, Dowden stated that a possible return could be sealed by June.

""We are hoping to get Premiership, Premier League, up and running from the middle of June, but clearly, in all of this, we’re going to be guided by the evidence and the public health. If we can be confident that we have met that and we are making good progress, then we would aim to do that”, the minister said.

The culture secretary also addressed the matter of whether the Championship, the second tier of English football, will be able to complete its season, and whether matches should be played behind closed doors.

""Well I imagine it would begin with the Premier League. I think the EFL might start with the Championship a little bit after that, but I should caution in all of this. We said that at the beginning, from the beginning of June would be the earliest. I think it’s more likely to be mid-June. It would be behind closed doors and we would only do it if it was safe to do so, so we are continuing those discussions but we are making good progress"", Dowden told LBC.

Football in the UK has been suspended since March due to the ongoing threat posed by the coronavirus pandemic and Europe’s professional football associations have until 25 May to report to UEFA, the continent’s governing body, whether they intend to press on with their seasons.

The Netherlands, France, Belgium, and now Scotland have already thrown in the towel and ended their campaigns prematurely, whilst England, Spain, Italy, and Germany are pressing ahead with plans to resume play.

A particular sticking point in the discussions between teams in England’s top flight has been the proposal to host matches at neutral venues, which many sides argue would deprive them of the valuable home advantage and pose severe logistical problems.

Premier League clubs are set to vote on whether the move to use neutral grounds to see out the season should go ahead later this week, after the ballot was called off last week over fears that the proposal could be shot down.

If the suggestion is ruled out, then only a few options for concluding the campaign remain viable.

These include rendering the season “null and void”, calculating the final positions based on mathematical algorithms, or simply ending the league with the current standings in place.

All of these scenarios could prove problematic to clubs in both the upper and lower echelons of the Premier League.

The Scottish Premier League voted to end their season prematurely earlier today, whilst enforcing league positions as they stood at the time of its suspension.

The offer was really good, but Salah discussed it with me and Mr Cuper [the former coach of Egypt's national football team ], and he decided to stay with Liverpool because he was comfortable there"", Ramzy told OnTime Sports.

It appears that Salah's decision to stay at Anfield paid off. The Reds, who lost to Real Madrid in the Champions League final that year, performed brilliantly the following year.

This means that the teams who lack the facilities to test players for the disease would not be able to comply with the necessary health and safety instructions stipulated by the so-called “Project Restart” plan, which aims to facilitate the resumption of matches by mid-June.

Back in February, the six-time Ballon d’Or winner said the Catalan giants do not have what it takes to win the competition.

In an interview with the magazine Sport, Messi said he never doubted the squad or the manager.

""What I meant to say is that the performance we displayed in the games before the break [caused by the coronavirus pandemic] was not enough for us to win the Champions League. Now, everyone has their own opinion and I respect them. Mine is based on the fact that I was lucky to play in the Champions League every year and I know that it is not possible to win it by playing as we did"", the 32-year-old told Sport.

Messi, who has played for Barcelona since 2003, has won the prestigious football tournament four times, the last one in the 2014-15 season. This year the Catalan club had successfully qualified for the playoff stage, but its first 1/8 match with Italian club Napoli ended in a draw and midfielder Arturo Vidal being sent off the pitch. The second match, which was scheduled for 18 March, was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Messi claims that the break may benefit the squad, allowing the players to leave all doubts in the past.

""Results from ground-based missions like this help NASA prepare for the real-life challenges of space exploration and provide important scientific data to solve some of these problems and to develop countermeasures”, NASA said in a statement.

Despite most people being tired of confinement within their homes during the coronavirus pandemic, social media users expressed keen interest in the project.

New research has now emerged that might soon become a further target for Donald Trump's ire.

A new observational study conducted among more than 96,000 patients diagnosed with coronavirus and treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine concluded that the usage of these drugs was associated with a higher risk of death or development of hearth arrhythmias among recipients, according to the medical journal The Lancet that published the research.

“We were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19”, the study’s authors wrote. “Each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of COVID-19”.

The observed patients, hospitalised between 20 December 2019 and 14 April 2020, were recruited from 671 hospitals in six continents and divided into five groups: those who did not receive any treatment by these drugs (control group), those who were treated with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine alone, and those who received any of these drugs in combination with macrolide (antibiotic).

The researchers found that the mortality rate was the highest among those 6,221 patients who received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (23.8%), while the treatment of coronavirus with hydroxychloroquine alone in a group comprising 3,016 patients resulted in an 18% death rate. Those 8% of patients combining HCQ with antibiotics were also more likely to develop a heart arrhythmia, the study argues.

Meanwhile, around 1 in 6 patients treated with chloroquine (16.4%) and 22.2% of those who combined it with an antibiotic died during the study.

In comparison, only 1 in 11 hospitalised patients from the control group fell victim to coronavirus during this period. However, to be fair, the control group was the largest one observed in the study, covering more than 80,000 patients, around 7,546 of whom died.

These results prompted scientists to conclude that the treatment of coronavirus with HCQ was not really beneficial.

“Previous small-scale studies have failed to identify robust evidence of a benefit and larger, randomised controlled trials are not yet completed”, said the study’s co-author, Dr. Frank Ruschitzka, as cited by CNN. “However, we now know from our study that the chance that these medications improve outcomes in COVID-19 is quite low”.

This research was published shortly after US President Donald Trump revealed this week that he was taking HCQ as a precautionary measure against coronavirus, despite warnings from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about the risks of doing so outside of a hospital setting and without proper vetting from health authorities. Hydroxychloroquine has been widely used in America for the treatment of malaria, lupus and some other diseases upon prescription for more than six decades, however its utility for the treatment of coronavirus is at best unproven.

“That was a false study done. Where they gave it to very sick people. Extremely sick people. People that were ready to die. It was given by obviously not friends of the administration”, Trump said during a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

The US president still insists that the use of HCQ to fight COVID-19 is a ""game changer” and he slammed an earlier non-peer reviewed study that found a link between the use of the antimalaria drug and an increasing number of deaths among corona-stricken veterans.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

A mysterious “black domed saucer” was spotted in Bristol, according to an eyewitness, who managed to capture images of “chemical trails” behind the object on camera and then share the photos with MUFON, the group investigating alien sightings. The images have been recently analysed by self-titled UFO expert Scott C. Waring, who said that the pics conclusively show “a UFO shooting into the sky from Bristol” to monitor the lockdown in the UK.

“Its a fantastic example of how UFOs can make clouds!”, Waring wrote on his blog ET Data Base. “Sometimes UFOs do come down to visit and explore while a lockdown is in place in the UK. Maybe someone saw it or frightened it an it shot upward into the sky leaving a smokey trail.”

​The photos were reportedly taken on 17 March, and according to the eyewitness statement provided on the blog, the cloud line could not have been left by a civil aircraft as due to coronavirus restrictions “no planes were flying in the area”. Instead, the author claimed that the trail came from “a black domed saucer” that was spotted “sitting” just above the cloud.

“The movement of the object was pulse like, it spurted for a distance, then slowed, then spurted again”, the spectator assured. “This seemed to be the pattern of propulsion. It was vertical, so not similar to the aircraft that would normally fly over horizontally.”

According to him, “no military vehicles” were flying nearby and it seemed unlikely that such a chemical trail could have been a result of drone activity.

In any case, the authenticity of the images and eyewitness’s statements could not be properly collaborated and confirmed, despite Waring’s enthusiasm. The prominent alien hunter still insisted that even UFOs are able to make clouds, citing the famous example of US Navy radar footage recently released and confirmed by the US Department of Defence. The infrared videos were showing some glowing “unidentified aerial phenomena” flying erratically and Pentagon had to admit that the true nature of these objects could not be determined.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

The US has the highest number of coronavirus cases as, according to data presented by the Johns Hopkins University, 1.7 million Americans have been infected.

US President Donald Trump spent Saturday playing golf at one of his family-owned resorts outside of Washington DC, in a move that US media outlets suggest is a signal to the public that it is right for the United States to return to normal activities amid the coronavirus pandemic, even in areas that are the hardest hit by the deadly disease. A photojournalist caught the moment as Trump left the White House for the resort.

​This was the first time that the 73-year-old Trump has engaged in his favorite leisure pastime since 8 March.

In another sign that Trump wants the country to reopen as a means of boosting business activity, the US president has resumed travelling across the country. This month he visited Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania, key swing states in the upcoming 2020 presidential election. On 22 May, Trump called on US state governors to reopen houses of worship – churches, temples, synagogues and mosques, which are currently shuttered to assist in slowing the spread of the disease. The president claims that lifting the health measures are essential, declaring: “in America, we need more prayer, not less” and threatening to override governors who refuse to do as he demands.

Trump, in the middle of a deadly and ongoing pandemic, has been actively promoting to reopen the United States solely as a means of bolstering the country’s economy, which has sustained severe losses during the lockdowns. Almost 39 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits since the country introduced safety measures to slow the spread of the virus. All states have made limited reopenings after a two-month shutdown, with various degrees of restrictions.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

The Trump administration is considering the possibility of creating a new unit at the State Department that will deal with global responses to future outbreaks of infectious diseases, according to documents obtained by Politico.

Part of an effort in the President’s Response to Outbreaks (PRO), the proposal may also create “an alternative mechanism to some of the work” conducted by the World Health Organisation (WHO) following the White House’s move to suspend US funding for the UN body.

Politico reported that the new State Department unit was discussed during a recent National Security Council meeting, in a sign of the ongoing “turf battle” between the State Department and the US Agency for International Development (USAID).

USAID officials were reportedly “surprised and perplexed by the idea, which could lead them to lose control of significant funds and authorities”. One USAID official was quoted by Politico as saying that the proposal was a “power-grab” by the State Department.

The news outlet also cited unnamed sources as saying that Doctor Deborah Birx, a senior US official who currently deals with Washington’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, may be at the helm of the new unit “if it becomes a reality”.

The proposed initiative stipulates the State Department appointing a coordinator who will oversee almost “every aspect of pandemic preparedness and response — from the global distribution of vaccines and therapeutics to the development of modernised protocols to prevent the spread of an outbreak”, according to the sources.

Trump Weighs Restoring Partial US Funding for WHO

Plans on the creation of a new State Department unit come after President Donald Trump tweeted in mid-May that he was considering restoring at least 10 percent of US funding for the WHO that was frozen last month.

""This is just one of numerous concepts being considered under which we would pay 10% of what we have been paying over many years”, he wrote in a tweet, adding that he has “not made final decision"".

Lou, this is just one of numerous concepts being considered under which we would pay 10% of what we have been paying over many years, matching much lower China payments. Have not made final decision. All funds are frozen. Thanks! https://t.co/xQUzHy4NDa — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2020

In April, POTUS announced that the US’ funding of the WHO would be halted over negligence, claiming that the UN health agency had impeded the global response to the coronavirus pandemic and let it spread by covering up the true scale of the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China - allegations that Beijing rejects.

The US president also announced a suspension period of 60 to 90 days pending the completion of a probe of the WHO and China's actions during the onset of the pandemic.

The decision was slammed by the WHO and the international community, with the US Chamber of Commerce claiming that POTUS had compromised the country’s interests by ending Washington's funding for the agency.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, for his part, underscored that it was ""not the time to reduce the resources for the WHO […] in the fight against the virus”. According to the organisation’s latest situation report, there are more than 4.9 million COVID-19 cases across the globe, with 327,738 fatalities.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

The Microsoft co-founder, meanwhile, has contributed millions of dollars to the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and testing, as part of global efforts to fight the virus.

More than 40% of self-described Republicans and Fox News viewers believe in a conspiracy theory that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates plans to use a future COVID-19 vaccine in order to implant microchips in billions of people and monitor their movements, a new Yahoo News/YouGov poll has revealed.

Some 26% of respondents, however, rejected the theory as false, and 31% more said that they were not sure.

They were echoed by 45% of independents, 52% of Democrats, and 63% of people who say they voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election, stating that they don't believe in the vaccine conspiracy theory, especially Gates’ alleged involvement in it, according to the poll.

The survey also found that only half of Americans are ready to get vaccinated “if and when a coronavirus vaccine becomes available”. Twenty-three percent of respondents said that they would not do so, with 27% admitting that they were still sitting on the fence.

The poll comes after a bizarre rant by Italian lawmaker and vocal anti-vax activist Sara Cunial who last week hit out at Gates as she urged fellow MPs to defy any plans for compulsory vaccination against the coronavirus.

In an apparent reference to the billionaire pumping hefty sums into the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, Cunial asserted that “the real goal of all of this is total control” and “absolute domination of human beings, transformed into guinea pigs and slaves, violating sovereignty, and free will"".

She went even further by saying that “next time you receive a phone call from the philanthropist Bill Gates forward it directly to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity”.

The controversial claims followed the Microsoft co-founder saying in an interview with CNBC in April about “a huge challenge” pertaining to “the efficacy of vaccines in older people”.

“Here, we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range, because they're most at risk of that. And doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people, and yet you don’t have side effects. You know, if we have, you know, one in 10,000 side effects, that's, you know, way more - 700,000, you know, people - who will suffer from that”, Gates added.

The interview was preceded by the billionaire injecting hundreds of millions of dollars, including $100 million through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, into the coronavirus vaccine and testing, as part of international efforts to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a separate interview with CNN, Gates described current US coronavirus testing data as ""bogus"" because of its inaccuracy and slow turnaround, adding that Washington “does not prioritise who gets tested and […] does not make sure you get results in 24 hours”.

President Donald Trump, for his part, pledged that there would be a vaccine against the coronavirus in the US by the end of 2020, adding that the country will have it “much sooner rather than later"".",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

""The positive assessment of the president's performance in the past month has been confined to a narrow bracket of 61-63 percent. Trust in Putin during the same period remained within the 67-68 percent bracket,"" Valery Fedorov said.

Fedorov added that the pollster last conducted a survey to measure Putin's rating in terms of voter intent two years ago. He said the question of whether people planned to vote for him had since been replaced by an assessment of his performance and the level of trust in him.

Earlier the US news agency Bloomberg has reported, citing VTsIOM figures, that Putin's rating dropped to a record low of 27 percent in April as the coronavirus pandemic continues to weigh on the national economy.

The Russian Foreign Ministry slammed the report, showing that the real figures provided by VTsIOM, which Bloomberg claimed to cite, were altered in the report.

""The editors of Bloomberg continue to show complete disrespect for its readers. They probably hope that their audience will not check Russian sources and find a real WCIOM data"", the Russian Embassy in the United States said on Twitter.

On Tuesday, Bloomberg published an opinion piece titled ""How Putin's Russia Bungled the Pandemic"" in which the author cites statistics, allegedly derived from the 2013 World Bank data, to claim that Russia has only 3.8 hospital beds per 1,000 population, while the OECD member countries have an average of 8.2 beds. The actual statistics of the World Bank, on the other hand, is complete opposite — it is 8.2 beds in Russia versus an average of 3.8 beds in OECD countries.

The Russian embassy in the US pointed to the mistake. Shortly later, Bloomberg corrected the figures in the article, with a footnote reading ""Corrects to fix transposed labels in the chart titled 'Surgical Cuts.'""",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

In April, despite economic hardships triggered by the coronavirus pandemic the gold reserves accumulated by the Bank of Russia made it possible to prevent the ruble from tumbling significantly, while maintaining foreign exchange reserves at a record high.

Financial experts are convinced that investments in the precious metal will serve a double dividend, by not only channeling revenue to the Central Bank coffers, but also helping to sharply reduce the share of the US dollar in international settlements.

Going for the Gold

In the last five years, Russia has significantly boosted its gold reserves, with the current COVID-19 health crisis and its fallout for the global economy confirming the soundness of this strategy.

Notwithstanding currency interventions in support of the ruble, soaring prices for precious metals enabled the Bank of Russia to retain gold and foreign exchange reserves.

In March and April, the Central Bank spent $6.6 billion, selling off $250-$300 million a day, according to rbc. As a result, the ruble lost some 20 percent of its value – not as much as it could have given the fact that oil prices had shrunk almost threefold. According to the calculations of Gazprombank analysts, without foreign exchange interventions the dollar by the beginning of May would have been worth over 110 rubles.

In April, the value of the Russian central bank’s gold reserves grew by $6.244 billion, or 5.2 percent, reaching a value equivalent of over $126 billion, or 21.3 percent of the bank’s total reserves, according to figures released by the regulator.

Partly triggered by bullion’s growing worth as a stable store of value amid the global economic slump, the soaring gold stocks caused total reserves to grow by 0.45 percent in the month of April, reaching a total of $566 billion.

The past four months have witnessed Russian reserves overall growing a net 2.1 percent.

The Russian Central Bank’s international reserves, consisting of bullion, foreign currency reserves and special drawing rights assets, form a “rainy day” investment fund for the Russian government.

According to the World Gold Council (WGC), in 2018 Russia bought 274.3 tons of gold, in 2019 - 158.1, and so far in 2020 - 28 tons.

This week, gold has been trading at its highest since October 2012, at $1,764.55.

In global markets on 21 May, Gold eased 1 percent to $1,732.43 per ounce, while US gold futures shed 1.1 percent to $1,733.60 per ounce.

""Gold seems to have lost a little momentum since breaking above $1,750 and the rise in the dollar today doesn't seem to be helping,"" OANDA analyst Craig Erlam was cited as saying by Reuters.

Analysts are convinced this is not the limit, as precious metal is the most reliable investment tool in a crisis.

The developments come as investor confidence in US government bonds has been rapidly declining, with yields on the bonds stalling near all-time lows.

According to Treasury Department data cited by the outlet on 15 May, foreign investors sold a record amount of US Treasury bonds and notes for the month of March.

“It was a pretty large liquidation from a lot of the foreign accounts. And it makes a lot of sense because there was a lot of precautionary liquidation given all the uncertainty, especially in emerging market economies,” Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates analyst at TD Securities in New York was quoted as saying.

Foreigners were cited as selling $299.346 billion in Treasuries in March, a record high, compared with foreign buying of $4.885 billion in February.

In March, Saudi Arabia was one of the biggest sellers of Treasuries, with its holdings sinking to $159.1 billion, from $184.4 billion in February.

The Bank of Russia, which back in 2018 rapidly sold off the vast majority of its stash of US treasury bonds on the market, has slashed the remainder threefold - from $12.58 billion to $3.85 billion.

Buyers of US-extracted liquefied natural gas (LNG) may cancel up to 60 percent of July orders, as the energy industry is reeling from a global glut caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Bloomberg reports, citing a survey of traders.

There are five LNG export terminals in the United States, operated by four companies. They could get requests to scrap from 35 to 45 cargoes scheduled to be unloaded in July, according to traders' estimates. That compares with 75 shipments delivered to global customers in January and 61 in April.

Houston-based Cheniere Energy, the biggest US producer of LNG, has been asked to cancel 30 cargoes due for loading in July from buyers with long-term supply contracts, industry sources told Bloomberg. It has received just 10 such requests for June. It is understood that similar requests have been submitted to other American exporters.

Analysts note that LNG exporters are currently operating at negative profit margins because of weak demand, limited storage capacity and a fall in prices coupled with higher transportation costs due to the relative distance of US-based terminals from destination markets.

This means that customers may well keep cancelling orders through October of this year, before European customers will be able to free up space in storage sites to receive more imports.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

The wealthiest 600+ Americans saw their total wealth increase by $434 billion between March 18, when the government began implementing coronavirus-related lockdowns, and May 19, Americans for Tax Fairness, a Washington-based nonprofit, has reported, citing Forbes data.

The payday added about 15 percent to the exclusive group’s portfolios, with their total wealth jumping from about $2.948 trillion in March to $3.382 trillion now.

What’s more, the nonprofit found, the richest five men in America, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett and Larry Ellison, saw their wealth grow even more, by a total of $75.5 billion, or 19 percent, during the same period. The five men alone are said to have lapped up 21 percent of the overall increase in wealth among the 600+ richest Americans during this period.

The news comes amid reports Thursday that some 38.6 million Americans have now filed for unemployment in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, with 2.4 million claims filed in the last week alone. As many as 16 million workers have also likely lost employer-provided health insurance, while some 1.5 million Americans have fallen ill to the coronavirus, which has caused over 90,000 deaths in the US to date.

The spike in wealth inequality comes despite US lawmakers’ passage of several aid packages worth over $6 trillion since March, including a one-time direct payment of $1,200 to every American adult and $500 per child, hundreds of billions for unemployment benefits and other department of labor programs, as well as trillions for banks, major industries, and state, territorial local and tribal governments.

The spending has led the US national debt to skyrocket to nearly $25 trillion, which is 117 percent the size of America’s annual GDP.

Warren Buffett, who has seen his wealth balloon by $564 million over the past two months, has praised the government’s strategy of introducing more cash into the economy, but warned that there’s such a thing as too much of a good thing. “I think in general they’re the right thing, but I don’t think they’re without consequences, and I think they could be of extreme consequences if pushed far enough,” he said, speaking at a shareholder’s meeting in early May.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

""I continue to tell only the truth about the situation of French companies and enterprises. And I have to admit that at the moment Renault has its very existence at stake,"" the minister said.

Le Maire also specified he has not yet signed a document to provide a state-guaranteed loan of five billion euros (over $5,4 billion) that the carmaker had requested to overcome the damage caused by the COVID-19 disease.

The minister added that the government expects that automakers requesting support commit to developing and producing electric vehicles, having fair relations with contractors and implementing the most advanced technologies in the French territory.

Renault, whose 15-percent share is owned by the French government, was experiencing financial hardships even before the COVID-19 outbreak, having suffered its first net loss in 10 years in 2019. When a two-month lockdown was introduced in France in mid-March, the automaker was forced to close all its factories.

Notably, new car sales in France fell in April by 88.8 percent, according to the report by the French Automobile Manufacturers Committee (CCFA), published on May 4. Car sales in Europe fell by 76.3 percent in April.

According to yet unconfirmed information published in French newspaper Le Canard enchained on Wednesday, Renault plans to close four plants in France, namely, in Flins, Dieppe, Choisy-le-Roi and Fonderie de Bretagne.

This decision will be made within the framework of a program to reduce costs by 2 billion euros, which is to be unveiled on May 29.

France began gradually easing its coronavirus-related restrictions on May 11 by partially reopening non-grocery shops, cafes, parks, educational facilities and other public places in so-called green areas of the country, which are less affected by the virus.

So-called red, or highly infected regions, however, remain under strict monitoring and related safety measures. As of Friday, French authorities have reported 181,951 COVID-19 cases, the world’s seventh-highest, with 28,218 related fatalities.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

Sanctions against the Iraqi oil industry were immediately dropped and dozens of Western companies rushed in to make money.

A barrister representing a British businessman accused of bribing an Iraqi oil official has told a trial in London the evidence against him included the ""flimsiest of innuendos.""

Adrian Eissa QC said his client, Stephen Whiteley, 65, had not been a party to any corrupt payments made by his employer, Monaco-based Unaoil via an intermediary, Basil al-Jarah.

Adrian Eissa QC tells jury evidence against his client is ""flimsy innuendo"". Stephen Whiteley and two others deny bribing Iraqi oil officials to get $800m contracts after the fall of Saddam Hussein. (Trial has been moved from Southwark Crown Court because of social distancing)... — Total Crime (@totalcrime) May 21, 2020

​Whiteley is accused, along with Ziad Akle, 45, and Paul Bond, 68, of conspiracy to give corrupt payments to Oday Al Quoraishi, an official in Iraq’s state-owned South Oil Company in return for a lucrative contract for single point moorings (SPM) equipment between 2009 and 2010.

Akle and Whiteley are also accused of bribing Al Quoraishi - who was nicknamed Ivan because of his predilection for Russian women - for an oil pipeline contract.

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which has brought the prosecution, claims a total of US$6 million (£4.7 million) was offered to Al Quoraishi in exchange for contracts worth a total of $800 million.

All three men deny the charges. Their trial began at Southwark Crown Court in London in January but was halted for nine weeks because of the coronavirus outbreak and has now resumed at the Old Bailey in central London.

At the start of the trial the prosecutor, Martin Brompton QC, said: ""This case concerns bribery and corruption connected to the reconstruction of the Iraqi oil industry in the years following the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003.”

Mr Brompton said: ""By the time of Saddam’s overthrow, the infrastructure required for the successful production and distribution of crude oil and dilapidated. Plans were made by the Iraqi ministry of oil to hugely increase the country’s oil producing industry.""

Iraq sought to expand its production of oil from 1.8 million barrels per day to 4.5 million bpd and needed to build more pipelines and facilities for oil tankers.

Mr Brompton claimed Unaoil’s role was to seek to get the SPM contract for SBM Offshore, a Netherlands-based company who Paul Bond worked for, and Leighton Offshore, a Singapore firm and he claimed bribes were paid.

On Thursday, 21 May, Mr Eissa led the jury through a number of emails which were at the heart of the prosecution case.

He said one email referred to Whiteley giving Al Quoraishi a “good night out” in London in October 2009 and he said the prosecution sought to imply that because of that he must have known about the corrupt payments.

But Mr Eissa said the prosecution’s case was built on the “flimsiest of innuendos”.

Mr Eissa said his client was only on the “periphery” of the pipeline deal which had its own project manager, Peter Willimont.

Mr Eissa said that explained why Whiteley was not cc’d into numerous emails about Unaoil’s projects in Iraq and he said his client was “on the outside looking in.”

He said Whiteley had “zero motivation” to get involved in the pipeline deal and Mr Eissa pointed to several emails which made it clear that his client was “focusing on Angola”, where Unaoil was seeking to make money from that country’s oil industry.

When the SFO launched an investigation into Unaoil in 2017 Whiteley “volunteered” to be interviewed by them.

Mr Eissa said: “He said he had attended a presentation in Dubai and that was all about Iraq. It’s not his fault that the SFO did not answer any follow-up questions. If he had something to hide about his work in Iraq why would he mention the presentation in Dubai?”

Mr Eissa, finishing his closing speech to the jury, told them: “If you have a doubt about Mr Whiteley’s guilt, hang on to it and guard it jealously because we say a proper analysis of evidence shows Stephen Whiteley is not guilty on both counts.”

When Akle gave evidence in March - before the trial was suspended because of the coronavirus outbreak - he claimed he had “sweated blood” to ensure the success of Iraq’s oil expansion project and said he feared a “stitch-up” by deputy oil minister Ahmed al-Shamaa.

Akle said he believed al-Shamaa wanted to derail SOC’s plans and take over the pipeline and SPM project for himself.

The indictments against Akle, Whiteley and Bond also named several other alleged co-conspirators who are not on trial. They include the founder of Unaoi, Ata Ahsani and his sons Cyrus and Saman, Mr Willimont, Basil al-Jarah and two of Bond’s “bosses” at SBM - Patrick Chapalain and Stephane Montbarbon.

Howard Godfrey QC, representing Bond, said his client - a former woodwork teacher - was not an “intellectual” and had been “taken for a ride” by his bosses.

He said: “Our case is that Paul Bond is a thoroughly decent, straight, honest guy who has got completely out of his depth with what was going on around him.”

Mr Godfrey said Bond worked extremely hard, staying up late at night and even making a “dangerous trip” to Basra in Iraq in an attempt to win the SPM contract and he said Bond was blissfully unaware of any corruption or bribes.

Referring to the trip to Basra, Mr Godfrey said: “Do you think he would have worked so had if he had known that thanks to the al-Jarah bribe it was a done deal? It makes no sense.”

The jury is expected to retire and consider its verdict next week.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

Still, for some, where there’s a crisis, there’s a profit to be made.

As the world continues to face the grim social and economic realitities of a coronavirus-ridden world, and the US alone faces a staggering 39 million lost jobs since March, a select few group of billionaires has managed not only to keep their heads above water, but take advantage of bearish market conditions to add billions to their fortunes.

Among these fortunate few is famed investor Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate holding company sold a whopping 84 percent of its stake in Goldman Sachs last quarter, earning $3 billion+ in cash, 12 years after investing in the bank to help bail it out during the 2008 financial crisis. The earnings included $1.2 billion in dividends, plus over $1.4 billion from the stock selloff.

George Soros, the US Hungarian-born financier with a penchant for meddling in the affairs of foreign nations going to back to the 1980s, made some bold market moves of his own in the past couple of months, purchasing a $5 million stake in Disney, and increasing his investment in US exercise equipment and media company Peloton by more than ten-fold, to $79 million, while continuing to build shares in real estate investment trust AGNC by 22 percent, with total holdings now worth $21 million. During the same period, Soros added 1.7 million shares to his holdings of Alberta-based energy company Cenovus Energy (with total shares now worth $7 million+, and NiSource, Inc, a gas and electricity holding company operating across seven US states, with total investments of over $6.7 million. Overall, the string of share buys is expected to net Soros Fund Management between 3 and 11.5 percent dividends in the coming months, not a bad deal considering most of the world’s central banks have switched to sub-zero bond rates in recent months. In addition to the above-mentioned operations, Soros’ hedge fund has also been busy buying, selling, adding, dumping, and researching dozens more companies in operations worth hundreds of millions of dollars during the first quarter of 2020.

Then there’s Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, already the wealthiest man alive, who has reportedly added another $25 billion to his fortune since the start of 2020 as coronavirus lockdowns have led millions of Americans to turn to Amazon for entertainment and sustenance, and the stock price of his company to grow accordingly. Amid skyrocketing revenues of $75.5 billion in Q1 2020 (up from $59.7 billion a year earlier), business media have been speculating that, if current trends continue, Bezos could become the world’s first trillionaire sometime in the next decade. So fantastical is Bezos’ Midas touch of profit-making that even his ex-wife MacKenzie Bezos, who became the third richest woman in the world after divorcing him in 2019 with a $35 billion settlement, that her wealth too has reportedly grown by $8.6 billion over the past four months alone.

Elon Musk, the eccentric Tesla and SpaceX CEO and tech billionaire who has intrigued netizens in recent weeks with obscure tweets casting doubt about the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic, accusing governments of ‘fascist’ restrictions and suggesting that the stock price of his own company is “too high,” has nevertheless managed to stay in the black, netting some $5 billion in new wealth, also mostly through stock gains, even as he promised to sell off all his real estate and almost all of his physical possessions to devote time to loftier goals including Mars exploration.

Who Will Be the Next Multibillionaire? As the coronavirus crisis continues to wreak havoc on global health care systems and the world economy, biotech companies around the world are rushing to develop a safe, effective coronavirus vaccine. On Wednesday, Kalorama Information, a New York-based market analytics firm, estimates that there are over 75 vaccine candidates around the world, five of them already undergoing clinical trials. Needless to say, whoever wins the ‘race’ to the vaccine will have the best chance of raking in the big bucks, as governments will begin buying up billions of doses for immunization programmes. Kalorama says based on previous experience with influenza vaccines, which generated $5.2 billion in revenues in 2018, COVID-19 could generate between $8 billion and $10 billion dollars in demand in the first full year of implementation alone. Among the major candidates are CanSino Biologics, a Chinese vaccine company already engaged in human trials, US biotech company Moderna, Inovio Pharmaceuticals (the company supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation), and the Shenzhen Geno-Immune Medical Institute, another Chinese entity which is working on two separate coronavirus-related vaccine preparations.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

Alyssa Milano has posted a snapshot of her family before a joint outing, and it all would have gone smoothly, but for her face mask, which turned out to be crocheted, and, expectedly, see-through.

Internet users instantly picked up on this small detail, taking note of the mask's style, remarking that the rest of the family rightly opted for more conventional material.

“So knitted face mask [sic] are going to protect you from COVID-19 Alyssa Milano you are a special kind of stupid #alyssamilano"", one fumed, with another weighing in:

“Haven't had a chance to pick up a mask but looks like this will do….."", the user wrote provocatively posting a picture of himself with a metal sieve pressed against his face.

Milano wasted no time attempting to hit back at the openly laughing netizens, justifying her choice:

“A**holes, mask has a carbon filter in it. So, yes, it might be crochet but totally safe"", she wrote, but most seemed to be unconvinced.

“Prove it"", one wrote, with another stressing he can see flesh rather than a whitish filter underneath the mask.

Can you show how they slot into the knitted mask?

“There is zero filter in that. We can see through it you dunce"", a third wrote.

“It's a special invisible filter"", one Twitterian assumed.

According to fresh John Hopkins University statistics, the US, which has started to gradually lift lockdown limitations, has seen over 1.62 million confirmed cases of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, topping the list in terms of numbers.

While some states have actively gone down the path of easing lockdowns, major CDC instructions for citizens remain in place, namely appropriate 6-foot social distancing and wearing face masks or respirators. Maintaining the social distancing rule ""remains important to slowing the spread of the virus"", the department stated on its website, adding that handmade masks crafted from household items, ""from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure"".",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

Most twitterati lambasted feminist writer Clementine Ford after she tweeted that COVID-19 ""isn't killing men fast enough"". She tweeted this bold thought to thousands of her followers, commenting on the story of a woman who had to abandon her lucrative job in favor of her husband, who could not handle full-time parenting, labeling the man ""absolutely pathetic"".

Despite not feeling for the hero of the story, netizens slammed Ford for being way too brutal, stressing that no mistakes or failures can excuse such things to say. Having received the wave of disproval, Ford only went on to remark how ""fragile"" men are if they react like that.

Honestly, the corona virus isn't killing men fast enough. — Clementine Ford 🧟‍♀️ (@clementine_ford) May 23, 2020

​Some noted that the tweet could be compared with racism, ableism and hate speech.

​Some pointed out that while Ford was apparently standing with women, she ended up insulting both genders.

This take makes no sense if you actually read the article which takes both men and women far more seriously than your callous response does. Imagine wishing single-motherhood on a woman in a time of Covid. The irony of this tweet is that it’s anti men AND women. — Chloé S. Valdary 📚 (@cvaldary) May 23, 2020

​Another sad irony of the incident is that several studies that have been conducted globally have shown that men tend to actually die from COVID-19 more often, although the potential to overcome the disease is the same for both genders. According to research by University College London, based on the data collected on 206,128 patients, men were twice as likely to require intensive care, and 60 percent more likely to die after being infected wIth COVID-19.

Facing strong backlash, Ford deleted the tweet, apologizing in a subsequent series of tweets for not ""framing her argument"" clearly and describing her tweet as ""poorly judged"". It was noted by many, however, that she remained committed to her assertion.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

“70%"", one opined, with others suggesting it could by anything from a suggestive ""69"" % to 99.5.

“Doesn’t matter the percentage because whatever it is, it’s the right one"", one gushed.

“Here is the 🔨hammer break the internet babe"", another praised Thorne’s update.

In the picture, like in a few previous ones, she likewise rocked a messy-chic hairstyle, showing off her newly dyed locks.

She also has several other projects in the works, both pre- and post-production - including soon-to-be released action thriller Infamous, which tells the story of the couple Arielle (Bella) and Dean (Jake Manley) venturing out on a bank-robbing rampage. The trailer came out last week, promising enough time for a fresh Bonnie and Clyde story to be appreciated by avid online cinema enthusiasts.

Infamous is set for a digital release, with screenings slated to take place in a number of “virtual cinemas”, on 12 June, as the anti-coronavirus measures are projected to continue.

US President Donald Trump - in an extraordinary manner - announced on Thursday that he does not have the coronavirus after having been tested that morning. He delivered the news in a dramatic way that left netizens pondering whether they actually understood his message. According to Trump, he ""tested very positively in another sense"". To be more precise, he ""tested positively toward negative"".

Trump described his test results as ""perfect"". In the end, the President finally clarified that he had again tested negative for the coronavirus.

Garcetti responded saying ""he's our commander in chief"" and that ""real men wear face masks”.

The LA mayor stressed that wearing masks is a gateway to ""increasing freedom"" and increased ""economic activity"", adding said that ""modeling"" the use of protective face covering is important for leaders.

One method the Trump administration appears to have employed is the encouragement of allies to abandon work with Chinese tech firms.

The US ambassador to Australia reaffirmed on Sunday that he has full confidence in the country’s ability to protect its telecommunications networks from potential Chinese espionage after the Trump administration threatened to react strongly to allies who join China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

The diplomatic gesture of solidarity by ambassador Arthur B. Culvahouse follows critical statements by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo over a $1 billion infrastructure deal signed between the Australian state of Victoria and China that could include work on 5G telecommunications systems by Beijing’s companies.

In an interview with Sky News on Sunday, May 24, Pompeo said that, “I don’t know the nature of these projects precisely,” but added that, “to the extent they have an adverse impact on our ability to protect telecommunications from our private citizens, or security networks for our defence and intelligence communities - we simply disconnect, we will simply separate.”

“We are going to preserve trust in networks for important information. We hope our friends and allies, especially our Five Eyes partners like Australia, do the same,” he added.

​The Five Eyes is the intelligence alliance between the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.

In what appeared to be a barely veiled threat, Pompeo also spoke of “some cost” to those nations who join the BRI and said that “every citizen of Australia should know that every one of those Belt and Road projects needs to be looked at incredibly closely.”

However, on Sunday afternoon, ambassador Culvahouse released a statement that apparently aimed at forestalling any possible rupture in relations with Australia following Pompeo’s comments.

“The United States has absolute confidence in the Australian Government's ability to protect the security of its telecommunications networks and those of its Five Eyes partners,” Mr Culvahouse said.

“We have made no secret of our concerns about 5G, and we commend Australia for its leadership on the issue. We are not aware that Victoria has engaged in any concrete projects under BRI, let alone projects impinging on telecommunications networks, which we understand are a federal matter. If there were telecommunications initiatives that we thought put the integrity of our networks at risk, of course we would have to take a close look at that, as the Secretary [Pompeo] suggested,” Mr Culvahouse elaborated.

The Trump administration has turned an increasingly critical gaze toward China since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Following a series of strongly worded threats, President Trump last week said that the US will “react strongly” if China imposes a new security law in Hong Kong aimed at curbing anti-Beijing protests.

Australia, along with the US, UK and other allies, has called for an international investigation into the origins of the coronavirus and whether China can ultimately be blamed for it. In response to bipartisan persistence within the Australian parliament for such an investigation, China’s ambassador to the country, Cheng Jingye, threatened that his country would boycott Australian products.

In response to Mr Jingye’s comments, officials from across the US congress signed a letter in which they proclaimed the US, “will always have Australia’s back.”",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

As the double shock of coronavirus restrictions and dipping oil prices have plunged the world into the worst economic crunch in decades, Muslims embarked on Eid al-Fitr celebrations on Sunday, marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan. In some locations, the festival, which traditionally unites whole families, relatives from far away, friends and neighbours, are set to be spent in a comparatively frugal way, given the authorities’ still effective stay-in instructions.

After a partial easing during Ramadan led to a sharp spike in infections, some countries - from Saudi Arabia to Egypt, Turkey, and Syria - moved to ban mass prayer gatherings, a highlight of the traditionally lavish celebrations, to limit the spread of the contagious COVID-19. For instance, Saudi Arabia, home to Islam's most holy sites, kicked off a five-day, round-the-clock curfew beginning on Saturday after infections more than quadrupled since Ramadan began to around 68,000 - the biggest tally among all Gulf countries.

At this unprecedented time, Eid prayers will be held at the two holy mosques in the cities of Mecca and Medina ""without worshippers"", a royal decree stated. Similarly, Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third holiest site, will be closed over Eid, but will reopen to worshippers only after the holiday, according to the governing body. Iran, which has seen the Middle East's deadliest corona flare-ups, has called on its citizens to avoid travel over Eid as it battles to keep tabs on COVID rates.

Health Minister Saeed Namaki said that the country had doubled down on its effort to avoid ""new peaks of the disease"" caused by people ""not respecting health regulations"".

Iran shut schools and places of worship and banned local travel over the Persian New Year holidays back in March, but the restrictions were recently eased, in the run-up to Eid, celebrated by both Sunnis and Shiites.

However, a great many, out of economic or personal reasons, voiced an intention to turn a deaf ear to the authorities’ instructions, with many issuing themselves fake passes in countries from Indonesia to Pakistan, to attend the conventional Eid fairs, or at least shop for gifts for their families, irrespective of fears corona rates would further soar.

""For over two months my children were homebound"", Ishrat Jahan, a mother of four, was quoted as saying by AFP, as she was seen at a bustling marketplace in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. ""This feast is for the kids, and if they can't celebrate it with new garments, there is no point in us working so hard throughout the year"", she added, as the country’s authorities are yet to decide on what measures to introduce throughout Eid.

Meanwhile, as many as 3,500 Tunisians who arrived back home just ahead of the holiday will have to spend it away from their families, under a two-week quarantine in airport hotels after arriving from abroad. Atef Maherzi, a doctor repatriated Tuesday from Saudi Arabia, said she would be feasting over Skype, with her husband meeting guests alone this time.

However, the dire times have inspired a group of Muslim comedians to launch a bit of visual entertainment, as mass gatherings have largely been given a no-go across nations.

Fourty Muslim performers from across the world agreed to host a virtual show on Sunday called ""The Socially Distant Eid Comedy Night”. Among Asian countries, Iran has been hit the most by the pandemic, with the total confirmed COVID-19 cases there topping 135,700, with India just behind (roughly 132,600), as of 24 May, per Johns Hopkins University estimates.",12.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0
