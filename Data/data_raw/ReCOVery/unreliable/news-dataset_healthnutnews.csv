Researchers from the University of Lethbridge said a study in April, printed in the online journal Preprints, showed that at least thirteen cannabis plants were high in CBD, which appeared to affect the ACE2 pathways that the virus uses to access the body. Olga Kovalchuk, one of the researchers, said:

“We were totally stunned at first, and then we were really happy.”

The results indicated hemp extracts high in CBD might help block proteins that provide a “gateway” for COVID-19 to enter host cells.

RELATED STORY:

Kovalchuk’s husband, Igor, suggested that cannabis could reduce the virus’s entry points by up to 70 percent, adding:

“Therefore, you have more chance to fight it. Our work could have a huge influence — there aren’t many drugs that have the potential of reducing infection by 70 to 80 percent.”

The researchers emphasized that more research was needed. Still, they said the study gave hope that cannabis, if proven to modulate the enzyme, “may prove a plausible strategy for decreasing disease susceptibility” as well as “become a useful and safe addition to the treatment of COVID-19 as an adjunct therapy.”

RELATED STORY:

The study suggested that cannabis could even be used to “develop easy-to-use preventative treatments in the form of mouthwash and throat gargle products,” with a “potential to decrease viral entry” through the mouth.

Olga said that study suggested that just a handful of more than 800 varities of sativa appeared to help. All were high in anti-inflammatory CBD — but low in THC, the part that produces the cannabis high. She added:

“The key thing is not that any cannabis you would pick up at the store will do the trick.”

RELATED STORY:

The study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, was carried out in partnership with Pathway Rx, a cannabis therapy research company, and Swysh Inc., a cannabinoid-based research company.

The researchers are exploring funding to continue their efforts to support scientific initiatives to address COVID-19. The research stated:

“While our most effective extracts require further large-scale validation, our study is crucial for the future analysis of the effects of medical cannabis on COVID-19.” “Given the current dire and rapidly evolving epidemiological situation, every possible therapeutic opportunity and avenue must be considered.”

In the latest animal trials of the vaccine, carried out on monkeys, all six primates in the test went on to catch deadly Covid-19, including three that had been vaccinated.

Dr William Haseltine, a former Harvard Medical School professor, said the trial led to the three vaccinated primates having the same amount of virus in their noses as the three non-vaccinated primates.

The results suggests the vaccine, which has received £90 million in government investment, may not halt the spread of the coronavirus.

Initial reports last week said the vaccine offered “some” immunity against the virus, as it stopped it from making its way into the lungs.

The vaccine is currently known as ChAdOx1 nCov-19, and is undergoing its first human clinical trial.

Nations have stepped up efforts to tackle the deadly virus, increasing funding all over the world.

Earlier today, a professor at Imperial College London, said it is unlikely a working vaccine will be ready this year.

Despite ministers claiming 30 million doses of the vaccine will be ready by September, the professor said people should not have false expectations.

Discussing the Oxford vaccine, Dr Haseltine wrote for Forbes:

“All of the vaccinated monkeys treated with the Oxford vaccine became infected when challenged. “There was no difference in the amount of viral RNA detected from (nasal secretions) in the vaccinated monkeys as compared to the unvaccinated animals. “Which is to say, all vaccinated animals were infected.”

Professor of Molecular Biology at Nottingham University, John Ball, warned:

“The amount of virus genome detected in the noses of the vaccinated and un-vaccinated monkeys was the same and this is concerning. “If this represents infectious virus and a similar thing occurs in humans, then vaccinated people can still be infected and shed large amounts of virus. “This could potentially spread to others in the community.”

She claimed that when she refused to “manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen,” she was given the choice to resign or be fired.

Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday he did not know Jones, but he insisted her termination was over her “insubordination” — not over any refusal to alter state data.

During a press conference Wednesday afternoon with Vice President Mike Pence, DeSantis went further, disputing nearly every claim Jones made in recent interviews.

“One, she is not a data scientist. She is somebody that’s got a degree in journalism, communication and geography. She is not involved in collating any data, she does not have the expertise to do that, she is not an epidemiologist, she is not the chief architect of our web portal. That is another false statement,” the governor said. “She was putting data on the portal, which the scientists didn’t believe was valid data. So, she didn’t listen to people who were her superiors, she had many people above her in the chain of command. And so then she was dismissed because of that.”

Then, DeSantis said Jones is under “active criminal charges” in Florida, which includes cyber-stalking and cyber-sexual harassment.

“I have a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment,” the governor said, adding that he was asking the Department of Health to explain how she had remained employed despite the charges.

Records in the Leon County Clerk of Court website show Rebekah Jones was involved in cases matching what the governor said. In October 2017 and in June 2019, a temporary injunction for stalking was filed against her in Leon County. Those cases are closed.

In July 2019, a stalking case was filed by the state of Florida against Jones. The case remains open.

FOX 13 has reached out to Jones, but we have not heard back.

FOX 13 asked the governor’s office what questionable data Jones was putting online and his spokesperson offered this reply:

“Rebeka [sic] Jones acted as if she had ownership of the Department of Health Dashboard website and disregarded the direction given to her by subject matter experts such as the Senior Epidemiologists, Senior Data Analysts and supervisors. She was resistant to publishing data on the website she disagreed with going against the judgement of the epidemiologists, senior data analysts and supervisors. Event Date is a field that can be queried on the dashboard that marks the beginning of the epidemiological investigation which is based on self-reporting of information that is not medically certified. The science and public health experts believe the best information is the actual clinical diagnosis of the disease verified by COVID-19 diagnostic testing,” Helen Aguirre Ferre wrote.

Meanwhile, some Democratic senators began demanding an investigation into Jones’ claims about data manipulation after her claims got national attention Tuesday.

“We are making public policy decisions based on that information,” state Sen. Lori Berman of Boynton Beach said. “If it is being falsified, we need to know that.”

“Our data is available. Our data is transparent. Any insinuation otherwise is just typical partisan narrative,” DeSantis countered Wednesday, pointing to Florida’s comparatively low mortality rate.

“We’ve succeeded and I think that people just don’t want to recognize it because it challenges their narrative, it challenges their assumption. So they gotta try and find a boogeyman,” he added. “Maybe it’s that there are black helicopters circling the Department of Health. If you believe that, I’ve got a bridge in Brooklyn I’d like to sell you.”

The British government has pledged to invest $24 million to support teams at Oxford University joined in the global race to find a vaccine. However, following the publication of detailed trial results last week, it was discovered that the vaccine failed to prevent monkeys from catching the COVID-19 virus.

The vaccine, called ChAdOx1, was trialed in rhesus macaque monkeys, exposing six of them to COVID-19. A control group of three non-vaccinated monkeys was also infected. Then, both the immunized and non-immunized monkeys were monitored for seven days for signs of developing COVID-19.

This has led to experts doubting the vaccine’s effectiveness, should it be approved for more extensive use among the population, and in particular about whether it will be able to prevent the spread of the virus between affected individuals.

RELATED STORY:

Former Harvard Medical School professor Dr. William Haseltine, who had a pivotal role in the development of early HIV/Aids treatments, said:

“It is crystal clear that the vaccine did not provide sterilizing immunity to the virus challenge, the gold standard for any vaccine. It may provide partial protection.” “All of the vaccinated monkeys treated with the Oxford vaccine became infected when challenged, as judged by recovery of virus genomic RNA from nasal secretions.”

RELATED STORY:

He wrote in an article on Forbes:

“There was no difference in the amount of viral RNA detected from this site in the vaccinated monkeys as compared to the unvaccinated animals. Which is to say, all vaccinated animals were infected.”

Dr. Haseltine added that although all of the monkeys were infected with the virus, none suffered from pneumonia, which suggests the vaccine could help fight the severity of COVID-19, which may give hope to some.

Dr. Penny Ward, a visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London, said:

“It is helpful to see that monkeys vaccinated with this SARS-CoV-2 vaccine did not have any evidence of enhanced lung pathology and that, despite some evidence of upper respiratory tract infection by SARS COV2 after high viral load virus challenge, monkeys given the vaccine did not have any evidence of pneumonia.”

The CitizenGO petition is addressed to the heads of G20 nations, and reads:

“We humbly ask you to join U.S. President Donald J. Trump to stop sending funds to the World Health Organization.”1

According to Breitbart, the appeal says that the W.H.O.’s relationship with China is unfavorable, stating:

“that it supports and disseminates the false and incomplete information released by Communist China regarding the seriousness of COVID19” and “the W.H.O. internal decision-making and management processes are not subject to direct control by taxpayers.”1

Furthermore, the appeal notes that during the peak of the spread of Chinese coronavirus, W.H.O. has continued to use contributions paid with public funds for promoting abortion worldwide as a human right, supporting the legalization of prostitution, forcing doctors to perform sex reassignment surgery on children, and disseminating a curriculum for global sexuality standards that teaches masturbation to small children.

RELATED S TORY:

RELATED STORY:

Currently, Italy is the seventh-largest national funder of the W.H.O., behind the U.S.A., China, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, and France, according to the appeal, which also states:

“To compensate for the loss of funds from U.S. contributions, W.H.O. and its ideological allies are calling for an increase in voluntary donations from other countries. And the G20 countries are at the top of the list.” “We don’t need a global ‘health’ organization that pumps billions out of our society every year to harm children,” it declares. “And President Trump’s plan to cut funding to the W.H.O. offers us a real opportunity to start seeing the end of their global agenda, that same agenda that does nothing but trample on human dignity and its true value.”1

If President Trump follows through with his promise to stop U.S. funding to W.H.O., the organization will suffer the loss of $419 million, which accounts for 15 percent of its annual budget, the appeal notes.

RELATED STORY:

On Monday, President Trump warned the World Health Organization that it will permanently lose U.S. funding unless it commits to “major substantive improvements within the next 30 days.”1

When Trump suspended U.S. funding of the U.N. subsidiary, he cited its role in “mismanaging and covering up” the global spread of the coronavirus, saying at the White House:

“They’re a puppet of China, they’re China-centric to put it nicer. They gave us a lot of bad advice.”1

Trump wrote to W.H.O. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus indicating he will reconsider America’s support of the organization only after numerous improvements are made, first and foremost dropping ties with China. Breitbart reports the letter said:

“It is clear the repeated missteps by you and your organization in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly for the world.”1

One such city is Nashville, Tennessee, where the fairgrounds are being used by the city in an attempt to quash an outbreak among homeless residents. Dr. Alex Jahangir, chairman of the city’s coronavirus task force, said everyone who has tested positive can be ordered into quarantine. He added:

“Everyone is entitled to come and go as they want, typically, but in the fairgrounds situation we wanted to make sure that people who are positive stayed in the ill parts of the shelter — period.”1

Jahangir said the vast majority of people who tested positive in Nashville have cooperated with officials, so “formal quarantines” have been unnecessary. However, the city has the option of using a legally enforceable quarantine order whenever necessary, and recently had to do so after a COVID-19 patient jumped a fence and fled the Nashville Fairgrounds.

Health officials informed the man he could not leave until he was cleared, but he jumped a fence and left anyway, according to the arrest affidavit, which was the first of its kind in the city. The man was stopped and arrested by Metro Nashville Parks police by a city cemetery nearly two miles from where he had been quarantined.

The arrest highlights the difference between citizens advised to remain at home and those ordered into quarantine. The mayor of Nashville has instructed residents to stay home as much as possible. However, those who test positive for coronavirus can be ordered into quarantine, which police can enforce.

RELATED STORY:

In addition to Nashville, commissioners in Palm Beach County, Florida unanimously approved a plan to shelter the homeless in the old Palm Beach County Detention Center near the South Florida Fairgrounds.

Residents in the area sounded off, expressing frustration at being left out of the conversation. One such resident, Blair English, said:

“We are worried about having up to 125 homeless people right down the road from us.”2

RELATED STORY:

County leaders say the old detention center is a safe place for the homeless to lay their heads. They’ll have access to job training and medical care. Palm Beach County Mayor Dave Kerner added:

“When folks come to the county commission and say ‘I don’t want this person in my backyard,’ well they are not going to be in your backyard. But they are in other people’s backyard right now and they are not being well taken care of by the government and that’s not acceptable.”2

Palm Beach County leaders made it very clear that people who opt out of using the shelter won’t be allowed to continue camping at parks, while advocates for the homeless feel for the plan to work, it’s going to come down to how it’s presented to the people who will use it.

Homeless resident David Thorton Jr., like dozens of others living in tents at John Prince Park, says he’s thrilled to hear about the access to resources to help him get back on his feet, but he’s not completely sold on the plan. He said:

“If it looks like a jail… I feel like they are just trying to lock up the homeless because they think that we are lower than scum. I understand that it’s not meant to be [a] luxurious thing, but if it’s like a jail that’s kind of pointless. It’s making us look like we are ex-cons and stuff.”2

The project, led by Neil Johnson, professor of physics at George Washington University, who also heads a new initiative in Complexity and Data Science, analyzed Facebook communities containing close to 100 million individuals. The study grouped them into color-coded “clusters” to chart how members interact, shift, and share links, and illustrates how differing stances on vaccination have evolved and competed over time.

For the study, investigators developed an innovative tool to map vaccine conversations among 100 million Facebook users during the height of the 2019 measles outbreak. Johnson noted:

“There is a new world war online surrounding trust in health expertise and science, particularly with misinformation about COVID-19, but also distrust in big pharmaceuticals and governments. Nobody knew what the field of battle looked like, though, so we set to find out.”1

RELATED STORY:

While vaccine supporters (coded “Blue”) outnumber users with anti-vaccine views (coded “Red”) on Facebook, the platform has nearly three times as many anti-vaccination communities. According to the study, that makes it far more likely that their views will reach undecided people (coded “Green”).

RELATED STORY:

Researchers also found that pro-vaccine communities may be putting their focus in the wrong place. Researchers suggested that those concentrating on larger anti-vaccination communities might miss chances to influence medium-sized communities that are growing under the radar.

The study also noted that anti-vaccination groups offer lots of content about vaccines and other proven health treatments, such as safety concerns, conspiracy theories, or individual choice. With about 3 billion people using the social media platform, this content increases their chance of influencing Facebook users who are undecided.

Pro-vaccination communities typically focused their messages on the public health benefits of vaccination, according to the study. In a university press release, Johnson said:

“We thought we would see major public health entities and state-run health departments at the center of this online battle, but we found the opposite. They were fighting off to one side, in the wrong place.” “Instead of playing whack-a-mole with a global network of communities that consume and produce [mis]information, public health agencies, social media platforms and governments can use a map like ours and an entirely new set of strategies to identify where the largest theaters of online activity are and engage and neutralize those communities peddling in misinformation so harmful to the public.”1

RELATED STORY:

Under present conditions, one predictive model used by the scientists observed that anti-vaccination support could reach dominance in approximately ten years. Johnson said:

“This is now a war over hearts and minds. The growing success of Red lies in the fact that Red now offers lots of attractive ‘flavors’ of health-related narrative, such as questioning role of big pharma, government, civil liberties, freedom of choice for their kids etc. By contrast, Blue is like vanilla, one flavor of message.”1

Johnson has continued to monitor the trends during the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak, and says targeting undecided individuals is critical. Referencing the cluster color coding, he explained:

“With COVID-19, this is a perfect storm since Blue itself is not 100 percent sure about the science. Since the start of COVID-19, we already see Green communities in this picture turning Red. “The implication is that instead of trying to convince Red, which is very hard and may backfire to make them stronger, Blue should focus on intelligently engaging Green. Like in an insurgency, the battle should be for hearts and minds. Greens are much larger numerically in total, and could tip the balance away from herd immunity if not enough Greens get vaccinated against COVID-19, when a vaccine appears. “Though the focus is on vaccines and COVID-19, the same applies for other scientific distrust, including climate change. Don’t fight the Reds, engage the Greens.”1

With many beaches closed in Florida during the coronavirus pandemic, researchers see less plastic and less waste. There are fewer people and vehicles on the beach projecting artificial light; thus there is less disorientation for emerging hatchlings, according to David Godfrey, Executive Director for the Sea Turtle Conservancy.

Because of these factors, sea turtles can build nests without any disruptions.

Godfrey said that nesting season for leatherback turtles, the largest of all sea turtles, is underway right now, mostly in the central-east and southeast coast of Florida. They nest in fewer numbers than the loggerheads, who arrive in May. Later in the summer months is when green turtles will come.

It takes approximately 60 days for sea turtle eggs to incubate and for hatchlings to emerge, Godfrey said. Many disturbing things can happen to their nests when humans take over their beaches. They trample and dig up the turtle’s nests and harm them with artificial light.

RELATED STORY:

RELATED STORY:

With an inactive beach, the turtles can carry on the way nature intended. Godfrey said:

“I think there is a strong likelihood that we will see decreased human-caused impacts on sea turtle nesting this year, which is a rare silver lining to this global pandemic. It’s premature to try and use numbers to demonstrate what we all think and hope is happening. The numbers just aren’t there yet. I hear that the season is going pretty well so far, it’s off to a good start.”

Less foot traffic improves the reptiles situation right now, but what will happen when the beaches reopen, and the sea turtles’ eggs begin to hatch? Leatherback sea turtles will see hatchlings toward the end of April. Godfrey said researchers are working in uncharted territory, and only time will tell.

RELATED STORY:

Dr. Justin Perrault, Director of Research at the Loggerhead Marinelife Center, said his team does worry that when the beaches reopen, there may be an influx of people flocking to the beach because they were stuck indoors for an extended period. He added:

“It just depends on the behavior of people after the closures end. And if there’s an excessive amount on the beaches, then more people means more interaction with turtles, which can be negative if they don’t follow the rules.”

The city of Jacksonville announced beaches and parks in Duval County would open Friday with certain restrictions starting at 5 pm, according to the city’s Twitter page.

Perrault said when people do return, it’ll be essential for them to to keep lights off whenever possible, maintain distance from marine animals, and leave the beach the way they found it. He added:

“Remember that we’re not the only species out there.”

Ranking at the top is Yosemite National Park. With its dazzling 1,189 sq. mile (3,080 sq. km.) park teeming with massive waterfalls, unique ecological zones, and over 800 miles of trails nestled in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains, the park is one of the most unique and beautiful places in the Western hemisphere.

However, during the spring and summer, Yosemite can often resemble any other tourist trap. With parking lots crammed with buses and cars, trails spilling over with swarms of hikers, and the park’s scenic majesty cluttered with snap-happy selfie-takers, it’s often anything but the idyllic escape from society that you would expect.

RELATED STORY:

But with the coronavirus shutting down most national parks, some of the most amazing displays of Mother Nature have become off-limits to us, including Yosemite—that is, unless we’re willing to settle for the webcams scattered across the enormous park.

However, the closure has also resulted in much of the park’s landscape reverting back to its natural state.

In a video recently shared by Yosemite National Park, the park can be seen entirely free of tourists. The iconic park is instead teeming with native residents living their lives as if they never encountered us pesky humans.

RELATED STORY:

RELATED STORY:

Young deer can be seen strolling along normally car-choked roads in a carefree manner, coyotes peacefully hang out, and bobcats slink about in the underbrush while the sound of cascading waterfalls and babbling brooks can be heard in the background.

The video’s post reads:

“While so much has changed for humans in recent weeks, it’s reassuring to see that nature carries on as it always has. Spring seems to be slowly creeping into the valley, the sun finally emerging after a week or two of rain and snow. Waterfalls are gradually picking up momentum, and wildlife is becoming more active, perhaps enjoying having the park mostly to themselves. Relax with us for a moment as we share a peek into Yosemite Valley during the current park closure.”

Yosemite was one of the first parks to be shut down as local health authorities urgently advised the measure to be taken to slow the CoViD-19 pandemic. From March 20 onwards, the few humans residing on the park have been its essential rangers and staffers.

RELATED STORY:

Before parks were subject to lockdown, many of them offered discounted entry fees so that people could exercise and enjoy the park while maintaining their safe social distance from one another. Health officials soon realized that with most other recreational spaces being closed, the crowds who flocked to the park would be a massive public health liability resulting in the park’s indefinite closure.

Of course, the park won’t always remain closed—nor would anyone want that to be the case. The foundations for the National Park system were laid in the early 20th century by President Theodore Roosevelt, who was concerned about the creeping over-exploitation of the natural resources of North America, eradication of its wildlife, and disappearance of its natural beauty. During his presidency, Roosevelt established 230 million acres of public land that was meant to be conserved for public use and enjoyment.
