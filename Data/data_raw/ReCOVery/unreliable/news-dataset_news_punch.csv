Traditionally, an official commissioned portrait of the last president is unveiled in an East Room ceremony by the current president, who makes polite remarks about his predecessor before adding the painting to the collection of portraits of former presidents.

But according to NBC News, however, neither Trump nor former President Barack Obama is interested in participating in this tradition that goes back decades.

But these two are not just any presidents: They have had a highly contentious public relationship.

WesternJournal report: Recently, Obama took the opportunity of video commencement addresses to take shots at Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

For his part, Trump has been vocal about the Obama administration’s role in unmasking the identity of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn in a scandal dubbed “Obamagate.”

“You’ve got a president who’s talking about putting the previous one in legal jeopardy, to put it nicely,” presidential historian Michael Beschloss told NBC News.

“We have not seen a situation like that in history,” he said. “It takes antipathy of a new president for a predecessor to a new level.”

Despite how Beschloss described it, people close to the matter reportedly confirmed that Obama would not be interested in taking part in the ceremony as long as Trump was president, meaning the former president’s portrait could remain absent until 2025 if Trump is re-elected.

Trump apparently wasn’t disappointed to nix the event either, according to those same sources.

Still, liberals are furious at the supposed attack on Obama’s honor.

NBC and MSNBC legal analyst Maya Wiley blamed the absence of the ceremony on — you guessed it — Trump’s racism.

“So #Trump, who stoked ‘birtherism’ lunacy v the first Black #POTUS, was sued 4 house discrimination & vilified ppl of color won’t hang #Obama portrait. Anyone surprised?” she wrote on Twitter.

Anyone surprised? “White House portrait ceremony may be the latest casualty of the political divide” https://t.co/tVD61hVbLl — Maya Wiley (@mayawiley) May 19, 2020

In a move that was as predictable as the sunrise, CNN also implied that Trump’s supposed snub was racially motivated, but it seems at the very least to be a mutual decision if not completely one-sided on the part of Obama.

The Obamas had unveiled their Smithsonian portraits in 2018, which were widely ridiculed at the time for their stylized portrayals of the couple, but the official White House presidential portrait is a completely separate commissioned work of art.

According to The Hill, the former president and first lady secured and signed an artist as per the usual procedure for the official portrait, but the process stopped there as neither Obama has yet to sit for their paintings.

If that report is true, it may indicate the decision was mainly Obama’s because, after all, a painting that does not exist cannot be unveiled.

“Finally! Obama makes a decision that is good for America,” actor James Woods tweeted.

Regardless of who was responsible, Obama’s media cronies are always concerned about his legacy, often citing the ridiculous myth that his presidency was scandal-free in an attempt to bolster his image, so blaming Trump plays well into their established narrative.

On the other hand, it is fun to imagine Obama, a president who relished being in the company of celebrities, to edge his way into their spotlight, mulling whether it would be better to forgo his portrait ceremony to “rob” Trump of that honor if that is, in fact, what happened.

Regardless of how this situation came about, it is satisfying to know that Obama’s portrait will not have a place in the White House as long as Trump is president.

That must be infuriating to the leftists who treasure Obama as their dear leader, and would make Trump’s potential re-election a doubly painful prospect.

And surely, Trump and his supporters wouldn’t want it any other way.",0,Very low,Extreme right,USA,0

According to the mainstream media, Joe Biden is surging in the polls and the 2020 presidential race is all but over. But as usual, what is happening on the ground is telling a very different story than polling, and it could also be a preview of the coming 2020 election.

Republicans, despite the polling, are winning races across the country.

WesternJournal report: Mike Garcia, a Republican endorsed by Trump, flipped California’s 25th Congressional District last week, several months after disgraced Democratic Rep. Katie Hill resigned.

Tom Tiffany, another Trump-backed candidate, won Wisconsin’s Seventh Congressional District, fighting back Democrats hoping to take the seat following the resignation of former GOP Rep. Sean Duffy.

And now we turn to Northern Virginia, where voters in two communities took to the polls this week and sent incumbent Democrats packing in an apparent referendum on far-left Gov. Ralph Northam and other state and local Democrats.

Republicans showed up in large numbers, and now three Democratic incumbents on the city council are out of a job in the city of Staunton, according to the Daily Caller.

The community, which twice voted for former President Barack Obama, ousted Democrats Erik Curren, Ophie Kier and James Harrington.

Republicans Mark Robertson, Amy Darby and Steve Claffey will replace the Democrats on the council, according to WHSV, while incumbent Republican Andrea Oakes won re-election — allowing conservative candidates to sweep the city council electoral contests and giving Republicans a majority on the council.

Voters in the neighboring city of Waynesboro also elected two Republicans, Lana Williams and Bruce Allen, which gives that city council a Republican majority as well.

Chris Graham, writing for the area outlet the Augusta Free Press, noted the shocking election results in Staunton, where the three incumbent Democrats nearly doubled their overall vote total from 2016, yet still all managed to lose.

According to Graham, Democrats turned out in unusually large numbers, but Republicans brought on a tidal wave.

“Staunton City Council incumbents Ophie Kier, James Harrington and Erik Curren all outperformed their 2016 vote totals in their 2020 re-election runs,” he wrote.

“Democrats got their voters out better than they have in a May cycle in years,” Graham wrote. “Republicans got turnout more akin to, not quite a presidential year, but approaching gubernatorial.”

“A city that voted for Barack Obama, twice, voted for Hillary Clinton, voted for Terry McAuliffe and Ralph Northam, even gave a solid majority to Jennifer Lewis in her 2018 congressional run against Ben Cline, is now controlled by Republicans,” Graham added,

“I’m rarely shocked by something that happens in politics, but I have to admit, I didn’t see this one happening.”

As lawmakers in Virginia have threatened civil liberties, first with gun-grabbing proposals and now with prolonged draconian lockdowns amid the coronavirus, voters in a Democratic stronghold sent a strong message.

“The conservative slates in both cities ran as a unit and highlighted the Second Amendment as a key issue in their campaigns,” Graham wrote.

“Bottom line is that the strategies worked, flipping both from D to R, but the change in Staunton is stunning almost beyond words.”

Those in Virginia join Californians and Wisconsinites in sending a similar message to Democrats, and all in the same month.

Voters have stood up for their rights during a time when Democrats have shown us just how vulnerable those rights can be.

National polls tell us it’s time to start writing a eulogy for the Republican Party.

The reality seems to be that Republicans are energized from coast to coast, and they are ready to stand against Democrats and the tyrannical big government overreach that liberals support.",0,Very low,Extreme right,USA,0

The former Vice President was accused of racism after his interview with Charlamagne tha God in which he defended his poor record with the black community.

“I tell you if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black,” Biden told the black co-host, right to his face.

Later in the afternoon, Biden was forced to walk back his offensive remarks, but refused to outright apologize for them.

“I’ve never ever taken the African-American community for granted, had their support … I shouldn’t have been such a wise guy. I shouldn’t have been so cavalier,” Biden said later that day. “I don’t take it for granted at all, and no one, no one should have to vote for any party, based on their race or religion or background.”

Foxnews.com reports: Still, Biden’s remarks dominated the conversation on social media with the hashtags #YouAintBlack and #JoeBidenIsARacist trending on Twitter.

Fox News and MSNBC covered the dust-up throughout the day. ABC News, CBS News and NBC News all addressed the controversy on their evening programs.

However, CNN’s lack of coverage throughout the day was called out by critics.

“Fascinating to watch how the left-leaning cable networks have covered Biden’s ‘you ain’t black’ comment. MSNBC has discussed it nearly every hour… CNN hasn’t mentioned it once,” former CNN digital producer-turned-media critic Steve Krakauer tweeted.

George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley pointed out the “crickets” coming from CNN. In the afternoon, Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called out the network for going hours without mentioning the controversy.

“It’s been over 5 HOURS since Biden told Black people they ‘ain’t black’ if they support @realDonaldTrump. How many times has CNN mentioned his bigoted comment on air? ZERO. Unreal,” McDaniel tweeted.

She later slammed the anti-Trump network for waiting until “12 hours” to mention Biden’s “bigoted remarks,” tweeting, “We all know that if a Republican made a similar comment, CNN would have reworked their entire day of programming to feature 9-person panels condemning it. The bias is unbelievable.”

“When you take into account how both MSNBC covered this repeatedly and Biden decided to issue a mea culpa, you’re left with no conceivable excuse for CNN other than they did so on purpose,” NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck told Fox News. “Instead, they decided that trashing the administration for allowing houses of worship to reopen and gleefully touting negative hydroxychloroquine headlines were jobs one and two.”

Houck continued: “CNN has their insane way of going about their newsgathering, presentation and selection, but ignoring a story like this for hours and hours reminds us that their demands that other news organizations act like they do should not only be dismissed but laughed out of the room.”

CNN didn’t offer a full on-air report of Biden’s remarks until the end of the 7 p.m. ET hour, when anchor Erin Burnett spoke with Charlamagne tha God about the interview, making it the last major news network to report on Biden’s comments. It had articles published on the website earlier in the day.

Instead, the network spent much of the day offering critical coverage of the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak.

Jordan Chariton, co-founder of the progressive media outlet Status Coup, said CNN’s lack of coverage of the controversy is because the network “has been in the tank for Biden for over a year.”

“They dragged their feet on many stories related to him including him lying on being arrested in apartheid South Africa on his way to meeting Nelson Mandela,” Chariton told Fox News. “Outlets like CNN are protectors of the status quo and as such, they will always try and cover up bad stories for candidates like Biden rather than cover and challenge him.”

This isn’t the first time CNN’s on-air coverage has raised eyebrows. On Thursday, CNN bizarrely spent over 100 minutes covering President Trump’s refusal to wear a mask at the Ford plant. Meanwhile, the network spent just 15 minutes combined from Monday through Thursday covering the growing nursing-home controversy plaguing Democrat New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

A CNN insider told Fox News that while Trump should have worn the mask, the network is putting an undue emphasis on “what’s not important.”

“I don’t know why they focus on things like this when there are certainly more important things to focus on,” the network source said.

The insider knocked CNN, suggesting that if Trump found the cure for the coronavirus without wearing a mask, him not wearing the mask would become “the story” on the network.

Cuomo has largely gotten a pass from CNN, as the network has largely refrained from airing critical coverage of the Democrat governor. On Wednesday, he appeared for his 10th interview with his brother, “Cuomo Prime Time” anchor Chris Cuomo.

As in previous interviews, the CNN anchor made no mention of the growing death toll in New York nursing homes. Yet, he did manage to squeeze in some prop comedy, mocking the governor’s televised coronavirus test examination with overly-sized cotton swabs while poking fun at the size of his nose.

“CNN’s coverage of Andrew Cuomo has been consistent with much of the media: focus on the glowing verbiage and ignore the catastrophic mishandling of nursing homes that led to thousands of deaths,” Cornell Law School professor and media critic William A. Jacobson told Fox News.

“This problem is compounded by a serious conflict of interest arising from the relationship between Chris Cuomo, one of CNN’s highest-profile news personalities, and his brother the governor,” Jacobson added. “Chris Cuomo should not be allowed to cover or comment on air about his brother, and CNN should appoint someone to monitor and review coverage of Andrew Cuomo to prevent this conflict of interest from bleeding over to other news coverage.”

Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean told “Tucker Carlson Tonight” Thursday that Cuomo’s failed nursing-home policy should be “one of the biggest” stories of the year after both of her parents-in-law lost their lives to the coronavirus.

“I have not seen the coverage of this,” an emotional Dean said. “Twenty percent of our lost loved ones are from nursing homes … because Governor Cuomo and several other governors forced COVID-recovering patients into nursing homes.”

Dean, who rarely comments on political issues, felt compelled to speak out after watching Wednesday night’s CNN interview between the two playful Cuomo brothers.

“The fact that I am seeing, last night, him … making fun, inappropriate jokes and insensitive jokes, cruel jokes … make no mistake,” Dean said, “I am glad that Chris Cuomo has recovered from COVID because he apparently did have it. And I’m glad that their family is well, but my family is not well. And that is not something to joke about.”",0,Very low,Extreme right,USA,0
