âThereâs a lot of documented information about cannabis in cancer, cannabis in inflammation, anxiety, obesity and whatnot,â said Dr. Igor Kovalchuk, who co-authored the study alongside his wife, Dr. Olga Kovalchuck, and a team of other researchers from Lethbridge. âWhen COVID-19 started, Olga had the idea to revisit our data, and see if we can utilize it for COVID.â

âIt was like a joker card, you know, coronavirus. It just mixes up everybodyâs plans,â Olga added.

The Kovalchuksâ have been working with cannabis since 2015, using varieties from around the world to create new hybrids and develop extracts that demonstrate certain therapeutic properties.

CBD reduces available ACE2 receptors for the virus to latch on to

For the study, published in pre-peer review server Preprints, the researchers partnered with cannabis therapy research company Pathway Rx — of which Igor KovalchuckÂ is the CEO —Â andÂ cannabinoid-based research company Swysh.

The team created 3D tissue modelsÂ withÂ human oral,Â mucociliary and intestinal tissues and tested them with different samples of high CBD extracts. The extracts were low in tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. (Related: CBDÂ vs. coronavirus? Potential natural remedies that promote immunity.)

With this setup, the researchers thenÂ observed the effect that the extracts had on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor that the virus uses to enter human cells.

The results of the researchersâ tests demonstrated that the extracts helped reduce the number of these receptors that the coronavirus could use to âhijackâ host cells.

âA number of them have reduced the number of [ACE2] receptors by 73 percent, the chance of it getting in is much lower,â stated Igor.

âIf they can reduce the number of receptors, thereâs much less chance of getting infected,â he added.

In addition to ACE2, the researchers also looked into other receptors such as transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), which allows the virus to invade cells more easily and multiply quickly.

âImagine a cell being a large building,â explained Kovalchuk to CTV News.Â âCannabinoids decrease the number of doors in the building by, say, 70 percent, so it means the level of entry will be restricted. So, therefore, you have more chance to fight it.â

Clinical trials still needed but exploring therapeutic options is important

The researchersâ early findings indicate that the CBD extracts could be used in inhalers, mouthwash and throat gargle products for both clinical and home treatment.

However, they say that people looking for CBD extracts to fight the coronavirus wonât be able to do so at their local dispensaries yet. They state that the current medical cannabis and CBD products, while helpful for a lot of ailments, are not designed to treat or prevent infection from COVID-19.

âThe key thing is not that any cannabis you would pick up at the store will do the trick,â said Olga.

With this in mind, the researchers are now actively pursuing clinical trials. They stressed that their data is already based on human tissue models, so these trials are a natural next step.

They also highlight the importance of exploring every therapeutic option when it comes to fighting the coronavirus.

âGiven the current dire and rapidly developing epidemiological situation, every possible therapeutic opportunity and avenue needs to be considered.â

âWe need to bring it to the people,â says Olga. âWe need to fight the beast.â

Furthermore,Â some of these outbreaks may be a sign that the coronavirus is mutating.

As of press time, the world has over five million confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 333,212 deaths.

In America, states such as Texas, New Jersey and Idaho areÂ already in the first phase of their reopening programs. In Europe, countries such as Germany, Denmark, France, Spain and Italy are also easing their restrictions. With these in mind, itÂ looks like these countries are finally starting to come out of the disasterÂ theyâve been experiencing these past few months.

However, the same cannot be said for Asia.

Second outbreak in China a possible sign that the coronavirus is mutating

In Chinaâs northeastern region,Â which borders both Russia and North Korea, over 46 new cases have been reported in the provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang, over the past two weeks. In these provinces, lockdown measures were implemented once again to control the spread of the virus.

TheÂ symptoms in these new cases, however, indicate that the virus behaves differently.

Doctors attending to these new cases have stated that theÂ disease manifests differentlyÂ in the new cases than regular coronavirus cases. The main characteristic that health workersÂ observed is that patients take longer to test negative. This suggests that people are infected for longer periods of time.

Furthermore, the patients in this cluster of coronavirus cases only experience lung damage from the virus. In comparison, patients in Wuhan, the initialÂ epicenter of the pandemic,Â sometimes suffer multiple organ damage across the intestines, kidney and heart.

In addition, the patients have a longer presymptomatic period, that is, the duration of time from when a person is infected to when symptoms first appear. In Wuhan, on the other hand, patients would manifest symptoms after one to two weeks.

This delay before the patients become symptomatic makes it difficult for authorities to catch cases early and prevent the virusâs spread.

âThe longer period during which infected patients show no symptoms has created clusters of family infections,â said Qiu Haibo, one of Chinaâs top critical care physicians, during an interview on state television.

TheÂ observations of healthcare workers in the area suggest that there is still a lot of uncertainty over how the coronavirus is manifesting. This makes it difficult for Chinaâs healthcare system to react, as it is already struggling to contain this new cluster of infections.

ComplicatingÂ is thatÂ these new cases of the disease are not being reported by authorities, even as they implement strict lockdown measures.

Listen to theÂ Health Ranger ReportÂ as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how China is manipulating their infection numbers to hide their collapse.

Meanwhile, in Wuhan, several new infections were reported. This is the cityâs first new cluster of infections ever since its extremely strict quarantine measures were relaxed. The new cases were discovered in a single residential community, ending a 35-day streak of no new infections. In response, the city is conducting blanket testing on its residents.

Other parts of Asia experiencing renewed outbreaks

After being able to handle their initial waveÂ of coronavirus infections, other parts of Asia are also experiencing renewed outbreaks. (Related:Â 51 Recovered patients inÂ South KoreaÂ test positive AGAIN for coronavirus.)

Similar cases are happening in Singapore and South Korea. In Singapore, one new infection cluster was discovered after a 73-year old Singaporean man died from the coronavirus in a nursing home.

After an outbreak of cases linked to a nightclub in South Korea, the countryâs government acted quickly by testing 35,000 people who had links to the cluster. Over 100 people who went to this particular nightclub have tested positive.

2,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-23-trump-orders-churches-worship-to-reopen.html,Natural News,2020-05-23,['Arsenio Toledo'],President Trump orders houses of worship to reopen … threatens to override states that refuse,https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2020/05/Coronavirus-Trump-Briefing-Covid-19.jpg,"(Natural News) President Donald Trump has declared places of worship, such as churches, synagogues and mosques, as essential services and has called on governors to allow these religious institutions to reopen. The president has also said he will âoverrideâ the decisions of any state leaders who don’t agree to reopen churches.

âThe ministers, pastors, rabbis, imams and other faith leaders will make sure their congregations are safe as they gather and pray,â said Trump at a hastily scheduled appearance Friday in the briefing room of the White House.

The president’s order comes as he criticizes the “hypocrisy” of some governors who have allowed liquor stores and abortion clinics to remain open while keeping houses of worship under lockdown.

âItâs not right, so Iâm correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential,â Trump told reporters.

In response to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, most houses of worship in the U.S. have closed their doors for the time being, with some providing virtual services. However, others have tried to continue with normal services and bringing their congregations together, which has prompted some pushback from local authorities. (Related: Churchgoers vow they would rather DIE than skip services during coronavirus lockdown.)

State and local officials critical of order

Trump made no mention of how exactly he would compel governors and state authorities to reopen religious institutions. Currently, legal experts are saying that the president has no power to compel state governments, especially if the order to shut down places of worship was done lawfully.

State and local politicians have similarly expressed resistance to this order.

Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo said she will not alter her state’s lockdown protocols to reopen churches. Similarly, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced that her city will be ignoring Trump’s demand.

âBy no means can the president order any locality, any state to do something that he doesn’t have the power to do,â said Lightfoot. âAnd he can’t do that here.â

Public health experts have raised concerns about the risks entailed with reopening religious institutions, especially when there have already been several cases of outbreaks spreading from church congregations. A small outbreak of COVID-19 broke out in rural Arkansas which spread from a pastor and his wife to around three dozen of their parishioners. At least two churches in Texas and Georgia have already shut down after reopening when several of their members tested positive for the coronavirus.

Listen to theÂ Health Ranger ReportÂ with Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, as he talks about how the lockdowns have been weaponized to the detriment of humanity.

CDC issues guidelines for reopening of places of worship

TheÂ Centers for Disease Control and PreventionÂ (CDC) released guidelines Friday afternoon about what communities of faith should follow if they want to maintain good health when they reopen.

Religious institutions should, above all, establish and maintain lines of communication with local and state authorities, provide proper protective equipment for staff and congregants and abide by local, state and federal laws and regulations put in place to protect everyone.

Once churches reopen, the CDC laid out seven key guidelines they need to follow:

Follow social distancing regulationsÂ — Limit the size of gatherings and consider holding services in large or outdoor areas.

— Limit the size of gatherings and consider holding services in large or outdoor areas. Encourage the use of face masksÂ — Both staff and congregants should wear face coverings, especially when social distancing is difficult to follow.

— Both staff and congregants should wear face coverings, especially when social distancing is difficult to follow. Intensify cleaning, disinfection and ventilation effortsÂ — Develop a proper schedule when employees will clean and disinfect all frequently touched surfaces in the building. Increase ventilation in the building and ensure that the church’s current ventilation systems are working properly.

— Develop a proper schedule when employees will clean and disinfect all frequently touched surfaces in the building. Increase ventilation in the building and ensure that the church’s current ventilation systems are working properly. Promote healthy hygiene practicesÂ — Encourage both staff and attendees to practice proper hygiene, such as the washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

— Encourage both staff and attendees to practice proper hygiene, such as the washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Provide childcare services for congregantsÂ — Consider opening proper childcare services, or partnering with nurseries in the area.

— Consider opening proper childcare services, or partnering with nurseries in the area. Minimize the sharing of worship materials and other itemsÂ — Consider temporarily limiting the sharing of materials, such as worship aids, prayer books and other items.

— Consider temporarily limiting the sharing of materials, such as worship aids, prayer books and other items. Train staffÂ — Train both clergy and staff in the above-mentioned guidelines.

The CDC further stated that, during these troubling times, faith leaders should continue providing congregants with spiritual and emotional care and counseling services.

DespiteÂ these guidelines, it remains unclear if Trump can force state and local authorities to reopen houses of worship. The U.S. Constitution reserves considerable powers to states and several courts have already set restrictions on in-person worship services during the pandemic for the promotion of public health.

3,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-23-cuomo-shipped-off-coronavirus-patients-to-ny-nursing-home.html,Natural News,2020-05-23,['Michael Alexander'],"Report: Cuomo shipped off 4,300 coronavirus patients to NY nursing homes",https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2020/05/Coronavirus-Sick-Woman-Hospital-Bed.jpg,"(Natural News) Over 4,300 recovering COVID-19 patients were shipped off to New Yorkâs nursing homes and long-term care facilities as a result of a controversial state directive, according to The Associated Press.

In a count published on its site Friday, the news organization tallied the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from hospitals and transferred to nursing homes under Gov. Andrew Cuomoâs March 25 directive after the New York State Health Department declined to release the figures gleaned from its internal survey, conducted two weeks ago.

The health department is still verifying âincompleteâ data.

According to critics, the directive, which had been intended to help free up hospital beds for the sickest patients as cases surged, instead only helped speed up the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus in the mentioned establishments, in addition to placing an additional burden on already overwhelmed facilities.

âA number of nursing homes have felt constrained by the order and admitted hospital discharged patients without knowing what their COVID status was,â said Chris Laxton, executive director of the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

According to numbers posted by New Yorkâs Department of Health, the state’s nursing home COVID-19 death toll stood well over 5,000 as of this writing, making it a significant chunk of the stateâs total running death toll from the virus.

The directive, which also noted that the stateâs nursing homes and related facilities cannot refuse patients, was reversed on May 10.

Following intense criticism, Cuomo, in his subsequent media briefings, said he was merely following recommendations set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

No matter how much Cuomo spins the said directive however, Stuart Almer, a nursing home operator, said it cannot be denied that the state order still put staff and residents at great risk.

âWe canât draw a straight line from bringing in someone positive to someone catching the disease, but weâre talking about elderly, fragile and vulnerable residents,â Almer stated in an interview with AP. (Related: New York nursing homes now a âslaughterhouseâ for elderly coronavirus patients.)

According to Almer, his staff at Gurwin Jewish, a 460-bed nursing home on Long Island, had to scramble in order to accommodate what he called a âfloodâ of 58 recovering COVID-19 patients from local hospitals.

Almer stressed that while they did what they could to ensure the safety of their residents, such as by erecting more walls and by implementing other safety measures, residents at Gurwin nonetheless started falling sick, 47 of which died of confirmed or suspected COVID-19.

The families of those who died are furious.

“It was the single dumbest decision anyone could make if they wanted to kill people,” Daniel Arbeeny told the AP in an interview.

According to Arbeeny, his 88-year-old father succumbed to the virus after being pulled out of a Brooklyn nursing home that saw more than 50 deaths.

“This isn’t rocket science. We knew the most vulnerable were in nursing homes and rehab centers,” Arbeeny said, citing studies that pointed to the elderly and immunocompromised as being the most likely to succumb to the virus.

Former New York lieutenant governor and Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths founder Betsy McCaughey did not mince words when speaking about the current situation in the stateâs nursing homes.

âTheyâre death pits,â McCaughey told The New York Times.

âThese nursing homes are already overwhelmed. Theyâre crowded and theyâre understaffed. One COVID-positive patient in a nursing home produces carnage,â she added.

As of press time, the state of New York has recorded a running total of 358,000 infections and 23,195 deaths from the coronavirus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

The Jeff Bezos-owned, left-wing rag recently published an article in its “technology” section explaining that fake news employees of the paper are basically being paid to scour the web in search of Plandemic so they can report it to the hosting website and try to have it removed.

One perhaps unexpected place that the Post has had no trouble getting Plandemic removed from is Google Drive, a cloud-based file-sharing service that many Facebook users and YouTubers have been linking to whenever public copies of the film get censored or removed by Big Tech platforms.

Even though Google Drive accounts are supposed to be private, much like your personal hard drive, the Post has reportedly been successful in convincing Google to invade users’ files and remove Plandemic whenever they find a copy.

To those who know the Constitution, this is an obvious violation of free speech and personal privacy. But to the Post, it is a necessary response to the “weaponization” of Google Drive’s services for the purpose of “amplify[ing] dangerous content.”

Because Plandemic offers a different take on the pandemic that does not fully align with the official narrative, the Post and its Big Tech partners do not believe that you should be allowed to view it.

Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, discusses how even Brighteon is now being censored by Facebook, probably because it hosts the Plandemic film without question or restriction:

The Post is now actively policing channels, pages that try to share the Plandemic film

One would think that, logically speaking, there is nothing to fear from allowing Plandemic to circulate far and wide if the content it contains is “false” and “dangerous” as the Post claims. It will eventually debunk itself, right?

Since the fix is on to force it down the memory hole, however, we can only conclude that there must be something to Plandemic that those fomenting the sham crusade against it do not want the public to learn.

Facebook and YouTube both announced back in early May that Plandemic had to go from their platforms because it makes “medically unsubstantiated” claims about the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

Among other things, the film questions the alleged importance of lockdowns. It also features the astute Dr. Judy Mikovitz who wrote a powerful book entitled,Â Plague of Corruption: Restoring Faith in the Promise of Science that questions vaccine safety and effectiveness, a big no-no.

What many social media users are having to do in order to still draw attention to Plandemic online is manually edit out Dr. Mikovitz’s interviews, for instance, or remove the “most problematic claims,” to quote the Post. In other words, only censored versions of the Plandemic trailer are being allowed to circulate.

Elon Musk of Tesla conducted his own witch hunt back in March against the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which is similarly being targeted by Big Tech. Musk tweeted a link to a Google Drive document citing a study about the alleged efficacy of the drug, and since that time Google has removed and blocked that document.

When asked if Google actively scans the files that users store in Google Drive, Google spokeswoman Alex Krasov refused to say, adding that her company “doesn’t go into details” about how its anti-misinformation policies are enforced.

Sadly, he’s surrounded by evil and corruption in Washington D.C., and he’s made some mistakes, especially in picking the wrong people who turned out to be traitors (Jeff Sessions, anyone?). But from what I’ve learned, Trump is still fighting for humanity, and he hasn’t gone over to the dark side as many of us had feared.

In summary, although my fears were grounded in honestly observed actions involving Trump, his “vaccine czar” and Dr. Fauci’s influence at the White House, I have now learned from reliable sources that Trump is fully aware of the risks of vaccines, the dangers of the Big Pharma drug cartels and the need to respect health freedom across America.

At the same time, Trump has taken other actions that are courageous and compelling:

I can confidently tell you today that my fears were unfounded. President Trump has not given in to Big Pharma and the vaccine industry, and he actually pushed Fauci onto the stage in order to attract intense public scrutiny that has now exposed the Fauci fraud for what it really is.

( Natural News ) Today we bring you an important update and correction. I had previously voiced concerns about Trump promoting Big Pharma and the coronavirus, fearing that the White House had been taken over by the “death science” con man Dr. Fauci and other Big Pharma operatives.

7,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-22-mutated-virus-coronavirus-outbreak-in-northeast-china.html,Natural News,2020-05-22,['Michael Alexander'],Experts: “Mutated” virus involved in new coronavirus outbreak in northeast China,https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2020/05/Coronavirus-China-Border-Fence-Prison-Lockdown.jpg,"(Natural News) A new cluster of COVID-19 cases has emerged in the northeastern provinces of Chinaâs Rust Belt region, with doctors noting that the virus involved in the new cases is behaving differently compared to the one first encountered in Wuhan late last year.

According to Qiu Haibo, an expert in critical care medicine who is part of the National Health Commission expert group, the virus found in patients in the provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang was unique, in that its incubation period was longer compared to that of the patients in Wuhan.

In addition, Qiu noted that while Wuhanâs patients suffered severe lung, myocardial, renal and intestinal damage, the cases in Chinaâs Rust Belt mainly showed lung damage, with very slight damage to the heart, kidney or intestines.

The Rust Belt cases too, were largely asymptomatic, in the sense that they did not manifest any elevations in their temperature and only exhibited minor symptoms such as sore throats and fatigue.

âThis causes a problem, as they donât have any symptoms. So when they gather with their families they donât care about this issue and we see family cluster infections,â Qiu told state broadcaster CCTV, Tuesday.

Qiu, in his interview, said the strain of the virus found in the Rust Belt clusters was probably imported from abroad, which could explain the differences between the Wuhan and Jilin cases.

According to authorities, the first case of infection was reported early this month in Jilin Province, which borders Russia and North Korea. This infection then spread to the cities of Jilin, Shulan and Shengyang.

State media Xinhua, meanwhile, reported that the province logged a total of 135 confirmed locally transmitted cases, of which 108 had been discharged.Â Twenty-fiveÂ individuals, as per local media, are still hospitalized.Â (Related: New coronavirus strain may be emerging and causing survivors to get REINFECTED.)

As a response to the new cases, Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for strengthened measures to contain the infection, including the halting of public transport services, the sealing off of residential compounds in some of the cities in the region, and the creation of an emergency response team.

Five hundredÂ medical professionals have also been tapped to help address the outbreak, as confirmed by Liu Qizhi, director of the Jilin municipal health authority.

Experts confirm: Coronavirus may be mutating

Perhaps due to intensified worry and speculation over a second wave of potentially fatal coronavirus infections, public speculation on coronavirus mutations have since flooded the internet.

Experts, however, say this fascination with viral mutations may be a case of much ado about nothing.

As with all known viruses, it is normal for the coronavirus to change and mutate, according to Nels Elde, an associate professor of human genetics at the University of Utah.

âViruses mutate. Thatâs one of the things that makes them such a successful entity,â Elde said in an interview with ABC News, noting that because viruses are constantly copying themselves, it is inevitable for some of its copies to manifest random mistakes or mutations.

âThe word âmutationâ to people means something bad because itâs got that connotation to it,â Vincent Racaniello, a professor of microbiology at Columbia University Medical Center, noted.

According to Racaniello, âmutationâ in the context of viruses simply means a change in their genome sequence.

âIt doesnât mean that itâs necessarily bad for you at all,â Racaniello said.

Keiji Fukuda, director and clinical professor at the University of Hong Kongâs School of Public Health, had the same sentiment, noting in an interview with BloombergÂ that while some changes in the genetic structure can, in theory, lead to changes in the virusâs structure or its behavior, many mutations lead to no actual and discernible changes at all.

Lucy Van Dorp, a research associate with the University College Londonâs Genetics Institute, meanwhile, noted in an interview with Al Jazeera that while 198 mutations of the virus have been found so far, the vast majority of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome are likely to be neutral or without impact.

As of press time, the coronavirus has infected 5,127,125 and killed 333,398Â according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

8,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-22-sweden-coronavirus-death-rate-overtakes-uk-italy.html,Natural News,2020-05-22,['Michael Alexander'],"Sweden’s coronavirus death rate overtakes UK, Italy",https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2020/05/Dying-Hospital-Ill-Terminally-Aged-Bed-Care.jpg,"(Natural News) Denmark, Finland and Norway are still eyeing the possibility of maintaining travel restrictions on Sweden in light of the exponential climb in the latter countryâs coronavirus death toll.

Sweden, unlike its Nordic neighbors — and the rest of the world, for that matter — has largely taken a softer and non-draconian approach to fighting the ongoing pandemic, opting instead to leave schools, shops and restaurants open to the general public. Social distancing and good hygiene, meanwhile, two factors needed to successfully mitigate the continued spread of the virus, are encouraged but not enforced.

This relatively lax approach on the pandemic has since led to a sudden uptick in the countryâs number of cases, with Sweden now the leading country in terms of COVID-19 mortality rate per capita.

According to a tracker developed by the Financial Times, Sweden logged 6.4 deaths per million people two months after its death rate first climbed above 0.1 deaths per million. This rate is much higher when compared to the UKâs 6.2 deaths per million at the same stage, as well as Italy and Spain, which logged rates of 5.5 and 4, respectively.

Anders Tegnell, Swedenâs state epidemiologist, previously said that the countryâs no-lockdown approach hinged on allowing their people to keep âa reasonably normal life.â (Related:Â Anti-lockdown Sweden is no success story as study shows large surge in deaths.)

However, despite the relative support coming from the Swedish population regarding the lax implementations, some have been more critical.

âWe have one of the highest death rates in the world, which is sad,” Stefan Hansson, an expert in international health, said, adding that around two-thirds of COVID-19 deaths in Sweden could have been avoided had the government enforced a more stringent lockdown policy.

As of press time, Sweden has logged a total 3,831 deaths from COVID-19.

According to Maria Ohisalo, Finlandâs interior minister, Swedenâs high death toll and infection rate are the factors that are keeping its fellow Nordic countries — Denmark, Finland Iceland and Norway — from easing their travel restrictions and forming a âtravel bubble,â in reference to a joint agreement between Baltic states Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, that has allowed free movement between their countries.

âNorway, Denmark and Iceland have managed to stabilise their situation, but in Sweden the situation is more alarming,â Ohisalo said.

Swedenâs nursing care homes — a coronavirus feeding ground?

With the increased scrutiny in light of the countryâs near-meteoric increase in coronavirus-related deaths, Swedenâs nursing care homes and long-term care facilities have been thrust into the spotlight, after critics argued that the countryâs elderly are now bearing the brunt of the Swedish authoritiesâ laissez-faire approach to the pandemic.

The FolkhÃ¤lsomyndighetenÂ or the Swedish Public Health Agency has since confirmed this, noting in a statement to the BBC that 48.9 percent of the countryâs coronavirus deaths were nursing care home residents.

“We did not manage to protect the most vulnerable people, the most elderly, despite our best intentions,” Swedish Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven said.

According to critics, the large number of deaths among the elderly can be traced to lack of protective clothingÂ at the nursing homes and care facilities, as well as the flouting of self-quarantine rules among nursing home personnel.

“We are sacrificing old people and people with diseases,” said Olle Kampe, a professor and senior consultant in endocrinology at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.

Healthcare workers and professionals have aired criticism as well, noting that regional healthcare authorities have enacted protocols that discourage care home workers from sending residents into hospitals, as well as prevent care home and nursing staff from administering oxygen to patients without a doctor’s approval — even as part of their palliative or end-of-life services.

“There are a lot of different aspects to our approach. Protecting the elderly in the elderly homes was just one of them. That approach did not work very well,” Tegnell said, adding that the health authorities are now trying to improve their approach by collaborating with the people running the nursing homes.

As of this writing, 5,194,000 have been infected with the Wuhan coronavirus globally, while 334,622 have been confirmed dead.

9,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-22-washington-state-loses-millions-to-nigerian-unemployment-fraud.html,Natural News,2020-05-22,['Franz Walker'],Washington state loses hundreds of millions to Nigerian unemployment claims fraud,https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2020/05/Hacker-Scam-Hack-Phishing-Internet-Web-Stolen.jpg,"(Natural News) Officials in the state of Washington have acknowledged the loss of âhundreds of millions of dollarsâ to an international scheme that hammered the state’s unemployment insurance system. The attack, which is thought to have originated in Nigeria, could mean even longer delays for thousands of unemployed workers still waiting for legitimate benefits.

The staggering losses were disclosed by Washington state Employment Security Department (ESD) Commissioner Suzi LeVine during a news conference Thursday afternoon. LeVine declined to specify exactly how much money was stolen during the scam. She conceded, however, that the amount was âorders of magnitude above the $1.6 million that the ESD reported as having lost to fraud in April.

Fraud comes and unemployment claims went down in other states

According to LeVine, state and law enforcement officials were working to recover as much of the money as possible, though she declined to mention how much had been recovered so far. She also said that the ESD had taken âa number of stepsâ to prevent further fraudulent claims from being filed or paid, but did not specify the steps, to avoid tipping off criminals.

âWe do have definitive proof that the countermeasures we have put in place are working,â LeVine said. âWe have successfully prevented hundreds of millions of additional dollars from going out to these criminals and prevented thousands of fraudulent claims from being filed.â

LeVine’s disclosure, which came after state officials initially refused to discuss the scale of the fraud, helped explain the unusual surge in new unemployment claims filed in Washington state last week. For the week ending May 16, the ESD received 138,733 initial unemployment insurance claims, representing a 26.8 percent increase over the previous week and one of the biggest weekly surges since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. (Related:Â Coronavirus pushesÂ unemploymentÂ to highest levels since the Great Depression.)

The surge in claims came as the number of initial claims for unemployment insurance nationwide fell 9.2 percent, to 2.4 million, according to data released earlier in the day by theÂ Department of Labor.

Thanks to the sudden increase in claims, Washington became the state with the highest percentage of its civilian labor force filing unemployment claims — at 30.8 percent according to an analysis by nonpartisan Washington, D.C., think tank the Tax Foundation. The next highest state, Nevada, reported claims from 24.5 percent of its workforce.

The disclosures also raised new questions about what, if anything, the ESD could have done to detect and protect its system from the attack.

Last week, theÂ United States Secret Service had already issued an alert warning that Washington was the primary target of a âwell-organized Nigerian fraud ring exploiting the COVID-19 crisis to commit large-scale fraud against state unemployment insurance programs.â The alert also noted that there was evidence of attacks on other states such as Florida, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island and Wyoming, warning of âpotential losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars.â

Nigerian fraud ring implicated

Among theÂ criminal groups involved in the attack is a Nigerian organization known as Scattered Canary, based on a report released this week by California-based cybersecurity firm Agari, who has been tracking the organization’s activities for some time now. According to the report, the group has been running various scams for over a decade now, working to steal Social Security payments, disaster relief funds and student aid, among others.

The Nigerian group likely used personal information about Washingtonians taken from previous consumer-data breaches to file bogus claims in the state’s unemployment system. These were then paid out alongside hundreds of thousands of legitimate ones.

âThese crime rings are indiscriminate and very quick to jump on an opportunity,â said Armen Najarian, chief identity officer for Agari, in an interview.

ESD officials have claimed that the group targetted Washington because it was one of the first states to begin paying out new benefits available under the $2.2 trillion federal stimulus bill.Â While this legislation boosted benefits available under existing state unemployment insurance systems, it also gave state officials less time to verify new claims for those benefits.

According to ESD officials, the elimination of the so-called âwaiting weekâ between the time a claim is filed and the time the benefit is paid meant that the agency wasn’t always able to get proper verification from employers about a claim before payment was made.

In addition, since federal benefits were technically availableÂ beginning in March, weeks before the state was able to upgrade its system to be able to pay them, many claimants had retroactive claims waiting to be paid in the ESD’s system.

At the federal level, the attack is being investigated by the inspector generals of theÂ Social Security Administration and theÂ Department of Labor; theÂ United States Secret Service; and theÂ Federal Bureau of Investigation, under the coordination of the office of U.S. Attorney Brian T. Moran inÂ Seattle.

On Thursday, Moran said that federal officials worked with a âdiligent financial institutionâ toÂ stopÂ â$120 million from being distributed to criminals,â and were âassisting in recovering millions of additional dollars, with assistance from scores of other banks and credit unions.â

FromÂ vinegar to radiation, professionals have toutedÂ a host of products and practices alleged to be effective against COVID-19.

With each passing week, there seems to be a new and improved instant âfixâ to the disease. That said, most of theseÂ fixes are proven to be ineffective and based on no scientific evidence whatsoever.

How to prepare for COVID-19

With the pandemic still ongoing, COVID-19 remains an active area of research. Scientists are moving at a snail’s pace when it comes to understanding the new coronavirus, but it cannot be helped.

What can be helped, though, is our bodies. As with most infections and diseases, a person is more susceptible to pathogens if he or she isn’t fit to begin with. While it’s true that the virus can still latch onto the healthiest individuals, watching out for certain biomarkers of poor health can afford us time to turn things around before it’s too late.

With that, here are some helpful tips toÂ follow in preparation for COVID-19:

Watch out for signs of diabetes

According to recent reports from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions like diabetes and heart disease are more vulnerable to severe complications linked to COVID-19.

One reason for this is that infections tend to be harder to cure in general for people with diabetes due to fluctuations in blood glucose levels and the presence of diabetes complications. People with chronic diseases like diabetes also tend to be immunocompromised, thus making them more susceptible to COVID-19.

If you haven’t been diagnosed with prediabetes or diabetes, some signs to watch out for include increased thirst, frequent urination, sudden weight loss, blurred vision, slow-healing wounds, tender gums and frequent infections.

Avoid foods that raise cholesterol and blood pressure

Heart health depends on two major factors: cholesterol and blood pressure. Excess cholesterol can lead to clogged arteries, increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke and heart failure. High blood pressure, on the other hand, often leads to arterial stiffness, another major factor for heart disease.

Like diabetes, heart disease makes a person more susceptible to severe complications related to COVID-19. People with heart disease tend to be weaker in general due to poor blood circulation. To support heart health, avoid the following foods:Â pastries, processed meat, red meat and canned foods.

Quit smoking

The Wuhan coronavirus targets the lungs, so quitting or refraining from smoking should be a no-brainer. A recent review published inÂ Tobacco Induced DiseasesÂ established that smoking is associated with theÂ negative progression and adverse outcomesÂ of COVID-19.

In particular, smoking can exacerbate complications linked to pneumonia and the flu, two infectious diseases with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19. These complications include wheezing, shortness of breath, chronic coughs, chest pain and fever.

Exercise often

There is no conclusive evidence that being fit reduces the risk of contracting COVID-19, but recent studies show that exercise helps strengthen the immune system.

Exercise, in particular, can help flush out bacteria and other pathogens from the lungs, thus reducing the risk of catching a cold, flu and other similar infections.

Exercise also stimulates antibodies and white blood cells to work harder, resulting in the better detection of harmful pathogens. The rise in temperature after a period of exercise can also inhibit bacterial growth in the lungs.

In addition, exercise helps reduce cholesterol and regulate blood pressure.

Lose weight

Overweight individuals are at an increased risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. As discussed earlier, conditions like these can compromise an individual’s immune functions and make them more susceptible to COVID-19.

As such, it’s important to follow a balanced diet. Diabetic or obese individuals can take it a step further and follow a plant-based diet.Â This diet can include animal products, but a large chunk of it should be comprised of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, fish and olive oil.

Coupling a balanced diet with regular exercise can also help burn excess weight and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.

Maintaining a healthy body and a strong immune system greatly reduces your risk of catching COVID-19.Â (Related: Strengthen the immune system with these 12 superfoods.)

11,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-21-coronavirus-vaccines-will-contain-aborted-human-babies.html,Natural News,2020-05-21,['Ethan Huff'],CONFIRMED: Coronavirus vaccines will contain aborted human babies,https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2020/05/Coronavirus-Covid-19-Vaccine-Syringe-Lab.jpg,"(Natural News) Pro-lifers everywhere had better think long and hard about what they plan to do in the event that state or local governments try to mandate vaccination for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) once a jab is commercially released because chances are those syringes will contain the remnants of aborted babies.

Even though President Trump has said that Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines will not be mandated at the federal level, there is still the possibility that some states may try to force them locally, which will put not just those opposed to vaccination in a tough position but also those who recognize the sanctity of unborn human life.

After it was announced recently that Canada’s largest federal research and development organization has teamed up with a Chinese vaccine company to test a new trial coronavirus vaccine in Canada, Dr. Alan Moy, M.D., founder and scientific director of the John Paul II Medical Research Institute and CEO of Cellular Engineering Technologies decided to do some digging, upon which he discovered that the test vaccine in question is made from aborted fetal cell lines.

CanSino Biologics Inc., also known as CanSinoBIO, is the name of the Chinese firm that partnered up with Canada’s National Research Council (NRC) to conduct trials on Ad5-nCoV, as it is being called, which Dr. Moy found contains a cell line known as HEK293 that was derived from unborn children that were murdered while still inside their mothers’ wombs.

“Since it’s using an adenovirus replication-defective vector, it is using HEK293,” Dr. Moy told LifeSiteNews. “HEK293 is an aborted fetal cell line.”

What’s worse, Ad5-nCoV probably won’t even work

Besides its unethical origins, the Ad5-nCoV more than likely will not even work as promised, Dr. Moy warns. As it turns out, there is a high incidence of immunity against Ad5, so most of the people who are injected with it will confer no protection whatsoever against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

“I don’t envy Canadians,” Dr. Moy is further quoted as saying. “Your government and PM (prime minister) have mandated draconian policies that are anti-life … Not a good vaccine solution if pro-life or pro-choice.”

What is further confounding is the fact that Canada would even agree to contract with a vaccine company based out of China, which is where this whole crisis originated. Ad5-nCoV was reportedly also co-developed by the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology which, like all other Chinese institutions, is governed and controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

This vaccine is said to be the first “phase 2” coronavirus vaccine, meaning it has been approved to be “safely” used in human test subjects. And the Canadian government could not be more excited about the prospect of injecting as many Canadians as possible with it to “cure” them of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

“NRC is proud of our ongoing partnership with CanSino Biologics,” stated NRC President Iain Stewart in a recent press release.

Dr. Xuefeng Yu, chairman and CEO of CanSinoBIO, also stated in the same press release that his company has “strong connections to Canada” and is “proud to be building on past successes and continuing our ongoing partnership with the NRC to address health needs on a global scale.”

Amazingly, both the NRC and CanSinoBIO are proud of their proprietary HEK293 aborted baby cell line, which they say will help “to advance a scale-up production process for the vaccine candidate.” In other words, thanks to these aborted babies, Canada and China will be able to produce Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines for mass distribution much faster than normal, paving the way for a global vaccination campaign unlike anything the world has ever seen.

Dr. Judy Mikovits, Andreas Kalcker and myself, Mike Adams, offered a comprehensive list that could radically improved humanity’s survival, health and prosperity. Here’s a partial transcript from the video:

Judy Mikovits: The first thing to do is to end the 1986 Vaccine Injury Compensation act, which removes all liability. The second thing is a five-year moratorium on all vaccines until theyâre tested safe and thatâll take a lot longer than five years. In those five years,everyoneâs going to realize they have natural immunity and youâre going to see these diseases go away. Close the FDA. Close the CDC. Close the EPA. All of these corrupt organizations, reorganize them. Open them to give back the taxpayers their money to be able to use the medicines naturally.Weâll put Dr. David Lewis in charge of the EPA. He wrote the book Science for Sale uncovering the corruption in that industry. We can have Dr. Stephanie sent up there over the FDA. No more GMO, no more Roundup so he can do all these things and reject and end the BayhâDole Act… which government employees who are paid with taxpayer money for Health and Human Services to patent their work. No more patents. All the drugs belong to the people. All our brains belong to the people because you paid for our education, everything. That will turn around all of medicine to give it back all doctors equal. No more health insurance. $5000 tax-free account you can spend on anything you want. Your supplement, your cannabis, your chlorine dioxide. You can take care of your health just the way we used to when I was a little kid.

Mike Adams: In addition to that outstanding list, I would ask President Trump issue an Executive order expanding the First Amendment to cover truthful speech about nutritional supplements and natural interventions, alternative medicine, healing remedies. If itâs truthful, then it should not be criminal, obviously. If we just shut down the FDA and the FTC and the CDC that would solve the problem as well. Secondly, and this is something President Trump can issue right now, he can issue an Executive Order ordering the FDA to ban direct-to-consumer drug advertisements. They are illegal in almost every country in the world. If he were to do that, he would immediately halt the disease-mongering and the profiteering of the drug companies. He would cut off about 70 percent of the revenues to the fake news industries such as CNN that depends on pharma profits, which is why they are puppets of Big Pharma. He could do that with an Executive Order. Finally, I agree with Dr. Mikovits that patents, there should never be intellectual property claims over drugs. Drugs can be developed by universities. Most of the drug development that happens in the United States is actually funded by the NIH anyway, and drug companies simply exploit that free money so they can make billions off of patented drugs, which are really FDA-enforced drug monopolies. That needs to end.

Andreas Kalcker: I would put to that that when you have the patents, you cannot patent any living entity at all. Life is life and this is not patentable, and this is one of the things that has been put in the last time that has to be out of that. Because if you cannot patent a virus, thereâs no business anymore. The next thing is that you can make the pharmaceutical compound. We donât need the FDA-approved thing if chlorine dioxide is just approved as a pharmaceutical compound. Itâs a very simple substance that can be used and prescribed by every doctor and be made in any simple pharmacy. That would be my dream and the dream of the world. We could end [the pandemic] in a very few months before even the elections. We could end all these drama of coronavirus.

Judy Mikovits: And restore our economy. These gross natural products. This HHS. This whole corrupt monster. Just knock it down. And give us back our freedom.

In the IAMTV video below, you can hear the suggestions for President Trump beginning at around 28:20.",12.5,Very low,,USA,0

This is exactly what President Donald Trump, the FDA, and the federal coronavirus task force seem to be doing. They are fast-tracking experimental injections through clinical trials so they can be distributed en masse with the assistance of the U.S. military.

The federal government is hastening the scientific process and therefore polluting and corrupting it. The President’s âwarp speedâ demands for mass-produced biologics will inevitably cause unintended consequences, as biologics are unavoidably unsafe. (1 Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC)

These inevitable vaccine injuries will no doubt be swept under the rug and be handled by the Department of Health and Human Services and the special master of the Vaccine Court. This system was set up in 1988 to pay off select families of vaccine-injured children while granting vaccine makers legal immunity, preserving faulty vaccine supply. To make matters worse, the HHS has recently admitted in court that the lawfully required safety studies have not been conducted to improve vaccine safety over the past thirty-two years.

To heighten the coercion, several governors have announced extended state-wide lockdowns and restrictions, claiming that there will be no going back to normal until a vaccine or pharmaceutical is widely available. This is medical coercion empowered by the force of government â the likes of which the world has not witnessed since the rise of the Nazis. Not only is the scientific process being bastardized, but state governments are being used to punish certain businesses and suppress the people, to coerce the population to comply with upcoming, fast-tracked biologics and gene therapy injections.

The vaccine that the world is being held hostage for is coming along great â WAIT A MINUTE!

On January 11, Chinese authorities shared a genetic sequence of novel coronavirus with US vaccine company, Moderna. Just two days later, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NSAID) finalized the sequence for mRNA-1273, allowing Moderna to manufacture the sequence for clinical trials. The NSAID is governed by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the lead spokesman for the federal coronavirus task force, and the same man who helped fund the Wuhan Institute of Virology where China conducted controversial research on bats and coronavirus gain-of-function.

This sequence is not the only coronavirus mutation identified by scientists. This year, there have been over thirty coronavirus mutations identified, each circulating in different hemispheres and regions, eliciting various viral loads and gain-of-function properties, causing various symptoms, ranging from a mild cold to symptoms much more severe.

On March 23, it was declared that the vaccine wouldnât be commercially available for 12 to 18 months; however, Moderna announced that it could be available for âemergency useâ before the end of the year. Moderna was then awarded hundreds of millions of dollars to enable large scale production of mRNA-1273. The company announced a worldwide collaboration with a biotechnology company named Lonza, to manufacture up to 1 billion doses of mRNA-1273 per year.

Now, this is a new kind of vaccine that inserts lab-grown genetic RNA material into your body, forcing an invasion into your cells. After the RNA material invades your cells and hijacks your cell’s ribosomes, it forces the cells to produce viral components such as the iconic spike protein. This vaccine-augmented, self-replicating spike protein, produced within the cells, is intended to train the immune system to fight. This manipulation of cellular protein encoding will never be adequately studied for safety in clinical trials, for it’s real effects can only be observed in the population over time.

The government and the vaccine makers have already prepared this biological preparation for mass distribution long before it had ever been researched through any credible scientific process, long before it had ever passed any serology efficacy test, or passed any animal safety tests, including primate and ferret studies. In tests on guinea pigs, 20 percent suffered serious reactions within 43 days, mirroring similar results that were obtained on the infamous SARS vaccine trials that caused pulmonary immunopathology in animals upon subsequent infection.

This new RNA sequence is currently being tested on people and rushed through human clinical trials so it can be released onto populations that are currently being coerced to accept a ânew normalâ until this cell-hijacking, gene-altering Holy Grail vaccine is available.

According to the pharmaceutical-funded media, this Holy Grail has passed through Phase 1 with flying colors. The RNA viral sequence and its accompanying formulation (undisclosed) has elicited an immune response in a small group of human participants between the ages of 18 and 55 years. This vague news has caused the companyâs stock valuation to surge to 29 billion, an astonishing valuation for a company that currently sells zero products.

Moderna is using the pharmaceutical-funded media to their advantage, blitzing the media with corporate success talk but providing little data on real life efficacy and safety. How will this hijacking of cellular protein production and forced augmentation of antibodies hold up over time and how does it affect human DNA?

Scientists at the NSAID, who developed the vaccine prototype, are usually quick to advertise their successes. They have made no comment on the phase 1 trial and are currently quiet on the matter. Moderna, on the other hand, trumpeted their phase 1 results, watching their stock market valuation soar. Their press release praised the development of âbinding antibodiesâ and omitted the fact that only eight out of forty-five vaccine recipients have so far developed neutralizing antibodies â the kind that are needed. The antibody assessment comes after participants received two doses of the vaccines and had their blood tested two weeks later. The researchers will never know if these antibodies are durable, whether they will convey any form of short or long-standing immunity. Moreover, this new RNA encoding and its artificial augmentation of an immune response could have repercussions as the immune system could attack the body’s own cells. Could these RNA messenger immune augmentations ultimately generate strong type I interferon responses, leading to chronic inflammation and inflammatory conditions?

âI would like to see the data to make my own interpretation of the data,â said Anna Durbin, a vaccine researcher at Johns Hopkins University. âBut I think it is at least encouraging that weâve seen immune responses with this RNA vaccine that we havenât seen with previous RNA vaccines for other pathogens. Whether itâs going to be enough, we donât know.â Two weeks is very early, she said. âWe donât know if those antibodies are durable.â

Upon further investigation, the vaccine appears to trigger the production of âbinding antibodiesâ that foreshadow the âpathogenic primingâ that caused deaths in early SARS coronavirus vaccine experiments that failed to come to market during the 2002-2003 outbreak. Moreover, there is a 20% percent âseriousâ injury rate among the extremely healthy volunteers in the high dose group, which elicited medical intervention or hospitalization. Moderna has not disclosed whether the immune response they measured was more prevalent in the young or the old. Lastly, Moderna has not disclosed whether the immune response they measured is harmful upon subsequent infection, is capable of causing autoimmune issues, or causes damage to cellular processes that cannot be undone.

14,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-21-china-finally-admits-it-destroyed-coronavirus-samples.html,Natural News,2020-05-21,['Isabelle Z.'],China finally admits it destroyed coronavirus samples but claims it was done for “safety”,https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2020/05/Scientist-Lab-Samples-Coronavirus.jpg,"(Natural News) China has finally admitted to destroying samples of coronavirus early in the outbreak, but theyâre insisting they did it out of safety concerns rather than as part of any sort of coverup. Given their track record, however, doubts remain about the true motivation behind the move.

A supervisor for Chinaâs National Health Commission, Liu Dengfeng, finally admitted in a news conference that the government there issued an order on January 3 directing some facilities to dispose of coronavirus samples. Liu said the order was a measure that aimed to âprevent the risk to laboratory biological safety and prevent secondary disasters caused by unidentified pathogens.”

Liu added that the labs had been âunauthorizedâ to handle the samples and therefore had to destroy them to comply with public health laws in the country. He stopped short of specifying how the samples were destroyed or why those labs had them in the first place.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been accusing China for months of destroying the samples to cover up the extent of the countryâs outbreak. Last month, he expressed frustration with the Chinese government for not sharing virus samples from within the country with the rest of the world â something that makes it impossible to assess the evolution of the disease.

He has also accused the country of censoring coronavirus research and trying to influence international efforts to fight the disease. He criticized the country for taking too long to report the outbreak to the World Health Organization and said that even when they did notify them, they failed to share all of the information at their disposal.

Last week, he said: “The Chinese Communist Party tried to suppress information about this virus, about where it began, about how it started, about how it was being transmitted from human to human, indeed employed the World Health Organization to further that storyline.”

The U.S. has been impacted disproportionately by the disease, with almost one quarter of the worldâs infections and deaths being seen in America. So far, more than 4.59 million people have tested positive for the disease globally and at least 309,000 have died according to official numbers â although the real death toll is widely believed to be far higher.

President Trump has said heâs âvery disappointed in Chinaâ and that he has no desire to talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Intelligence reports show China acted irresponsibly

A report from the department of Homeland Security shows that American officials believe that China intentionally covered up how severe the pandemic was in early January while hoarding medical supplies. Meanwhile, a leaked dossier by the Five Eyes intelligence alliance outlines how Beijing has caused some whistleblowers to mysteriously âdisappearâ and scrubbed mentions of the disease in its early stages from the internet while destroying virus samples. They called their actions an âassault on international transparency.â

Other intelligence agencies have reached similar findings. For example, Der Spiegel reported on a German intelligence document that suggests the Chinese president personally pressured the Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, into holding back info about human-to-human transmission and delaying a pandemic warning.

In fact, Germanyâs Federal Intelligence Service estimated that Chinaâs actions âlost four to six weeks to fight the virus worldwide.â

Is it any surprise that the majority of Americans view China negatively and have no confidence in President Xi?

We already knew that China destroyed those samples, so admitting to doing so and making up an excuse for it isnât going to do much to make them look any better. In fact, it will only add fuel to the rumors of coverups that are going on in the country, including those surrounding how this disease came into existence in the first place. If they were really so worried about âsafety,â they would have acted far differently from theÂ start of this pandemic, and thousands of people around the world who have died in the last few months might still be alive and with their loved ones today.

Sara Cunial, who previously sounded the alarm about how Gates has been pushing his vaccine agenda in Africa and India for years, says that this “vaccine criminal” needs to be taken off the streets and dealt with for the protection of humanity. In essence, she declared that he is a threat to human civilization and the safety of children.

Leave it to Italy to be the nation that calls a spade a spade when it comes to the nefarious activities of Bill Gates, who our own media and politicians routinely praise for his alleged “contributions” to “humanitarian” efforts. Not only is Gates a fraud, but he is a proven genocidal maniac who is actively trying to “thin the herd” through mass vaccination.

Gates hates freedom, and even more than that he hates innocent humanity, and particularly precious children whom he sees as nothing more than human guinea pigs to be exploited for financial and political gain. Gates is a dangerous criminal, in other words, and Cunial is right: He needs to go.

Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, discusses how mandatory vaccination is a form of medical rape, and those who engage in forcing vaccines on people are guilty of committing felony assault:

Just say NO to Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines

Keep in mind that as far back as 2015, Italian leaders were actively warning the world that communist China was conducing biological experiments with coronaviruses. A November 2015 broadcast, in fact, showed Chinese scientists meddling with SARS (severe acute respiratory system), a cousin of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

It was asked at that time whether such experiments were even necessary, let alone safe. If there was even a small possibility that such viruses might escape into the general public, then such experiments needed to end, was the message being loudly sent.

As for this latest experiment gone wrong, or so it would seem, Cunial gave a resounding seven-minute speech recently claiming that Italy was subjected to a “holy inquisition of false science.” She added that Italy’s lockdowns were completely unnecessary and were only implemented to advance the globalist agenda, which as we know is being largely spearheaded by Gates and his vaccine agenda.

Cunial continues to urge her fellow political leaders to wake up to what is going on and reject it. She warns that any attempt at compulsory vaccination with a future Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine is a deep state plot to consolidate power and control the masses.

“It is our children who will lose more, who are ‘raped souls,’ with the help of the so-called ‘guarantor of their rights’ and of CISMAI (Italian Coordination of Services against Child Abuse),” Cunial stated as part of her speech, warning about the devastating impacts of all of this on Italy’s, and really the world’s, precious children.

“In this way, the right to school will be granted only with a bracelet to get them used to probation, to get them used to slavery â involuntary treatment and to virtual lager. All this in exchange for a push-scooter and a tablet. All to satisfy the appetites of a financial capitalism whose driving force is the conflict of interest, conflict well represented by the WHO, whose main financier is the well-known ‘philanthropist and savior of the world’ Bill Gates.”

Cunial’s entire speech is available at this link.

But reservations are still down in many areas to such a degree that some restaurant owners are unsure if their businesses will survive.

In Georgia, for instance, which was the first state to end the lockdowns and restart its economy, dine-in business has plummeted to as low as just eight percent of what it was a year prior. And in Texas, which is only allowing restaurants to open at 25 percent capacity, in some cases with airport-style “security” at the door, reservations are consequently down about 83 percent.

The two states receiving the most restaurant business are Alabama and South Carolina, but even these are seeing reservations at barely above 25 percent of normal. This is making it difficult for many restaurants to remain open even if they desperately want to return back to normal.

Because of the way things are opening back up gradually in phases, some experts predict that a shocking one in four restaurants will ultimately go out of business for good. The result will be the further decline of our nation’s economy, which is already on the rocks in many other ways due to the government’s response to the pandemic.

Even in Georgia, strict requirements were put in place to limit the number of customers in restaurants at any given time. Only 10 customers per 500 square feet are permitted, which greatly impedes the ability of restaurants to operate at a feasible capacity to still turn a profit.

Government tyranny is why American restaurants are suffering

Interestingly, polls conducted in states like Alabama and South Carolina show that the vast majority of people are willing to eat out again. The fact that restaurants are continuing to suffer, in other words, has everything to do with government restrictions on how many can eat out at a time.

Data from the National Restaurant Association shows that the restaurant industry as a whole lost an astounding $80 billion in revenue during the months of March and April, mid-March being the time when most states began to shut down in response to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

During the month of April alone, the hospitality industry saw a record five million jobs lost, meaning five million people who could have been serving patrons willing to brave the pandemic are now unemployed indefinitely.

But they were still allowed to serve take-out, right? In many cases yes, assuming this was allowed under state and municipal guidelines. The problem, however, is that to successfully run a kitchen it takes a lot of manpower, not to mention enough supplies to make a variety of meals, which many restaurants simply could not provide with very limited service capacity.

Even with the lockdowns being somewhat lifted in many areas it is still not enough for these businesses to survive, let alone thrive.

“Restaurants are complicated beasts,” says OpenTable CEO Steve Hafner. “You have to order food and supplies. You have to make sure you’ve prepped the kitchen and service areas to be easily disinfected.”

Meanwhile, Anthony Fauci, who heads a government agency promoting new “blockbuster” drugs and vaccines for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), has stated that he believes the country is moving too fast and that everything should continue to remain closed indefinitely.

“I think we’re going in the right direction, but the right direction does not mean we have by any means total control of this outbreak,” he is quoted as saying.

Last we checked, the goal was never to attain “total control” over this outbreak, but rather to “flatten the curve.” Why have the goal posts suddenly shifted?

(Article by Jon Street republished from CampusReform.org)

For years,Â Campus ReformÂ has reported on the number of Confucius Institutes on U.S. college campuses. Funded by the communist regime, these centers are marketed as Chinese language and culture centers. However, U.S. intelligence officials have warned that these centers are little more than “propaganda” arms of the communist country.

The radical left will stop at nothing to intimidate conservative students on college campuses. You can help expose them.Â Find out more Â»

Even the former Chinese propaganda minister, Â Liu Yushan, wrote in a 2010 article for Chinese-state media, âWith regard to key issues that influence our sovereignty and safety, we should actively carry out international propaganda battles against issuers such as Tibet, Xinjiang, Taiwan, human rights and Falun Gong. â¦ We should do well in establishing and operating overseas cultural centers and Confucius Institutes,”Â PoliticoÂ reported in 2018.

While China and the U.S. disagree on most things, this appears to be one area in which officials from both countries share opinions.

FBI Director Christopher Wray said during a 2018 congressional hearing when asked about Confucius Institutes on college campuses, âThe level of naÃ¯vetÃ© on the part of the academic sector about this creates its own issues. Theyâre exploiting the very open research and development environment that we have, which we all revere. But theyâre taking advantage of it.â

CIA reports obtained byÂ The Washington Free BeaconÂ further revealed, “The [Chinese Communist Party] provides âstrings-attached’ funding to academic institutions and think tanks to deter research that casts it in a negative light. It has used this tactic to reward pro-China viewpoints and coerce Western academic publications and conferences to self-censor. The CCP often denies visas to academics who criticize the regime, encouraging many China scholars to preemptively self-censor so they can maintain access to the country on which their research depends.”

While legislation signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2018 resulted in about a dozen U.S. colleges shuttering Confucius Institutes on campus, those closures were largely the result of their loss of funding, rather than concerns for the country’s national security.

And now, nearly two years after that legislation became law, more than 75 Confucius Institutes are still in operation in the U.S., most of them on college campuses. From Maine to Florida to Kansas to California, these centers claim to educate American students about Chinese language and culture, and administrators who run the campuses on which they operate appear to believe the same country that claims to have fewer coronavirus deaths than the U.S, despite its population being more than three times the size of the U.S. population.

Based on data from theÂ National Association of Scholars,Â along with records maintained byÂ Campus Reform, the interactive map below shows the locations where Confucius Institutes still operate. Hover your cursor over each dot to reveal the name of each college or school that currently hosts one of these centers.

As part of its war against courageous women who dare to challenge the status quo, Facebook has now blacklisted all links from Brighteon.com and NaturalNews.com following the user posting of a documentary featuring Dr. Mikovits — “Plandemic” — which questions the standard narrative about the coronavirus vaccine and the W.H.O.

Various language versions of the Plandemic documentary were posted by other users, not by the owners or operators of Brighteon.com or NaturalNews.com. Yet because these videos were earning a large number of shares on Brighteon, as well as editorial coverage on Natural News, Facebook chose to blacklist all links from both platforms, regardless of the content, disallowing anyone from sharing any link from Brighteon or NaturalNews.

This means Facebook has blacklisted hundreds of thousands of videos and articles on gardening, smoothie recipes, nutrition, pet care, diabetes prevention, women’s reproductive health and other topics that offer extraordinary wisdom and aid for humanity. Because Brighteon is a free speech platform, it also hosts videos on more controversial topics, but this is the nature of a free speech platform. Brighteon.com does not endorse the content of every video on its platform.

We believe that Facebook’s efforts to blacklist a competing content platform qualifies as illegal “anti trust” action under U.S. law, and we are asking for your help to demand Facebook remove its blacklisting of competing content platforms. (See action items below.)

Facebook is now dictating what you are allowed to read or even THINK about every subject of controversy

Facebook’s blocking of shared content links goes too far. Even when a user chooses to share a link that she finds valuable, Facebook decides that you can’t share the links you want to share because Facebook disagrees with the content. This fascist “digital book burning” approach allows Facebook to control every conversation, every debate and every “fact” by disallowing all views with which it disagrees.

In fact, by blacklisting entire websites that feature user-generated content such as videos and articles, Facebook is discriminating against all the users on those sites, regardless of the nature of their content (which varies widely).

Currently, Facebook is disallowing all views that contradict the W.H.O., which is obviously run by communist China, an anti-human rights regime with a long, documented history of organ harvesting, political executions and extreme violations of fundamental human rights. This puts Facebook in the position of protecting one of the most heinous anti-human rights political regimes in the history of human civilization. While courageous American scientists and brave Chinese dissenters are silenced, Facebook catapults the propaganda of communist China to the forefront, calling their lies “facts” while everyone who questions the propaganda is silenced.

Why is this tolerated in America? Why is Facebook even allowed to continue to exist when it demonstrates such disdain for the values of free expression that gave rise to America’s greatness?

Not surprisingly, Twitter has also banned our channels in order to prevent us from raising awareness about what appears to be coordinated, illegal censorship among techno-fascist corporations that are obviously protecting communist China and its W.H.O. propaganda institution that repeatedly downplayed the severity of the coronavirus outbreak and pressured the global community to keep air traffic open with China, even as Chinese citizens were spreading the virus around the world.

To defend our right to speak and share honest, humanitarian information that can help save lives and awaken minds, we need your help to voice our protest against Facebook and Twitter using the steps detailed below.

In the mean time, we are encouraging everyone to move over to the new social media network AllSocial.com. Here are the channels we’ve set up there which are just beginning to gain a following. Ditch Facebook and move to AllSocial.com, which promises to respect all points of view and refrain from politically motivated censorship:

AllSocial.com/brighteon

AllSocial.com/naturalnews

AllSocial.com/healthranger

Here’s how you can join our protest against Facebook and Twitter: Follow the steps shown here

If you are a current Facebook user, try to share any link from NaturalNews on Facebook, such as these links:

NaturalNews.com/2020-05-19-trump-coronavirus-vaccine-will-not-be-mandatory.html

Brighteon.com/b616dd2e-de1c-4b1c-a22c-25f1984a58be

When you try to share one of these links, you’ll see this message:

Click on “let us know.” You will see the following form:

A sample message you might consider posting would be along the lines of this:

I am unable to share links from two of my favorite websites, Brighteon.com and NaturalNews.com. It appears that all links from both sites are currently prohibited by Facebook. I find these sites to offer valuable content, and Brighteon is a minority-owned, woman-owned video platform that features documentaries on pioneering women who fight against oppression and fascism. Please restore my ability to share links from these two sites, thank you.

Click “send” to send your message to Facebook.

Action Item #2: Use the Facebook “ask” form

If the process described above didn’t work, you can go directly to a Facebook “ask” form where you can lodge your complaint and request NaturalNews.com and Brighteon.com links be removed from any blacklisting:

Facebook.com/help/contact/571927962827151

At that form, enter a message similar to the example given above:

I am unable to share links from two of my favorite websites, Brighteon.com and NaturalNews.com. It appears that all links from both sites are currently prohibited by Facebook. I find these sites to offer valuable content, and Brighteon is a minority-owned, woman-owned video platform that features documentaries on pioneering women who fight against oppression and fascism. Please restore my ability to share links from these two sites, thank you.

Action Item #3: Tweet Facebook on Twitter and voice your complaint

Facebook can be reached on Twitter at the @Facebook handle. You can tweet Facebook with a short message along the lines of this:

@Facebook Please reinstate my ability to share links from Brighteon.com and NaturalNews.com, as both excellent sites are currently blocked from sharing by Facebook.

While you’re on Twitter, complain to Twitter about banning the /healthranger channel. You can tweet @Twitter or @TwitterComms and demand that @HealthRanger be reinstated to help restore my speech so I can join the public debate about vaccines and the coronavirus, among other topics. Thank you for your support.

Action Item #4: Send an email complaint to Facebook support

Facebook can be emailed at [email protected]

When sending an email to Facebook, be polite and offer your existing account name, then explain why you are calling for NaturalNews.com and Brighteon.com to be reinstated as sharable content sites.

You might use an email subject like, “Please stop blocking sharing of Brighteon.com and NaturalNews.com”

Action Item #5: File a complaint with the FTC

The FTC handles anti-trust matters, and it’s clear that Facebook’s blacklisting of a competing content network hosting third party content is a monopolistic, anti-trust action.

You can file an online complaint with the FTC starting with this link:

FTCcomplaintassistant.gov/GettingStarted?NextQID=192&Url=%23%26panel1-6&SubCategoryID=0#crnt

From there, you answer a series of questions and finalize the complaint.

For this complaint, you did not lose money, but you were deprived of your civil rights to engage in online speech because a social media network (Facebook) engaged in anti-trust, anti-competitive blocking behavior designed to harm a competitor and give Facebook monopoly control over online speech. In addition, there are over 44,000 other users of Brighteon whose civil rights have also been violated by this discriminatory blacklisting of Facebook.

This is the basis for a class-action civil rights complaint against Facebook for its discriminatory policies that act as unfair, monopolistic practices that harm individuals with minority views.

Action Item #6: File a civil rights complaint with the Dept. of Justice

Facebook’s discriminatory blacklisting of an entire platform (Brighteon) that is owned by a minority woman is a civil rights violation that also extends to you when you try to share content from Brighteon.

The US Dept. of Justice investigates civil rights violations that are submitted via this form:

https://civilrights.justice.gov/report/

This form allows you to describe the violation of your civil rights, which includes the right to share First Amendment protected content from hosting platforms, especially when those platforms feature women or oppressed minorities who are engaged in protected speech.

Facebook specifically blacklisted Brighteon after various users uploaded content featuring a female science pioneer named Dr. Judy Mikovits, who formerly conducted research for the National Cancer Institute and who expresses dissenting views on the coronavirus pandemic and its possible resolutions.

No tech platform has the right to violate the civil rights of millions of Americans.

Thank you for your help in protecting these important free speech platforms

Your effort to help us protect online free speech is greatly appreciated. With your help, we will maintain this platform as a free public resource for important free speech videos that we believe are crucial for human freedom and prosperity through the current pandemic and beyond.

He has also stockpiled 10,000 kg of raw material to manufacture Cesium Eliminator in a Texas warehouse, and plans to donate the finished product to help save lives in Texas when the next nuclear event occurs. No independent scientist in the world has done more research on the removal of radioactive elements from the human digestive tract.

Adams is a person of color whose ancestors include Africans and American Indians. He is of Native American heritage, which he credits as inspiring his “Health Ranger” passion for protecting life and nature against the destruction caused by chemicals, heavy metals and other forms of pollution.

Adams is the author of the world’s first book that published ICP-MS heavy metals analysis results for foods, dietary supplements, pet food, spices and fast food. The book is entitled Food Forensics and is published by BenBella Books.

In his laboratory research, Adams has made numerous food safety breakthroughs such as revealing rice protein products imported from Asia to be contaminated with toxic heavy metals like lead, cadmium and tungsten. Adams was the first food science researcher to document high levels of tungsten in superfoods. He also discovered over 11 ppm lead in imported mangosteen powder, and led an industry-wide voluntary agreement to limit heavy metals in rice protein products.

In addition to his lab work, Adams is also the (non-paid) executive director of the non-profit Consumer Wellness Center (CWC), an organization that redirects 100% of its donations receipts to grant programs that teach children and women how to grow their own food or vastly improve their nutrition. Through the non-profit CWC, Adams also launched Nutrition Rescue, a program that donates essential vitamins to people in need. Click here to see some of the CWC success stories.

With a background in science and software technology, Adams is the original founder of the email newsletter technology company known as Arial Software. Using his technical experience combined with his love for natural health, Adams developed and deployed the content management system currently driving NaturalNews.com. He also engineered the high-level statistical algorithms that power SCIENCE.naturalnews.com, a massive research resource featuring over 10 million scientific studies.

Adams is well known for his incredibly popular consumer activism video blowing the lid on fake blueberries used throughout the food supply. He has also exposed “strange fibers” found in Chicken McNuggets, fake academic credentials of so-called health “gurus,” dangerous “detox” products imported as battery acid and sold for oral consumption, fake acai berry scams, the California raw milk raids, the vaccine research fraud revealed by industry whistleblowers and many other topics.

Adams has also helped defend the rights of home gardeners and protect the medical freedom rights of parents. Adams is widely recognized to have made a remarkable global impact on issues like GMOs, vaccines, nutrition therapies, human consciousness.

In addition to his activism, Adams is an accomplished musician who has released over fifteen popular songs covering a variety of activism topics.

20,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-20-plandemic-video-super-viral-brighteon-facebook-banning-cleansing-content-wuhan-coronavirus.html,Natural News,2020-05-20,['Mike Adams'],"After “Plandemic” video goes super viral on Brighteon.com, Facebook bans all Brighteon links, regardless of content",https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2020/05/plandemic.png,"(Natural News) Facebook has initiated a whole new level of tyranny and censorship to try to eliminate any information about the Wuhan coronavirus that disagrees with the World Health Organization, which is largely run by communist China and is currently led by a former member of a violent communist group.

Late last night, Facebook began banning all links from Brighteon.com, regardless of the content of the videos, claiming that videos about gardening and smoothie recipes and backyard chickens now violate Facebook’s “community guidelines.”

The real reason for the banning, of course, is that Brighteon.com hosts the “Plandemic” video featuring Dr. Judy Mikovits who warns about the dangers of the coronavirus vaccine. Users have posted a Portuguese version of the documentary that has achieved nearly a million views, and a Greek language version is also rapidly gaining hundreds of thousands of views.

The rapid explosion in people viewing the video has resulted in Facebook blacklisting the entire Brighteon platform, confirming Facebook is engaged in anti-trust behavior to try to crush competing platforms by starving them of user traffic. This is blatant criminal anti-trust behavior on the part of Facebook, and it is a direct attack on human knowledge and human freedom.

Even more importantly, both Facebook and YouTube now openly claim that any content which contradicts the “official” opinions of the W.H.O. will be banned, meaning Facebook and YouTube are now run by communist China, because that’s the anti-human rights regime that dictates the policies of the W.H.O.

Facebook scrubs all Natural News content posted since November of 2019

Adding to the extreme, punitive censorship, Facebook also banned all links from NaturalNews.com and NewsTarget.com while scrubbing all the content we have posted, back to November of 2019, which is the month in which the Wuhan coronavirus bioweapon was released by communist China.

Any attempt to post any link from Natural News or NewsTarget is now blocked by Facebook, and Facebook has scrubbed all our posts about the coronavirus in order to cover up communist China’s war against humanity.

In effect, Facebook is now covering up the bioweapons crimes of communist China by banning independent media publishers that are documenting China’s deliberate engineering and release of this weapon against humanity.

This puts Mark Zuckerberg in the same class as Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, actively carrying out crimes against humanity and defending an anti-human regime that builds weapons of mass destruction to cause mass death on a global scale. Mark Zuckerberg is an enemy of humanity and a criminal against all who value life and liberty.

We repeat our call for the arrest and prosecution of Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook and other tech giant CEOs that have engaged in malicious, anti-human censorship that protects communist China and the vaccine industry.

How to share the Plandemic video on Facebook and other platforms without getting banned

Because of the extreme level of criminal censorship being carried out by Facebook, YouTube, Google, Twitter and even Vimeo, the only current way to share Plandemic videos from Brighteon.com or other targeted platforms is to embed the videos on another website page, then share that page.

Each video on Brighteon.com has a “share” link at the bottom right-hand corner:

From the share link, you can copy either the direct link to the video play page or get embed code that embeds the video into any web page. This code can be pasted into the HTML code of any page, including pages that are edited in WordPress or other page editors.

Here’s an example of the embed code for the Plandemic video from the “Jesus Social” channel on Brighteon:

<iframe src=’https://www.brighteon.com/embed/45c1558c-4163-4961-9f92-11c7c4c1af21′ width=’560′ height=’315′ frameborder=’0′ allowfullscreen></iframe>

And here’s the embedded video it produces when you add this code to your web page:

Once the video is embedded in your page, you can then share that page on Facebook or other platforms.

You can also, of course, share Brighteon links on Gab.com and other alternative internet ecosystems that aren’t run by evil globalists working for communist China.

In the future, we will also have alternate URLs and domain names that will allow you to share Brighteon videos, but those domains will of course be eventually banned by Facebook and the other tech giants, all of which are criminal operations that are complicit in communist China’s war against humanity.

The tech giants will not stop until they succeed in destroying humanity and achieving mass death across the globe

We have now arrived at a very dark chapter in human history where the gatekeepers who control online speech are protecting the very communist regime that has declared war on humanity through the deliberate deployment of engineered bioweapons. Mark Zuckerberg and other big tech globalists are criminals against humanity, and they no longer even pretend to support free speech. Instead, they brazenly censor all platforms and publishers that are working to blow the whistle on global criminals who wield weapons of mass destruction against the innocent.

This is why today, we are repeating our call for the arrest and prosecution of Mark Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Google, YouTube, Twitter and Vimeo for their conspiracy against humankind and their deliberate, malicious crimes against human freedom and human survival.

Human freedom cannot coexist with these evil, anti-human regimes. We either dismantle the tech giants and imprison their architects and leaders, or humanity dies in darkness.

Even if it is his last act, President Trump must deploy military police to arrest the CEOs of the tech giants and prosecute them under military tribunals for their crimes against humanity. Trump must order the US State Department to seize the domain names of all the tech giants engaged in malicious censorship, halting their operations until they restore First Amendment protections on their platforms. In just 24 hours, Trump could order the US government to seize Google.com, Apple.com, Twitter.com, YouTube.com, Vimeo.com and all the other domains run by the techno-fascists, and he could force them to either respect the First Amendment or be permanently put out of business.

And no, that isn’t tyranny on the part of government, not when the only demand is that tech platforms must respect the freedoms described in the Bill of Rights. For the free world to thrive, Sec. 230 must be dismantled and free speech must be affirmed across the internet, or humanity has no future other than death and tyranny.

That’s the whole plan behind the coronavirus, of course: To unleash mass death, tyranny and censorship, carrying out a new holocaust against billions of innocent people so that globalists can achieve their depopulation dreams.

Watch my recent interview with Dr. Judy Mikovits to find out why globalists are so afraid of this woman that they are blacklisting entire platforms to prevent her voice from being heard:

No, you won’t be able to share this story on Facebook. That’s by design. You might be able to share it from this alternative URL at Trump.news:

What can we do?,https://naturalnewsblogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Cancer-Cell-Attack-Body-Virus-Bacteria.jpg,"It is incredible, to say the least, everything that is happening worldwide. Undoubtedly it is hard to believe that this is even real. Sometimes I think we are in a bad dream hoping to wake up soon. As a mother, the first thing that comes to mind is my family’s safety. Understanding and implementing every precaution possible to protect my children is my top priority. Of course, due to my personal journey and now as a wellness blogger and health advocate I can’t help to wonder how much of impact this COVID-19 disease may have on cancer patients.

We already know that cancer patients are immune-compromised, to begin with. Therefore, cancer patients automatically fall in the higher risk category. But what about those that are in the treatment and those that are in remission? According to a small study conducted in Wuhan, China, “Cancer patients show deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes from the COVID-19 infection,” the study, which was recently published in the Annals of Oncology, states. “It is recommended that cancer patients receiving anti-tumor treatments should have vigorous screening for COVID-19 infection and should avoid treatments causing immunosuppression or have their dosages decreased in case of COVID-19 co-infection.”

Furthermore, researchers found “more than half (53.6%) of the patients involved in the study developed severe events—defined by admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, or death—with 28.6% of the patients dying. This is far higher than the general COVID-19-infected population, which has an average clinically critical status rate of 4.7%, and a mortality rate of 2.3%.”

Researchers also wrote, “Patients with lung cancer, with worse baseline lung function and endurance, are more likely to develop more severe anoxia and progress more rapidly with COVID-19”

I’m not a researcher but my common sense tells me that the conclusion found on this small study conducted ironically enough in Wuhan China makes a lot of sense. Of course, the outcome for cancer patients would be poor and more challenging if dealing with the COVID-19 in addition to cancer. This is why it is vital for patients to be proactive in their current treatment plan and implement a preventive plan not only to get tested but discuss with their medical/ oncology team the possibilities before continuing with immunosuppressing treatments, making themselves more vulnerable to COVID-19.

What Can We Do?

In one of my most recent blog articles titled “How to fight the Coronavirus naturally” I share additional helpful tips to help you boost your immunity and take additional precautions as a preventive mechanism for you to be safe during this crisis. Let me provide you with a quick summary:

Practice the following to prevent and protect from the virus:

• Social distancing (2 meters minimum) because the secretions that are the ones that contaminate cannot move more than 2 meters due to the weight of the virus.

• Correct handwashing, for 20 seconds (both surfaces, anterior-posterior, interfaces, and fingertips) each time you come from outside or enter or leave any public space.

• Use of masks when traveling through crowded areas (supermarkets, banks, hospitals, etc.)

• Clean surfaces with disinfectant (especially those that may be in common and frequent contact)

Boost your Immune System

Keeping our immunity strong is most definitely the best form of prevention and our strongest defense when facing any sort of illness that threatens our lives. Here are some powerful and amazing tips to help you boost your immunity:

Take a good Probiotic

Take Vitamin D3

Vitamin C IV therapy

Take Camu Camu Powder

Take Beta Glucan

Eat Adaptogens like Maca

Follow a Plant-based Diet

Mild Exercise

Rebound

Infrared Sauna

Chiropractic Care

Colloidal Silver

Water

If you like to learn more about each one of those recommendations read my article on “How to fight the Coronavirus Naturally.” I hope you find this blog article helpful and as always I welcome your comments and I really appreciate you sharing your experiences with me. Sending much love, blessings, peace and protection prayers for you and your families. Stay strong, stay safe, and stay healthy.",12.5,Very low,,USA,0
22,https://naturalnewsblogs.com/how-to-fight-the-coronavirus-naturally/,Natural News,2020-03-27,['Karen Berrios'],How to Fight the Coronavirus Naturally,https://naturalnewsblogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Vitamin-D-Fruits.jpg,"As this global concern grows by the minute so should your concern to take action into protecting yourself and your loved ones from this worldwide threat. According to the most recently published article by JAMA (An International peer-reviewed medical journal association), the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that results from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Furthermore, the article shares that following initial reports of disease outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread worldwide with cases identified in at least 67 countries across 6 continents. So if this is an acute respiratory illness why is the world-wide population running out of toilet paper? Ok, I must admit this is funny but not really!

What is coronavirus disease 2019?

According to the CDC, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. The virus that causes COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was first identified during an investigation into an outbreak in Wuhan, China. It spreads from person to person and the risk of infection lies if you are in close contact with someone that has it. As of March 27th, 2020, the CDC has reported 68,440 total cases nationwide. Travel-related cases 636, close contact related 1,074, and under investigation 66,730 cases.

What are the Symptoms?

It looks like the symptoms are similar to a cold or the flu, with fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

Can a Virus be killed?

This is could totally fall under a trick question category. I’ve gotten different feedback from my circle of doctors and honestly after many physician surveys and personal research, it is my opinion that the answer to this tricky question is NO. Viruses can’t function without interacting with a living cell. On their own, they’re also essentially inert — unable to move. According to The National Human Genome Research Institute, “A virus is an infectious agent that occupies a place near the boundary between the living and the nonliving. It is a particle much smaller than a bacterial cell, consisting of a small genome of either DNA or RNA surrounded by a protein coat. Viruses enter host cells and hijack the enzymes and materials of the host cells to make more copies of themselves. Viruses cause a wide variety of diseases in plants and animals, including AIDS, measles, smallpox, and polio.” In order for viruses to thrive and live these must find a host. This article further explains a virus is a small infectious agent that can only replicate inside the cells of another organism. Viruses are found wherever there is life and have probably existed since living cells first evolved. Viruses do not have their own metabolism and require a host cell to make new products. In other words, once a virus finds a host, the host and virus go into war and let the stronger one win.

Is there a Vaccine or Treatment for the Coronavirus?

NOPE! There is no vaccine or antiviral treatment against COVID-19. The best cure is prevention! Below I share my preventive tips for you and your loved ones to follow as preventive means to this worldwide threat.

The Fear Factor

It is amazing to me to see how our human nature so easily gravitates to fear mode and we are easily triggered to respond from a place of fear versus reasoning or just common sense. Although there’s much evidence that indicates that fear suppresses our immunity somehow social panic continues to prevail in the face of this so-called worldwide threat. Keep in mind that we are modeling to our children how to react in the face of challenging circumstances. Perhaps behind the scenes of this pandemic virus hides the acts of cleverly masked and highly manipulative private organizations, selective groups and why not even governments. I guess there is no way to know for sure but what we do know for sure is that through technology and social media we can get up-to-date worldwide news and respond quickly to life-altering events such as the Coronavirus outbreak.

How can We Protect Ourselves?

As I have said there’s no magic bullet to fight off this COVID-19 virus. A study published by The Journal of Hospital Infection found that the virus can linger on surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days. However, it can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures. The most important line of defense you and I have against it is to be proactive to follow some specific precautions and most definitely boost our immune system. Here are some steps to implement and follow immediately:

Avoid exposure (stay home / avoid crowded places)

Keep social distance

Wash hands often with soap for at least 20 seconds

Disinfect surfaces with household cleaning products

Use disposable utensils

Do not touch your eyes, nose, and mouth

Cover your cough and sneeze

Avoid contact with sick people

Stay home and wear a mask if you are sick

Make children feel safe and share facts with them

Empathy is key

Try to maintain a normal routine

Model the behavior you want to see

Take care of yourself by boosting your immunity

How can I Boost my Immune System?

A healthy immune system is key to protect ourselves from ALL kinds of diseases. Keeping our immunity strong is most definitely the best form of prevention and our strongest defense when facing any sort of illness that threatens our lives. Boosting our immune system is a great way to keep us healthy and ready in the face of something like the COVID-19. Here are some powerful and amazing tips to help you boost your immunity:

Take a good Probiotic

As you probably know, your immune system begins in the gut. Did you know that 80% of your immune system is in your gut? Gut health has overwhelmingly been linked to the health of your immune system. Because of the foods we eat, and the chemicals in our environment,

no matter how hard we work to create toxin-free homes, the good bacteria in the gut of the average modern person is overwhelmingly low. A good source of probiotics can cause that community of good bacteria to flourish in your gut, providing continual nourishment of the immune system.

The Power of Beta 1,3D Glucan

Beta-Glucans are one of the greatest weapons ever introduced to the immune system. Beta 1,3D Glucan helps reduce free radicals, can act as an antioxidant, and it’s effective in supporting the immune system by:

Helps naturally modulate a healthy immune system

Helps reduce free radicals and can act like an antioxidant

Effective in supporting the immune system: Increases t-cell production Enhances macrophages Enhances natural killer cell functionality



Vitamin D3 a must-have

Vitamin D supplementation has been proven to assist with immune system health. A lack of vitamin D is associated with a multitude of health problems: cancer, auto-immune disease, osteoporosis, and multiple infectious diseases, just to name a few. Researchers have found that Vitamin D:

Regulates the enzymes in your brain that help with nerve growth, neurotransmitter production, and synaptic density. These are all things that are essential for brain health.

It helps maintain intracellular calcium and phosphorus levels.

Protects your nervous tissue from oxidative stress.

It helps control your immune system response.

And more.

Camu Camu as your natural source of Vitamin C

This Peruvian berry is found in the wilderness of the Amazon rainforest. Camu Camu contains more immune-boosting and inflammation-fighting Vitamin C than any other food. In powdered form, just one single teaspoonful of the powerful berry contains 1200% of your daily recommended minimum Vitamin C!

The Immune Benefits of MACA

Also, known as a powerful adaptogen, this Peruvian superfood is a well-known immune booster for its ability to increase glutathione production known to improve immune function and cause disease resistance. Maca is a cruciferous vegetable and therefore related to broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and kale. It has a long history of medicinal use in Peru.

Exercise

When you exercise, the number of white blood cells can increase, which increases your disease-fighting arsenal. It has also been suggested that any exercise that increases your breathing and heart-rate can flush toxins out of your lungs, making it more difficult for cold and flu to take hold, and less likely that a secondary infection will develop from viruses.

Infrared Sauna

I am so blessed to have one at home, as this therapy can help you not only to detoxify the body and stimulate your immune system and immune response, but it is also known to get rid of bacteria and viruses.

Conclusion

I sincerely hope you have found this article helpful and as always I encourage you to send me your comments in the box below. Sending you lots of love and peace during this difficult season. Stay safe and stay healthy!
