Even though President Trump has said that Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines will not be mandated at the federal level, there is still the possibility that some states may try to force them locally, which will put not just those opposed to vaccination in a tough position but also those who recognize the sanctity of unborn human life.

After it was announced recently that Canada’s largest federal research and development organization has teamed up with a Chinese vaccine company to test a new trial coronavirus vaccine in Canada, Dr. Alan Moy, M.D., founder and scientific director of the John Paul II Medical Research Institute and CEO of Cellular Engineering Technologies decided to do some digging, upon which he discovered that the test vaccine in question is made from aborted fetal cell lines.

CanSino Biologics Inc., also known as CanSinoBIO, is the name of the Chinese firm that partnered up with Canada’s National Research Council (NRC) to conduct trials on Ad5-nCoV, as it is being called, which Dr. Moy found contains a cell line known as HEK293 that was derived from unborn children that were murdered while still inside their mothers’ wombs.

“Since it’s using an adenovirus replication-defective vector, it is using HEK293,” Dr. Moy told LifeSiteNews. “HEK293 is an aborted fetal cell line.”

What’s worse, Ad5-nCoV probably won’t even work

Besides its unethical origins, the Ad5-nCoV more than likely will not even work as promised, Dr. Moy warns. As it turns out, there is a high incidence of immunity against Ad5, so most of the people who are injected with it will confer no protection whatsoever against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

“I don’t envy Canadians,” Dr. Moy is further quoted as saying. “Your government and PM (prime minister) have mandated draconian policies that are anti-life … Not a good vaccine solution if pro-life or pro-choice.”

What is further confounding is the fact that Canada would even agree to contract with a vaccine company based out of China, which is where this whole crisis originated. Ad5-nCoV was reportedly also co-developed by the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology which, like all other Chinese institutions, is governed and controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

This vaccine is said to be the first “phase 2” coronavirus vaccine, meaning it has been approved to be “safely” used in human test subjects. And the Canadian government could not be more excited about the prospect of injecting as many Canadians as possible with it to “cure” them of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

“NRC is proud of our ongoing partnership with CanSino Biologics,” stated NRC President Iain Stewart in a recent press release.

Dr. Xuefeng Yu, chairman and CEO of CanSinoBIO, also stated in the same press release that his company has “strong connections to Canada” and is “proud to be building on past successes and continuing our ongoing partnership with the NRC to address health needs on a global scale.”

Amazingly, both the NRC and CanSinoBIO are proud of their proprietary HEK293 aborted baby cell line, which they say will help “to advance a scale-up production process for the vaccine candidate.” In other words, thanks to these aborted babies, Canada and China will be able to produce Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines for mass distribution much faster than normal, paving the way for a global vaccination campaign unlike anything the world has ever seen.

Are you ready for this week’s absurdity? Here’s our Friday roll-up of the most ridiculous stories from around the world that are threats to your liberty, risks to your prosperity… and on occasion, inspiring poetic justice.

The United Nations takes a page from 1984 with a list of offensive words

According to the United Nations, the word “wife” is apparently offensive to some people. So is “husband”.

Their reasoning? Those words are not gender-neutral. So to “create a more equal world,” the UN has published an initial list of 14 words they want you to stop using… as well as the acceptable substitute.

The word manpower is offensive, naturally, because it relies on the base “man”. And anything that has to do with a man is offensive and terrible in this new world of ours.

So instead of “manpower”, the UN wants you to say “workforce”.

Same with congressman. Though frankly the word ‘congress’ should be far more offensive than ‘man’. But nevertheless, the UN wants you to say ‘legislator’.

Instead of husband or wife, the UN wants you to say “spouse.”

In regards to this website, somehow “Sovereign Gender Fluid Homo Sapien” doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue.

Oregon lockdown lifted… for a few hours

A judge ruled that Oregon Governor Kate Brown’s lockdown order could only go so far.

After 28 days, emergency decrees in Oregon require legislative approval. But Governor Brown did not receive that approval.

So a group of Oregon churches who were forced to close due to the shelter-in-place order sued the government. And the judge ruled in their favor– the entire state lockdown was ruled illegal, and the judge ordered that it be immediately lifted.

But that only lasted a few hours.

Governor Brown immediately appealed the ruling and took it to the state’s Supreme Court.

While the lower court’s ruling wasn’t overturned, the Supreme Court did cave to the Governor’s emergency motion to keep the lockdown in place while the lawsuit continued.

Of course, the Governor could have just called the legislature back to approve her lockdown order… or perhaps she was too afraid that the voters’ representatives would take her newfound power away?

It was a safer bet to let the Supreme Court decide, since Governor Brown appointed five of the seven justices.

Connecticut hires $2 million ‘reopening consultant’

There’s a lucrative new business opportunity in the Land of the Free: consulting state and local governments about how to re-open their economies.

How lucrative, you ask?

Well, the State of Connecticut has hired a consulting company to advise them on how to reopen the state after lockdown ends.

The state will pay a target of $2 million, which means it could end up being more.

But don’t worry, says Connecticut’s governor, because the state will likely be reimbursed by the federal government.

And why not?

The Fed is printing trillions of dollars worth of magic money.

What’s a measly $2 million to pay consultants to tell politicians how to stop being dictators?

New York tax revenue down $8 billion, or 68% compared to last April

Weird how when you shut down the economy, somehow the tax revenue stops flowing.

Tax revenue is down 68%, or almost $8 billion, compared to last April.

New York is now facing a yearly budget gap of $13.3 billion.

But New York did receive over $5 billion from the federal government’s CARES Act, and the city is already whining for more federal money.

Why did anyone ever work at all, when we could have just been printing money this whole time?

Restaurants are starting to collect customer info for contact tracing

Many American cities are considering forcing restaurants to collect information from patrons to assist in “contact tracing.”

That way, if someone who visited the restaurant is diagnosed with coronavirus, authorities can contact people who may have been exposed.

Customers must provide information like their name, phone number, address, and other contact information.

This is already required in some places, like Auckland, New Zealand. And it has already turned creepy.

One said she thought nothing of leaving her phone number, email address, and physical address at a Subway restaurant she visited.

Then she received a Facebook message, an Instagram request, and a text from a Subway staff member who wanted to take her on a date.

She was especially concerned because her home address was also available to the overzealous man.

And as creepy as that is, this is just one aspect of the privacy issues.

The government will also be able to track your whereabouts.

And unlike the creepy man from Subway, the government won’t let you ignore its advances.

Kansas City churches forced to keep records of attendees

It’s not just restaurants being forced to collect information on customers.

Churches in Kansas City, Missouri are now required to keep a list of church attendees.

That way, the state can look at the list for contact tracing if someone from the church tests positive for coronavirus.

The rule requires churches and synagogues to “record the names, contact information, and approximate entry/exit time of all customers who are on premises for more than 10 minutes.”

If a not-so-deadly virus can erase all the most basic rights– from assembly to religion– were we ever really free to begin with?

In the entire country, a record 38.6 million Americans have filed for unemployment during the pandemic. That corresponds to nearly 25% of the entire United States labor force. While many of these folks are receiving unemployment from state and federal government, many others are not.

Millions of Americans — who watched states close non-essential businesses, subsequently crushing their careers — cannot even access unemployment benefits, according to the Economic Policy Institute. While some of these problems have been remedied, for others, collecting unemployment insurance was never an option.

Business owners who were unable to obtain an SBC loan or other forms of COVID-19 government subsistence have been frantically fighting to reopen their business as they watched their life savings go up in flames. The Free Thought Project has reported on multiple instances in which people unable to obtain government support have tried to reopen their businesses to support themselves, only to leave them in handcuffs. It’s a catch-22.

Of those millions of jobless claims in the United States, over a quarter-million of them were in the state of Oklahoma. With a population just under 4 million, 275,000 unemployed residents are massive. While some of these folks have likely sought out and found jobs to support themselves and their families, others have likely endured conditions that may have prevented them from doing so.

As a result of the state shutting down the economy, these unemployed residents of the state have been unable to pay their bills, including their rent and house notes. Now, in spite of the fact that this record spike in unemployment was a function of the state’s COVID-19 measures, Oklahoma is taking action in the form of evictions.

On their Facebook page this week, the Oklahoma County Sheriff’s Office announced that they will begin physically evicting residents unable to pay their bills. It reads as follows:

EVICTION NOTICE UPDATE We know that this will be difficult, but want to give as much notice as possible regarding OCSO deputies serving eviction notices. Deputies will start serving judicial eviction orders this week, and enforcing evictions on May 26, 2020. We understand how tough times are currently for many as a result of the health crisis the past few months, but we must enforce orders issued by the courts. Once the order is served tenants have 48-hours to leave the premises of the residence they are renting/leasing. Please, if you are set for an eviction hearing, attend. Make your case to the judge, the only person who can determine your case. Civil process, and our issuing evictions is mandated by state law: https://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp… We will be compassionate, and respectful during scheduled evictions. We are hopeful that everyone issued an eviction will be able to make living arrangements.

Now, as the inevitable effects of the government’s shutdown order crash the economy and force people to choose between eating and paying their rent, that same government is going to start kicking them out of their homes.

See how that works?

As banks and other large corporations across the country receive hundreds of billions in Federal money — ensuring a lifetime of debt for future generations — Joe Sixpack on Main Street, USA is told to kick rocks.

RELATED: The Homosexual Rights Movement and Child Sexual Abuse

No one here is advocating for people to be able to squat and exploit this situation to get out of paying their house note or rent. However, that is not the case here. While grocery stores and fast-food restaurants are hiring, other businesses are told they must operate at 25% capacity or remain closed entirely. This is hardly sustainable when it comes to maintaining a decent workforce with substantial pay.

Unfortunately, this is likely the beginning of an economic snowball that will continue to grow as the next few months roll on. As TFTP has predicted from the beginning, the shutdown of the economy will have lasting consequences, unprecedented in nature, and that will be here for a long time. As this case in Oklahoma and countless other ones illustrate, the government’s promise of “safety” almost always ends in human suffering.

If you are a frequent Sons of Liberty Media connoisseur of the website, including the 6 AM Eastern and 3 PM Eastern radio shows, you have heard and read the stance on work – all work is essential; work honors God as He commands us to work; and, government has no authority to determine whether you can work or not.

However, some State governors, like Gretchen “Hitler” Whitmer, have usurped their authority by assuming the power to determine which businesses can open and which cannot, meaning it’s strictly subjective. How else can one explain why a homosexual, sodomite “swinger’s” club can remain open while “Hitler” Whitmer rabidly targets a 77-year-old barber? Yes, you read that correctly. An individual who cuts hair and follows strict cleaning protocols for the coronavirus hoax has lost his license, preventing him from earning a living, while the local homosexual, sodomite swinger’s club, Club Tabu remains open.

Megan Fox, writing for PJ Media, has the story.

There is perhaps nothing more confusing than Democrat governors’ orders during the Chinese WuFlu pandemic. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer is by far the worst. That was made clear with the news that a gay swinger’s club with “glory holes” is being allowed to operate under her nose in Lansing while she aims her business-killing death ray on 77-year-old barber Karl Manke for giving haircuts.

Gay swinger’s club is essential.

But strangers servicing each other through holes in a basement wall in the state capitol is perfectly fine. I guess group sex is an “essential” activity in the Democrat-run state of Michigan. The underground private club, Club Tabu, has a website that describes what goes on there. (HT: Steve Gruber)

This homosexual sodomite swinger’s club describes events as “private party” lifestyle socials and prohibits sexual activity except in private accommodations. Well, that’s certainly better – NOT, Here’s the big question – If a barber shop cannot open because of violating social distancing “orders” despite the wearing of masks and rigorous cleaning protocols, how does a homosexual sodomite swinger’s club that engages in sexual activity not in violation of those same tyrannical decrees?

Unlike Manke, who is sterilizing everything in his barbershop and wearing a mask to cut hair, Club Tabu has no announcement on their social media about what precautions they are taking, if any, to keep people who are engaging in full body contact with strangers safe. In fact, the only messaging they are giving is that they are open. The website FAQ’s says, “Yes, we are still open; if this website is still up – we are open!!!”

No way was this writer going to “google” anything regarding the holes the basement walls because no need was seen in spreading the debauchery. And, the club does not even announce any precautions on the website – a site unpleasant to visit but necessary to check sources. Here’s the real kicker. Someone posted in the comment section the club should reconsider their precaution and open stance because of the close proximity of people. The club responded, “Data proves different. Additionally, we are a private club and if our members want to visit we will welcome them”.

To be fair, Fox, through PJ Media, attempted to contact the club to verify it being open since a review placed a “patron” there on May 14th. However, there was no answer, but the conclusion drawn, based on the information on the website, indicates the club is in full operation and open.

Fox deduced this is not about health, which is something the alternative media has been saying almost since day one. Where Michigan Governor Gretchen “Hitler” Whitmer is concerned, it is about ego, control, and revenge. This is a woman who sent six officers to serve Karl Manke orders to close his business for violating her “decrees” but can’t bring herself to send officers to Club Tabu to close that business for violating Queen Whitmer’s decree. Oh wait, homosexual sodomite swinging is essential while barber/beauty shops are not.

Fox continues saying:

Our leaders have been giving us incredibly bad advice since this coronavirus pandemic happened including Dr. Fauci himself who insists we all stay in our houses and not see our parents or family members for their own safety while he and the state of New York have given very weird advice about sex and COVID-19. We were told we can’t have lunch with Grandma, but we can have sex with strangers. Seems legit. The New York Post reported:

Toward the end of the taped segment, Fauci was asked: “If you’re swiping on a dating app like Tinder, or Bumble or Grindr, and you match with someone that you think is hot, and you’re just kind of like, ‘Maybe it’s fine if this one stranger comes over.’ What do you say to that person?”

“You know, that’s tough,” replied the befuddled National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director to the curveball. “Because that’s what’s called relative risk.”

Then he dropped the bombshell. “If you’re willing to take a risk — and you know, everybody has their own tolerance for risks — you could figure out if you want to meet somebody,” said Fauci, who was named a candidate for People magazine’s “Sexiest Man Alive” award.

He added, “If you want to go a little bit more intimate, well, then that’s your choice regarding a risk.”

The state of New York put out an equally bizarre guide to sex during the pandemic, which didn’t seem to adhere to social distancing guidelines. Read at your own risk. “You should avoid close contact — including sex — with anyone outside your household. If you do have sex with others, have as few partners as possible.”

The more investigation done into this coronavirus “non”pandemic hoax, the more we see none of these actions are about health, despite the government parading out a doctor who hasn’t seen a patient in 30 years and is a government shill and another doctor who doesn’t even hold an active license in any US State telling us otherwise. This is about control – who will follow like the cowardly sheep they are and who will stand up for freedom, liberty, and God-given individual unalienable rights. Moreover, the government learns who is also apathetic, caring not which way the wind blows.

And, while much of the population is nestled, all snug in their forced “house arrest” and others run around wearing masks, over using hand sanitizer, government at all levels are busy little bees, while both Chambers of Congress not being altogether as the Constitution requires for passing of legislation, presenting pre-written bills by lobbyist that are passed without anyone reading them and sent off to the President’s desk where he is sure to sign them all.

Pastor are being arrested along with salon shop owners despite following the null and void “rules” except the one to keep church and governor-designated businesses closed. Church congregation members have been ticketed for attending services and law enforcement have even taken license plate numbers in order to citation the car owners. Church and hair establishments are verboten, but businesses catering to homosexual sodomite swinging orgies are open without restrictions.

Not to be taking sides here, but Club Tabu did get it right when indicating the data does not support the level of measures governors and the feds have “decreed” upon the people. Being a “private club” has nothing to do with whether you follow unconstitutional decrees or not. Neither does any other business the public enters. How could it when one is dealing with a hoax? This coronavirus hoax is being used as the catalyst to rapidly implement an agenda created by opportunistic globalists to crush the united States in every way possible.

For this agenda, Whitmer is the poster female governor idiot. If one wonders what fascist communism looks like as far as the social aspect, look no further than Gretchen Whitmer. If people do not get enraged by the fact that homosexual sodomite swinger club “Tabu” is open for business while law enforcement, under orders, descended upon a 77-year-old barber to shut his business doors, there is little hope for a return to a pre-hoax normal.

Her video, which has since been reinstated, featured doctors discussing the media’s politicization of the drug and how that interferes with research into potential treatment or prevention against Covid-19.

Sharyl: Camps largely divided along political lines. Many right-leaning media figures sided with hydroxychloroquine while the left-leaning press backed remdesivir. Each accusing the other of ignoring real science. Dr. William O’Neill: I’ve never seen science politicized in 40 years of practice.

Several doctors have stepped forward to discuss the difficulty of attempting to study hydroxychloroquine in a hyperpolitical media climate.

“We’re hearing now from some participants that the study and the drugs feel too political, and they just don’t want to participate at all,” exclaimed Christine Johnston, a researcher at the University of Washington.

While researching the financial ties of several government experts in charge of drafting treatment guidelines for the virus, Attkisson found that nine of them had ties to Gilead, the manufacturer of remdesivir. Another 11 were reportedly linked to a drug company and seven, including two committee leaders had direct ties to Gilead, and two were even on Gilead’s advisory board.

Sharyl: All three scientists criticized that VA report casting doubt on hydroxychloroquine as little more than a list of cases with crucial details missing. It turns out one author of the report received research funding from Gilead, the maker of remdesivir, including a 247-thousand dollar grant in 2018. Orient: I think we have to look at the money. There’s no big profits made in hydroxychloroquine. It’s very cheap, easy to manufacture, been around for 70 years. It’s generic. Remdesivir is a new drug that could be very expensive and very lucrative if it’s ever approved. So, I think we really do have to consider there’s some financial interest involved here. [SOURCE]

YouTube has been notorious lately for censoring content which goes against the official stance of the World Health Organization (WHO) or other governmental authorities on the pandemic. Not only have famous interviews with David Icke been removed, followed by a subsequent ban from the platform, but an NBC press briefing with California doctors was taken down after receiving over 5 million views, and the film Plandemic featuring Dr. Judy Mikovits has been severely targeted.

Facebook has also been cracking down on coronavirus related content, as Sharyl highlights in an April Facebook post. Upon sharing a documentary from The Epoch Times, Facebook ‘fact-checkers’ claimed that Attkisson posted false content about the origin of the coronavirus, but the article used to ‘debunk’ her was written before the documentary had even aired.

“When self-appointed fact-checkers intervene to try to stop people from accessing certain information, or to bully and controversialize those who report and read facts that are off the narrative powerful interests are trying to forward, it should be concerning to all.” – Sharyl Attkisson

The agency noted that they do not have any specific safety concerns about the product, but said that they still needed to do some research to ensure that the tests were safe.

The program in question is known as the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN) and they are now being asked to put their operation on hold until proper authorization is obtained. This also means that patients who have already sent in their tests will not be able to receive their results until the authorization has been given. SCAN is promising that this shut down is only temporary.

SCAN’s website stated that, “The FDA has not raised any concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of SCAN’s test, but we have been asked to pause testing until we receive that additional authorization.”

SCAN was sending out free test kits to potential patients, including people who were asymptomatic, hoping to obtain some data on how the coronavirus spreads through people who don’t show symptoms.

In a statement announcing the finer details of the program last week, Gates said that, “As SCAN gathers more test results in the weeks ahead, researchers expect the new data to provide a better sense of the number of infections and serve as one source to help answer other questions, like when physical distancing measures can be relaxed.”

However, an FDA shut down order came within days of the announcement, and the details behind the order are still unclear. The United States has been slow to get started with mass testing, especially of asymptomatic individuals, and the tests are mostly controlled by government agencies like the CDC. The tests currently available have also been criticized for being inaccurate. Just last week, the FDA issued a warning about tests made by Abbott Laboratories, saying that they often gave falsely negative results.

Late last night, Facebook began banning all links from Brighteon.com, regardless of the content of the videos, claiming that videos about gardening and smoothie recipes and backyard chickens now violate Facebook’s “community guidelines.”

The real reason for the banning, of course, is that Brighteon.com hosts the “Plandemic” video featuring Dr. Judy Mikovits who warns about the dangers of the coronavirus vaccine. Users have posted a Portuguese version of the documentary that has achieved nearly a million views, and a Greek language version is also rapidly gaining hundreds of thousands of views.

The rapid explosion in people viewing the video has resulted in Facebook blacklisting the entire Brighteon platform, confirming Facebook is engaged in anti-trust behavior to try to crush competing platforms by starving them of user traffic. This is blatant criminal anti-trust behavior on the part of Facebook, and it is a direct attack on human knowledge and human freedom.

Even more importantly, both Facebook and YouTube now openly claim that any content which contradicts the “official” opinions of the W.H.O. will be banned, meaning Facebook and YouTube are now run by communist China, because that’s the anti-human rights regime that dictates the policies of the W.H.O.

Facebook scrubs all Natural News content posted since November of 2019

Adding to the extreme, punitive censorship, Facebook also banned all links from NaturalNews.com and NewsTarget.com while scrubbing all the content we have posted, back to November of 2019, which is the month in which the Wuhan coronavirus bioweapon was released by communist China.

Any attempt to post any link from Natural News or NewsTarget is now blocked by Facebook, and Facebook has scrubbed all our posts about the coronavirus in order to cover up communist China’s war against humanity.

In effect, Facebook is now covering up the bioweapons crimes of communist China by banning independent media publishers that are documenting China’s deliberate engineering and release of this weapon against humanity.

This puts Mark Zuckerberg in the same class as Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, actively carrying out crimes against humanity and defending an anti-human regime that builds weapons of mass destruction to cause mass death on a global scale. Mark Zuckerberg is an enemy of humanity and a criminal against all who value life and liberty.

We repeat our call for the arrest and prosecution of Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook and other tech giant CEOs that have engaged in malicious, anti-human censorship that protects communist China and the vaccine industry.

How to share the Plandemic video on Facebook and other platforms without getting banned

Because of the extreme level of criminal censorship being carried out by Facebook, YouTube, Google, Twitter and even Vimeo, the only current way to share Plandemic videos from Brighteon.com or other targeted platforms is to embed the videos on another website page, then share that page.

Each video on Brighteon.com has a “share” link at the bottom right-hand corner:

From the share link, you can copy either the direct link to the video play page or get embed code that embeds the video into any web page. This code can be pasted into the HTML code of any page, including pages that are edited in WordPress or other page editors.

Here’s an example of the embed code for the Plandemic video from the “Jesus Social” channel on Brighteon:

<iframe src=’https://www.brighteon.com/embed/45c1558c-4163-4961-9f92-11c7c4c1af21′ width=’560′ height=’315′ frameborder=’0′ allowfullscreen></iframe>

And here’s the embedded video it produces when you add this code to your web page:

Once the video is embedded in your page, you can then share that page on Facebook or other platforms.

You can also, of course, share Brighteon links on Gab.com and other alternative internet ecosystems that aren’t run by evil globalists working for communist China.

In the future, we will also have alternate URLs and domain names that will allow you to share Brighteon videos, but those domains will of course be eventually banned by Facebook and the other tech giants, all of which are criminal operations that are complicit in communist China’s war against humanity.

The tech giants will not stop until they succeed in destroying humanity and achieving mass death across the globe

We have now arrived at a very dark chapter in human history where the gatekeepers who control online speech are protecting the very communist regime that has declared war on humanity through the deliberate deployment of engineered bioweapons. Mark Zuckerberg and other big tech globalists are criminals against humanity, and they no longer even pretend to support free speech. Instead, they brazenly censor all platforms and publishers that are working to blow the whistle on global criminals who wield weapons of mass destruction against the innocent.

This is why today, we are repeating our call for the arrest and prosecution of Mark Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Google, YouTube, Twitter and Vimeo for their conspiracy against humankind and their deliberate, malicious crimes against human freedom and human survival.

Human freedom cannot coexist with these evil, anti-human regimes. We either dismantle the tech giants and imprison their architects and leaders, or humanity dies in darkness.

Even if it is his last act, President Trump must deploy military police to arrest the CEOs of the tech giants and prosecute them under military tribunals for their crimes against humanity. Trump must order the US State Department to seize the domain names of all the tech giants engaged in malicious censorship, halting their operations until they restore First Amendment protections on their platforms. In just 24 hours, Trump could order the US government to seize Google.com, Apple.com, Twitter.com, YouTube.com, Vimeo.com and all the other domains run by the techno-fascists, and he could force them to either respect the First Amendment or be permanently put out of business.

And no, that isn’t tyranny on the part of government, not when the only demand is that tech platforms must respect the freedoms described in the Bill of Rights. For the free world to thrive, Sec. 230 must be dismantled and free speech must be affirmed across the internet, or humanity has no future other than death and tyranny.

That’s the whole plan behind the coronavirus, of course: To unleash mass death, tyranny and censorship, carrying out a new holocaust against billions of innocent people so that globalists can achieve their depopulation dreams.

Watch my recent interview with Dr. Judy Mikovits to find out why globalists are so afraid of this woman that they are blacklisting entire platforms to prevent her voice from being heard:

No, you won’t be able to share this story on Facebook. That’s by design. You might be able to share it from this alternative URL at Trump.news:

A hospital in Tennessee that has been closed for nearly a year received $121,000 in COVID-19 relief money from the people of the US, and that unconstitutionally, while still owing $1.2 million in federal income taxes.

According to the Department of Health and Human Services, something else not authorized in the Constitution, the Rennova-owned Jamestown Regional Medical Center, which has been closed since June 13, 2019, received $121,722 in federal relief money from the unconstitutional coronavirus stimulus passed by Congress and signed by President Trump.

WTSP reports:

It’s not fair for them to direct money to a hospital that has currently no real ability to re-open and provide adequate and safe patient care,” former Jamestown nurse Miah Elmore said.

As the Rennova-owned hospital cashes taxpayer dollars, WBIR found it owes more than $1.2 million in unpaid federal taxes.

“It’s disgusting in a way,” former Jamestown nurse Karen Cooper said. “There are hospitals and things that are seeing the COVID patients that could’ve utilized that money.”

Cooper is part of a class-action lawsuit alleging Rennova did not pay Social Security or federal payroll taxes withheld from employee’s paychecks.

Rennova appears to be in deep financial trouble at the other two hospitals it runs, the Big South Fork Medical Center in Oneida and the Jellico Community hospital in Campbell County.

It is behind on federal taxes for both locations, with records indicating IRS liens of more than $4.4 million.

Despite the back taxes, Rennova said in financial filings last week the federal government gave it $7.4 million in taxpayer money through the coronavirus relief fund.

Did you get that?

The federal government unconstitutionally gave the corporation owning these hospitals $7.4 million of your money while they owed more than half of that in taxes!

Talk about crony capitalism!

It’s even worse than that.

The corporation also received another $2.3 million in payroll protection loans.

“While the Company currently believes that its use of the loan proceeds will meet the conditions for forgiveness of the loans, we cannot assure you that we will not take actions that could cause the Company to be ineligible for forgiveness of the loans, in whole or in part,” Rennova said in a financial filing.

Can you believe that?

More than a week ago, HHS stated that it would “force repayment” of stimulus funds from closed institutions, but the real question is, why were they sent the funds in the first place if the hospital was closed?

Is anyone going to be held responsible, and I’m not necessarily talking about the hospital? I’m talking about the politicians that passed the unlawful legislation and the president that signed it?

Nope, cause everyone is just ok with thugs and thieves taking their money and spending it on things they never authorized them to spend it on.

This is not how you make American great.

It’s just another way that God is judging our country (Deuteronomy 28).

Of course, we knew then that the bill was anything but patriotic, however, that didn’t stop it from being passed and trampling all over the Constitution. The word “patriot” was perverted by those in power who wanted everyone to fall into lockstep with the unconstitutional searches at airports and many other invasions into our privacy.

Which brings us to another word that doesn’t mean what people think it means – it was all done in the name of “security.”

If you’ve been watching any type of media coverage or reading articles, you’ve probably seen or heard a plethora of words and phrases which are currently being perverted due to the coronavirus pandemic. I don’t know about you, but if I never heard “safe” or “new normal” again, I’d be a much happier person.

If you feel like people are being brainwashed through repetition, that’s because they are. Quite simply, these buzzwords and several others we’ll discuss are being used to indoctrinate the public. As Joseph Goebbels, the Reich Minister of Propaganda of Nazi Germany, wrote:

“If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.” (source)

We’re incredibly divided right now and the words are being as fuel to the fiery arguments taking place both online and in-person, during altercations in which one party feels the other party is being callous and horrible.

Let’s take a look at this hostile takeover of our vocabulary with a dozen words I’d like to have stricken from conversations, advertising, and the media.

The new normal

While it’s absolutely true we’re never going “back to normal” like we were before the pandemic, there’s a “new normal” being foisted upon us which is blatantly fueled by fear. Earlier on in the lockdown, I used this phrase a few times in reference to the economy. Sorry about that.

The “new normal” is most often used to get people to accept whatever unconstitutional or undignified rule that people in charge want us to find tolerable, like taped squares on the floor that we’re supposed to stand in while waiting in properly spaced lines. You know how cats will curl up in a taped-off square on the floor as though it was a box? Now they want humans to do that for the privilege of buying alcohol or food.

Other bizarre “new normal” activities are having your temperature taken by someone brandishing an infrared thermometer gun, scurrying around in a mask in stores trying to avoid other humans like you’re playing some kind of weird game of tag, and publicly shaming those who don’t act terrified because they clearly hate old people.

We’re all in this together

The saccharine phrases “we’re all in this together” or “we’re all in this together…apart” were bandied about early on in the lockdowns. Celebrities serenaded us badly with John Lennon songs. They made videos of themselves looking concerned at their mansions, telling us not to worry, because “we’re all in this together.” Except, of course, they still have millions of dollars in the bank and the rest of us weren’t supposed to go to work or open our businesses to make the money we need to survive.

Indeed, we all owe these celebrities an unfathomable debt of gratitude for reminding us that they, too, are “in this together.”

Social media outlets even made little frames for your profile pictures bearing those wildly annoying words. Articles encouraging us to hunker down in our homes reminded us that everyone, rich or poor, was “in this together” too. It’s just that the rich people were “in this together” on yachts and private islands while the rest of us crammed into the kitchen on Zoom meetings with our employers while banning our kids from streaming anything so we had enough internet.

Stay home.

Stay home. Just stay home.

How many times did you hear this phrase early in the lockdown? You probably lost count at umpteen million. #StayHome was a viral hashtag on Twitter, people ended social media status updates encouraging others to just “stay home,” and we were all told that if we didn’t “stay home” we were risking the lives of every person we loved and a few we hated because we were going to unconsciously spread the virus and kill people.

Clearly the only people who were asymptomatic were the a$$holes who wouldn’t “stay home.” They were COVID Marys and COVID Marks, thoughtlessly spreading illness to old people and kids with cancer merely because they wouldn’t just “stay home.”

In order to get us to all “stay home” stores in some states took to establishing what their government felt were “essential” purchases, and banning all other purchases even if you were already in the same store. (More on the word “essential” in a moment.) Thoughtless people didn’t realize if you only bought lettuce or a gallon of milk, you wouldn’t pass on your cooties. Cooties were only passed when you bought duvet covers or garden seeds.

Jeez. Stay home, you jerks.

Social distancing

Another phrase that makes me want to snarl viciously at those using it is “social distancing.” I’ll admit, I’ve always had an invisible personal space bubble I don’t like having invaded, but the whole social distancing thing means now that stores have arrows telling you which way you can walk down an aisle and the afore-mentioned taped boxes or Xs on the floor for standing in an appropriately social-distanced line.

Due to “social distancing” we spent months being unable to visit with loved ones, go into restaurants to eat, or go into the liquor store aisles to select our own much-needed whiskey. We’ll continue socially distancing in all sorts of ridiculous ways in the “new normal” future, with venues only allowing a small portion of their former capacity of customers inside at a time.

Six feet

Hand in hand with social distancing is the phrase “six feet.” If someone gets too close to you in the store, you can shout angrily from behind your mask, “Six feet, mofo!” and it’s perfectly acceptable. Six feet is the gold standard, the protective bubble that keeps you “safe” from getting COVID 19 when you can’t “stay home.”

All those Xs on the floor of stores are measured out to be six feet apart. Children returning to school will have to stay six feet away from other children while marching around the playground in dismal formation. Offices are being redesigned so everyone can stay six feet away from everyone else.

Essential

The word “essential” has also been corrupted. If you were able to keep working throughout the entire lockdown, it’s because you were an “essential” worker doing an “essential” job. “Essential” was defined separately by the governor of each state, so it varied from place to place. My daughter, who works in a beauty supply store, was initially not “essential” but a month in when everyone’s roots began to show, she became essential and got the travel papers to prove it.

The word “essential” was also used to describe purchases that the government felt were important enough for you to be allowed to make in person, and for trips outside the home. It was “essential” to go to the grocery store, the doctor, the pharmacy, and out to walk your dog. However, the dog had to be walked on neighborhood streets with all the other people essentially walking their dogs, instead of on a trail out in the forest alone, because the trails were closed because they weren’t essential.

Pivot

Depending on the business you’re in, you may have heard the word “pivot” until you wanted to vomit. Small businesses were super-busy “pivoting” to try and stay afloat while loans meant for them went to billionaires and giant corporations. You could “pivot’ by manufacturing something else – something “essential” like hand sanitizer – or by offering delivery or curbside pickup of your products.

Some of the “pivoting” was just different marketing. Buy this laundry soap, because we’re washing clothes for healthcare workers in it. Buy our car, because we support essential workers. Buy from us because here’s how we’re keeping our employees safe.

Other “pivots” were allowing people to work from home, supporting your customers in different ways, and selling goods from an appropriate social distance, like literally selling new vehicles over the internet and dropping them off in people’s driveways.

Uncertain or unprecedented times

How many emails could possibly have the subject line starting with “in these uncertain times” or “in these unprecedented times”?

It turns out, a whole lot. I can’t enumerate how many emails I got assuring me that various companies had my back in these “uncertain times.” Everyone from Victoria’s Secret to my internet service provider sent me a message letting me know how they were doing business in these “unprecedented times.”

Car brands had commercials about why you needed a particular vehicle during these uncertain times because we all definitely need a new car while the business that employs us is trying to pivot. Articles had headlines about handling these “uncertain times.” I confess, I too had an article about uncertainty early in the crisis. Again, sorry I used that word.

The continued use of this word makes people eager to latch on to anything that is “certain.” It makes them want to accept “the new normal” so they don’t have to be so “uncertain.” And since all this is “unprecedented” we have no idea what that “new normal” is going to be, so it can be anything, no matter how draconian.

Flatten the curve

When the lockdowns were first announced back in March, the entire goal was to “flatten the curve.” That meant that hospitals would not be overwhelmed like the hospitals in Italy and China. Instead of a graph going straight up into the stratosphere, we’d have a gentle hill, spacing out the illnesses.

Everything became about “flattening the curve.” You can’t “flatten the curve” while going about your business. CBS News explained (while using 4 of our least favorite words and phrases):

Communities are being urged to practice social distancing, some schools are closing, sports and cultural events are being canceled, and companies are asking employees to work from home — even if they’re not experiencing coronavirus symptoms. Many are wondering why they are essentially self-quarantined despite the fact that they’re not sick. The answer has to do with “flattening the curve” — an answer that could leave some people confused. You’ve likely seen “flattening the curve” graphs being used in articles and shared on social media as a way to explain the importance of responding aggressively to curb the spread of the coronavirus. But what does it mean to flatten the curve, and how do we do it? Friday on “CBS This Morning,” CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook explained what has become a buzzword in the wake of the outbreak. “Is it really worth while to do all of this social distancing and hand washing? The answer is yes,” Dr. LaPook said. “Normally, right now — without any measures — the epidemic might go up [sharply] and go down. That peak number of cases could overload the system and that’s what people are worried about.” (source)

Unfortunately, even after the curve was flattened across the nation in April, that was no longer sufficient. Many people are still stuck at home and many businesses are still unable to reopen.

Safe

The most overused word in this entire list of hijacked vocabulary has to be “safe.”

If taking a shot every time you heard or read the word “safe” was a drinking game, we’d all be wasted by 9:30 am. Out of all the words I never want to use again, “safe” is the penultimate. The word was already hijacked somewhat by the “safe spaces” nonsense where people were supposed to go when they felt vulnerable because somebody said something mean or wore a MAGA hat around them.

Now, “safe” has crossed the Rubicon. Every other article on the internet is about remaining “safe.” Church marquees want you to stay away from service to be “safe.” Instead of saying “bye” or “see ya later,” the salutation when someone is leaving is now an implorement to “stay safe.”

Some things that used to be okay but now aren’t safe are: kids playing at a playground, adults shaking hands with other adults when doing business, going for a hike, eating at a table in a restaurant, getting your hair cut, or basically having fun in any way beyond playing a wild game of Scrabble against those with whom you are “staying at home.”

You all know that Ben Franklin quote about safety and liberty. I’m not even going to quote it.

Dishonorable mentions: “curbing the spread” and “wash your hands”

While not used quite to the same dizzying level as the words above, I’m also pretty sick of hearing about “curbing the spread” of the coronavirus and “washing my hands.”

First of all, every business that sent me an “uncertain” or “unprecedented” email wanted me to know what they were doing to “curb the spread” of the virus. Every White House or gubernatorial press conference explained with deep sincerity how following all the rules would result in a “curb of the spread” of COVID19. (Of course, they also said the lockdown was only going to be for 2 weeks, and here we are finally emerging 60 days later in some parts of the country, almost as long a time as I predicted in the analysis I wrote back in March when a whole bunch of readers said I was nuts and angrily unsubscribed. Let me also note that the lockdown has not yet been completely lifted in several highly populated parts of the US.)

And I was already washing my hands, thank you very much. If you need to be told to wash your hands as an adult, you clearly missed out on some important childhood lessons.

This is what brainwashing is like.

If you ever wondered what it was like brainwashing somebody, this is what it’s like. Having the same words used over and over, words that used to mean something, until they begin to come out of your mouth too. When you consistently hear these phrases and the opposite of these phrases is used to incite irrational fear, that’s brainwashing.

I’m not being a paranoid, tinfoil-tiara-wearing nutcase when I tell you that we’re all the targets of a mass media operation to make us accept this draconian outrageous “new normal.” When you hear things over and over again, when you hear a script coming from the mainstream media, from social media, your sucker of a neighbor who snitches on kids playing outside, and when every other article has one or more of these words in the headline, there’s an agenda.

And that agenda is going to result in the loss of more freedom and the addition of more surveillance. (Anyone looking for a contact tracing job?)

I’m not saying that this virus wasn’t real or that it wasn’t a public health threat. It was. The fact that things didn’t get as bad as predicted doesn’t mean that the measures taken were entirely unnecessary – it means they worked. But it doesn’t mean that those measures need to be continued forever and ever.

However…as with all things, when the government gets a little bit of extra power and control, they become greedy for more. They didn’t let this crisis go to waste, and they aren’t letting any grass grow under their feet while they plot to make all this nonsense permanent.

A fearful, indoctrinated populace is a populace that is easy to control.

What words are driving you nuts?

What words or phrases make you want to fling yourself (or the person using them) into oncoming traffic?

Maybe I’m just cranky after being locked up for 2 months, but I’m stunned all my teeth have survived without being cracked as I clench my jaw in annoyance every time I hear or read these phrases.

If you catch yourself using these words, please, for the love of kittens, STOP. Stop perpetuating the propaganda. And if I missed any of the new buzzwords that annoy the snot out of you, please let me know in the comments. Which words would you like to see stricken from public discourse?

That same month, that woman from Michigan issued an executive order, that the Daily Show and SNL didn’t mention, “protecting” residents of long-term care facilities, by forcing nursing homes to admit patients infected with the coronavirus.

Her order dictated that a “long-term care facility must not prohibit admission or readmission of a resident based on COVID-19 testing requirements or results” and told hospitals to discharge coronavirus patients back to the homes they had come from. Some nursing homes were designated as ‘hubs’ and coronavirus patients were transferred into them, even though these facilities had uninfected residents.

Despite claims that these ‘hubs’ would carefully separate infected and uninfected patients, that didn’t always happen. While there had been a plan to move coronavirus seniors to the 1,000 bed TCF Center in Detroit which was being used as an overflow hospital for coronavirus patients, they were instead sent to nursing homes. The TCF Center only ended up treating 39 patients before being mothballed.

As of now, at least 687 nursing home residents in Michigan have died in the pandemic and 290 coronavirus patients have been placed in Michigan nursing homes. These numbers are incomplete.

Next time, Governor Whitmer goes on the Daily Show, she can wear a new t-shirt, “Grandma Killer”.

In New York, Governor Cuomo’s Health Department had issued an order on March 25th to “expand hospital capacity” by forcing nursing homes to “comply with the expedited receipt of residents returning from hospitals to NHs” and warned facilities that, “no resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to the NH solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19.”

It took over 5,000 deaths for Cuomo to partially reverse his grandma-killing policy which had killed 5% of residents of nursing homes in the state. It was a partial reversal, because nursing homes still couldn’t remove infected patients, but hospitals were no longer allowed to discharge infected patients to homes.

Cuomo has argued that no one should be prosecuted for nursing home deaths because they would have died anyway. “Older people… are going to die from this virus,” he argued, dismissing the outrage of the families of the dead. “I don’t think there’s any logical rationale to say that they would be alive today.”

“We’ve tried everything to keep it out of a nursing home, but it’s virtually impossible,” he falsely claimed.

His grandma-killing administration had tried everything, except providing protective equipment, not sending infected patients into nursing homes, or removing infected patients from nursing homes.

Cuomo had tried everything to stop killing grandmas, except not killing grandmas.

On March 31st, New Jersey Commissioner of Health Judith Persichilli issued an order stating that in order to achieve “the expedited receipt of patients/residents discharging from hospitals”, “no patient/resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to the post-acute care setting solely based on a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.” It was a virtual copy of the earlier New York State order.

New Jersey’s own nursing home death toll is approaching New York’s 5,000 death toll.

10,000 dead grandmas and grandpas haven’t dented the media’s adoration for Cuomo and Murphy. To paraphrase another leftist, a single dead grandma is a tragedy, 10,000 dead grandmas are a statistic.

But before New York and New Jersey had even made their move, Governor Tom Wolf’s grandma-killing administration had ordered Pennsylvania nursing homes to accept “readmissions for current residents who have been discharged from the hospital” in order to “alleviate the increasing burden in the acute care settings” including “patients who have had the COVID-19 virus.”

Wolf’s Secretary of Health, Dr. Richard (Rachel) Levine, had transferred his own mother out of a nursing home and to a hotel.

“Dr. Levine has done a phenomenal job of making sure that we do what we need to do in keeping Pennsylvanians safe,” Governor Wolf insisted.

That phenomenal job amounts to 2,529 coronavirus deaths in nursing homes or 68% of the state’s deaths.

On March 30th, Governor Newsom’s administration warned skilled nursing facilities that they “shall not refuse to admit or readmit a resident based on their status as a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case.”

“California’s directive is nothing less than a death sentence for countless residents,” warned Patricia McGinnis, executive director of California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform.

“I’m not taking in a COVID-positive patient for the sole purpose of emptying one hospital bed. In two weeks, I’m sending them back 20 new patients,” Dr. Noah Marco, the Chief Medical Officer of the Los Angeles Jewish Home, said. Half of California’s deaths, or 1,276, have occurred in nursing homes, though not all are the SNFs that were ordered to accept coronavirus patients.

Whitmer, Cuomo, Wolf, and Newsom have been widely praised by the media, even though their disastrous policies likely led to the deaths of thousands of senior citizens in nursing homes. There were states that got it right, protecting senior citizens by barring the transfer of coronavirus patients to nursing homes, requiring negative tests before a transfer, and creating separate facilities.

Cuomo, Wolf, Whitmer, and Newsom, not only failed to protect nursing home residents, but their forced readmission policy brought infected patients directly into nursing homes, leading to mass death.

5% of the residents in New York nursing homes are dead, that’s grandma-killing on a genocidal scale.

While New York had banned testing as a basis for nursing home admission, in Florida, a “COVID-19 test must be negative prior to transfer to a post-acute facility”.

Governor DeSantis noted that his ban on sending coronavirus patients to nursing homes is the reason why the nursing home death toll was 13 times higher in New York and 25 times higher in New Jersey.

The media falsely claims that after at least 12,000 dead grandmas and grandpas Cuomo, Whitmer, Murphy, and Newsom did a wonderful job, and DeSantis did a terrible one. Their measure of success isn’t in grandmas saved, but in small businesses shut down, people terrified, and government power made absolute.

And if the media gets to write the history of the pandemic, that is what our children will be taught.

They will learn that in an emergency, wise governors listening to learned experts deprived people of their civil liberties and stopped a catastrophe that could have been much worse. That revisionist history will become the model for handling future crises. A big lie paid for in countless thousands of lives.

The big lie must not be allowed to stand and the truth must shake our political system until it rings.

“Who can we prosecute for those deaths? Nobody. Mother Nature, God?” Cuomo asked rhetorically.

Governor Cuomo says that no one should be prosecuted for the nursing home deaths. He’s wrong. The prosecutions should begin with him and tear through the bureaucrats who made and implemented those decisions. Millions of people trusted Cuomo and other Democrat officials to keep them safe. Instead they seized power, abused their authority, and killed enough grandmas to fill miles of cemetery.

The grandma-killing governors must be brought to justice.

When a violent thug was shot by a police officer in a small city in Missouri, the Obama administration came down on Ferguson with an iron fist. How is it possible that thousands of nursing home residents can die, that grandmothers and grandfathers, that 127 veterans in New Jersey’s state-run nursing homes, that 5% of New York’s nursing home population can perish with less care than the concern about a thug?

What do we amount to as a country if we not only let that happen, but let them get away with it?

Thousands of men and women who worked all their lives and paid their taxes, who raised families, who wanted to watch their grandchildren grow up, died in large enough numbers that their bodies piled up in sheds, and the same nation that ground to a halt for Michael Brown and Freddie Gray shrugs. Where is even a fraction of the outrage that has been lavished on Ahmaud Aubrey for those thousands of wrinkled men and women, black and white, gasping out their last breaths in nursing home beds?

Cuomo, Whitmer, Murphy, and Newsom did not believe that they were worth saving. If we do not speak the truth, if we do not fight for justice for them, then are we as a nation really worth saving?

You have no rights.

That’s the lesson the government wants us to learn from this COVID-19 business.

Well, the government is wrong.

For years now, the powers-that-be—those politicians and bureaucrats who think like tyrants and act like petty dictators regardless of what party they belong to—have attempted to brainwash us into believing that we have no right to think for ourselves, make decisions about our health, protect our homes and families and businesses, act in our best interests, demand accountability and transparency from government, or generally operate as if we are in control of our own lives.

We have every right, and you know why? Because we were born free.

As the Declaration of Independence states, we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights—to life, liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness—that no government can take away from us.

Unfortunately, that hasn’t stopped the government from constantly trying to usurp our freedoms at every turn. Indeed, the nature of government is such that it invariably oversteps its limits, abuses its authority, and flexes its totalitarian muscles.

Take this COVID-19 crisis, for example.

What started out as an apparent effort to prevent a novel coronavirus from sickening the nation (and the world) has become yet another means by which world governments (including our own) can expand their powers, abuse their authority, and further oppress their constituents.

Until now, the police state has been more circumspect in its power grabs, but this latest state of emergency has brought the beast out of the shadows.

We are on a slippery slope to outright despotism.

This road we are traveling is paved with lockdowns, SWAT team raids, mass surveillance and forced vaccinations. It is littered with the debris of our First and Fourth Amendment freedoms.

This is what we have to look forward to in the months and years to come unless we can find some way to regain control over our runaway government.

The government has made no secret of its plans.

Just follow the money trail, and you’ll get a sense of what’s in store: more militarized police, more SWAT team raids, more surveillance, more lockdowns, more strong-armed tactics aimed at suppressing dissent and forcing us to comply with the government’s dictates.

It’s chilling to think about, but it’s not surprising.

We’ve been warned.

Remember that Pentagon training video created by the Army for U.S. Special Operations Command? The one that anticipates the future domestic political and social problems the government is grooming its armed forces to solve through the use of martial law?

The chilling five-minute training video, obtained by The Intercept through a FOIA request and made available online, paints a dystopian picture of the future bedeviled by “criminal networks,” “substandard infrastructure,” “religious and ethnic tensions,” “impoverishment, slums,” “open landfills, over-burdened sewers,” a “growing mass of unemployed,” and an urban landscape in which the prosperous economic elite must be protected from the impoverishment of the have nots.

But here’s the kicker: what they’re really talking about is martial law, packaged as a well-meaning and overriding concern for the nation’s security.

This COVID-19 crisis is pushing us that much closer to that dystopian vision becoming a present-day reality.

For starters, let’s talk about the COVID-19 stormtroopers, SWAT team raids and ongoing flare-ups of police brutality.

With millions of dollars in stimulus funds being directed towards policing agencies across the country, the federal government plans to fight this COVID-19 virus with riot gear, gas masks, ballistic helmets, drones, and hi-tech surveillance technology.

Indeed, although crime rates have fallen dramatically in the midst of this global COVID-19 lockdown, there’s been no relief from the brutality and violence of the American police state.

While the majority of the country has been social distancing under varying degrees of lockdowns, it’s been business as usual for the nation’s SWAT teams and police trained to shoot first and ask questions later.

In Kentucky, plain-clothed cops in unmarked cars used a battering ram to break down Breonna Taylor’s door and carry out a no-knock raid on her home after midnight. Fearing a home invasion, the 26-year-old emergency medical technician and her boyfriend—who had been in bed at the time of the invasion—called 911 and prepared to defend themselves. Taylor’s boyfriend shot one of the intruders—later identified as police—in the leg. Police fired at least 20 shots into the apartment and a neighboring home, killing Taylor. The drug dealer who was the target of the late-night raid lived 10 miles away and had already been arrested prior to the raid on Taylor’s home.

In Illinois, police opened fire in a subway station, shooting a 33-year-old man who allegedly resisted their attempts to tackle and arrest him for violating a city ordinance by passing between two cars of a moving train. Ariel Roman, a short-order cook, claimed he was suffering from an anxiety attack when he was “harassed, chased, tackled, pepper-sprayed, tasered and shot twice” by police.

In Maryland, police dispatched on a nuisance call to break up a crowd of neighborhood kids( half of them teenagers, and the other half youngsters around 4 and 5 years old) gathered in an apartment complex parking lot opened fire on a 29-year-old man seen exiting his car with a gun. An eyewitness claimed “the officer pointed a flashlight and his gun at the group immediately and began chasing and shooting a minute or two after getting out of the patrol car.” Police reportedly shot the man after he threw down his gun and ran in the opposite direction.

In Virginia, more than 80 local, state, and federal police agents risked spreading COVID-19 to “a highly vulnerable population” when they raided a low income, public housing community in an effort to crack down on six individuals suspected of selling, on average, $20 to $100 worth of drugs.

In Texas, a SWAT team backed up with a military tank Armored Personnel Carrier raided Big Daddy Zane’s Bar whose owner and patrons were staging a peaceful First and Second Amendment protest of the governor’s shutdown orders.

Police have even been called out to shut down churches, schools and public parks and beaches that have been found “in violation” of various lockdown orders.

Now there’s talk of mobilizing the military to deliver forced vaccinations, mass surveillance in order to carry out contact tracing, and heavy fines and jail time for those who dare to venture out without a mask, congregate in worship without the government’s blessing, or re-open their businesses without the government’s say-so.

There are rumblings that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will start thermal screenings to monitor passengers’ temperatures in coming weeks. This is in addition to the virtual strip searches that have become routine aspects of airport security.

Restaurants in parts of the country are being tasked with keeping daily logs of phone numbers, emails, and arrival times for everybody who participates in dine-services, with no mention of how long such records will be kept on file, with whom they will be shared, and under what circumstances.

With the help of Google and Nest cameras, hospitals are morphing into real-time surveillance centers with round-the-clock surveillance cameras monitoring traffic in patients’ rooms. Forget patient privacy, however. Google has a track record of sharing surveillance footage with police.

And then rounding out the power-grabs, the Senate just voted to give police access to web browsing data without a warrant, which would dramatically expand the government’s Patriot Act surveillance powers. The Senate also voted to give Attorney General William Barr the ability to look through the web browsing history of any American — including journalists, politicians, and political rivals — without a warrant, just by saying it is relevant to an investigation. If enacted, privacy experts warn that the new provisions threaten to undermine the free press by potentially preventing the media from exposing abuses of power or acting as a watchdog against political leaders.

If we haven’t already crossed over, we’re skating dangerously close to that line that keeps us on the functioning side of a constitutional republic. It won’t take much to push us over that edge into a full-blown banana republic.

In many ways, this is just more of the same heavy-handed tactics we’ve been seeing in recent years but with one major difference: this COVID-19 state of emergency has invested government officials (and those who view their lives as more valuable than ours) with a sanctimonious, self-righteous, arrogant, Big Brother Knows Best approach to top-down governing, and the fall-out can be seen far and wide.

It’s an ugly, self-serving mindset that views the needs, lives and rights of “we the people” as insignificant when compared to those in power.

That’s how someone who should know better such as Alan Dershowitz, a former Harvard law professor, can suggest that a free people—born in freedom, endowed by their Creator with inalienable rights, and living in a country birthed out of a revolutionary struggle for individual liberty—have no rights to economic freedom, to bodily integrity, or to refuse to comply with a government order with which they disagree.

According to Dershowitz, who has become little more than a legal apologist for the power elite, “You have no right not to be vaccinated, you have no right not to wear a mask, you have no right to open up your business… And if you refuse to be vaccinated, the state has the power to literally take you to a doctor’s office and plunge a needle into your arm.”

Dershowitz is wrong: while the courts may increasingly defer to the government’s brand of Nanny State authoritarianism, we still have rights.

The government may try to abridge those rights, it may refuse to recognize them, it may even attempt to declare martial law and nullify them, but it cannot litigate, legislate or forcefully eradicate them out of existence.

Up to now, we’ve been largely passive participants in this experiment in self-governance. Our inaction and inattention has left us at the mercy of power-hungry politicians, corrupt corporations and brutal, government-funded militias.

Wake up, America.

As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, these ongoing violations of our rights—this attitude by the government that we have no rights—this tyrannical movement that is overtaking our constitutional republic and gaining in momentum and power by the minute—this incessant auction block in which government officials appointed to represent our best interests keep selling us out to the highest bidder—all of these betrayals scream for a response.

To quote the great Rod Serling: “If we don’t listen to that scream—and if we don’t respond to it—we may well wind up sitting amidst our own rubble, looking for the truck that hit us—or the bomb that pulverized us. Get the license number of whatever it was that destroyed the dream. And I think we will find that the vehicle was registered in our own name.”

Throughout the Scriptures, we are warned about apocalyptic events that will precede the second coming of Jesus Christ, and a lot of people are wondering if that period of time is now upon us. All over the Internet, people are engaging in all sorts of speculation and lots of really bizarre theories are being thrown around, and this is causing a great deal of confusion. But all of this confusion is not necessary, because the Bible is actually very clear about what is coming.

Jesus had quite a bit to say about the time just before His return, and He specifically instructed His followers to watch for certain signs. He wanted us to understand that He knew about all of these things in advance, that He has a plan, and that He is in control.

So there is no need to fear. In fact, Jesus told us these things so that we would not be afraid.

Three of the key chapters where Jesus discusses the events of the last days are Matthew 24, Mark 13 and Luke 21. To set the stage for the rest of this article, let me share just three quick verses from Luke 21…

Could it be possible that we have entered a time when these things are starting to be fulfilled?

To answer that question, let’s examine some of the global events that are currently unfolding…

#1 Wars And Rumors Of Wars

War is coming to the Middle East, and it might be coming a lot sooner than most people think.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is very eager to annex portions of Judea and Samaria before the U.S. election in November, and the coalition agreement that he reached with Blue and White chairman Benny Gantz allows him to do that as early as July.

I believe that it will happen at some point in the coming months, and the Palestinians are openly warning that such a move will mean war. In fact, Mahmoud Abbas is so upset about this pending annexation that he just publicly backed out of all previous agreements with the United States and Israel…

In an emergency meeting in Ramallah Tuesday, Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas announced that due to Israeli plans to annex parts of Judea and Samaria, all agreements with Israel and the U.S. are null and void. This would include the Oslo Accords, which was the basis for the establishment of the Palestinian Authority.

And Jordan’s King Abdullah just told a German newspaper that annexation “would lead to a massive conflict with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan”…

In an interview with the German newspaper Der Spiegel, the Jordanian monarch reiterated that a two-state solution was the “only way forward” as a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. “What would happen if the Palestinian National Authority collapsed? There would be more chaos and extremism in the region. If Israel really annexed the West Bank in July, it would lead to a massive conflict with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,” said Abdullah.

This is something to keep a very close eye on, and we also need to keep in mind that a major war between Israel and Iran could erupt at literally any moment as well.

#2 Earthquakes

Our planet continues to become increasing unstable, and my regular readers know that I am particularly concerned about the west coast of the United States. It is just a matter of time before “the Big One” hits California, and this week we did see two very alarming quakes strike just off the California coast…

The first measured at a 4.7 magnitude. It hit at 11:56 p.m. Sunday about 163 miles west of Eureka. The second earthquake was stronger, measuring a 5.5 magnitude hitting in the same area about 160 miles west of Eureka at 12:02 a.m. Monday. The second quake was at the same depth as the first earthquake at about 6 miles down.

Overall, there have been 2,668 earthquakes in California and Nevada over the last 7 days, and that is definitely unusual.

Meanwhile, large earthquakes continue to strike other areas of the globe with frightening regularity. For example, a magnitude 6.2 quake just rocked the Mediterranean Sea, and that made headlines all over the globe.

In the days ahead, the shaking is only going to get worse, but most people don’t understand what is happening.

#3 Volcanoes

I have written about Mt. Popocatepetl near Mexico City many times, and it has roared to life once again.

In fact, it is being reported that it was shooting hot ash 20,000 feet into the air on Wednesday.

Keep a very close eye on this volcano, because someday a catastrophic eruption of Mt. Popocatepetl will result in the worst disaster in the history of Mexico.

Of course Mt. Popocatepetl is far from alone. According to Volcano Discovery, 24 volcanoes around the globe are erupting right now, and dozens more are showing signs of unrest.

#4 Crazy Weather Patterns

You may have noticed that global weather patterns have gone absolutely nuts.

We are seeing record setting droughts in some parts of the world, in other areas we are witnessing unprecedented flooding, and global food production has been greatly disrupted by one unforeseen event after another.

For instance, this week India and Bangladesh are preparing for Super Cyclone Amphan to make landfall. On Monday night, that storm “officially became the strongest storm ever recorded in the Bay of Bengal”…

Millions of people in India and Bangladesh are bracing for what is now being called the strongest storm ever recorded in the Bay of Bengal. Super Cyclone Amphan is anticipated to make landfall in less than 36 hours, bringing destructive winds and heavy rain to a region already struggling with the coronavirus pandemic. According to CNN, Super Cyclone Amphan officially became the strongest storm ever recorded in the Bay of Bengal on Monday night, after intensifying with sustained wind speeds of up to 165 miles per hour. Even though Amphan has weakened slightly the storm is still the equivalent of a Category 3 Atlantic hurricane, with winds speeds up to 115 mph.

#5 Armies Of Locusts

Billions of locusts have been traveling in giant swarms the size of major cities across large portions of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. These mammoth swarms can travel up to 90 miles a day, and when they descend on a farm they can eat all of the vegetation in as little as 30 seconds.

I have written about these enormous locust armies numerous times, and they keep making headlines all over the world. This week, video of these locusts “blocking out the sun in Iran” was being widely shared on social media…

Terrifying footage of an apocalyptic swarm of locusts blocking out the sun in Iran has emerged after it was revealed the military could be called to fight a plague that may destroy at least $7billion (£5.7bn) worth of crops. The chilling video shows a haze formed of millions of the bugs covering the horizon on a motorway in the south of the country.

#6 African Swine Fever

Before COVID-19 came along, African Swine Fever was the most serious pestilence affecting the planet.

There is no vaccine, there is no cure, and it is killing pigs all over the globe at a staggering rate.

In fact, approximately half the pigs in China and approximately one-fourth of all the pigs in the entire world have already been wiped out by this disease.

Needless to say, this is having a tremendous impact on the global food supply, because much of the world relies on pig meat as a primary source of protein.

#7 Famines And Food Riots

You know that things are bad when even the United Nations is using the word “biblical” to describe the famines that are beginning to emerge around the globe.

The head of the UN World Food Program, David Beasley, is publicly warning that we are heading into “the worst humanitarian crisis since World War Two”, and he is telling us that we could soon see approximately 300,000 people literally starve to death every single day…

“If we can’t reach these people with the life-saving assistance they need, our analysis shows that 300,000 people could starve to death every single day over a three-month period”, he upheld. “This does not include the increase of starvation due to COVID-19”.

We have already witnessed very large food riots in Africa, and now they are starting to happen in South America.

For example, check out what just happened in the capital of Chile…

The coronavirus hit Chile at a particularly delicate time. Back in October, the Chilean military deployed tanks and troops onto the streets of Santiago – the Chilean capital – and President Sebastian Pinera declaring a state of emergency to quell a violent uprising triggered by – of all things – a hike in metro fares (can you imagine that happening in NYC?). Now, some of the nation’s poorest are rising up against the government again in a violent protest movement over the lack of government assistance. Specifically, food shortages have left thousands of Chileans with nothing to eat, and the mandatory closures have made it impossible for them to work or buy food.

Global food supplies have gotten very tight, and they are only going to get tighter in the months ahead.

#8 Economic Collapse

Countries all over the world have locked down their economies in 2020 due to fear of COVID-19, and that has plunged the entire global economy into a deep depression.

Here in the United States, more than 36 million Americans have already lost their jobs, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago says that the real rate of unemployment in the United States is now 30.7 percent, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is projecting that U.S. GDP will fall by 42.8 percent during the second quarter of this year.

Now that our economic bubble has burst, the dominoes are just going to continue to tumble, and the days ahead are looking quite bleak.

#9 The Coronavirus Plague

This is the greatest public health crisis in a hundred years, and it looks like this pandemic is going to be with us for many months to come.

Already, there have been more than 5 million confirmed cases around the world and more than 300,000 people have died. Many had been hoping that the worst was behind us, but the head of the WHO just told us that Tuesday was the worst day for new cases “since the outbreak began”…

“We still have a long way to go in this pandemic,” Tedros said at a briefing in Geneva. “In the last 24 hours, there have been 106,000 cases reported to WHO – the most in a single day since the outbreak began. Almost two-thirds of these cases were reported in just four countries.”

Jesus specifically warned us that there would be “pestilences” during the time before His return, and I believe in the future we will see even worse pandemics than this one.

In fact, many of the signs that I discussed above will get worse in the days ahead. Just as birth pains increase in frequency and severity as the time for birth gets closer, we should expect many of the signs that Jesus warned about to increase in frequency and severity as well.

But even in the midst of all the chaos that is coming, God will be moving, and I believe that the greatest revival in all of human history is still ahead of us.

12,https://dcdirtylaundry.com/arkansas-almost-600-workers-test-positive-for-covid-19-at-another-tyson-plant/,DC Dirty Laundry,2020-05-21,['Dino Porrazzo'],Arkansas: Almost 600 Workers Test Positive For Covid-19 At Another Tyson Plant,https://dcdirtylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tyson.jpg,"SPRINGDALE, Ark. – (RELEASE) – Tyson Foods, Inc. announced today the results of facility-wide testing for COVID-19 at its Wilkesboro, North Carolina poultry facility.

Of the 2,244 team members and contractors who work at the facility and were tested, 570 tested positive, the majority of whom did not show any symptoms and otherwise would not have been identified. The total comprises 237 individuals who were tested by the Department of Health or when seeking care through their own health care providers and an additional 2,007 individuals who were tested onsite from May 6 to May 9. Team members who test positive receive paid leave and may return to work only when they have met the criteria established by both the CDC and Tyson.

The Wilkesboro facility is among an initial group of more than 30 production facilities in the United States where Tyson is rolling out advanced testing capabilities and enhanced care options on-site to team members in partnership with MATRIX MEDICAL, a leading medical clinical services company, and other partners. The company is prioritizing communities with a higher prevalence of COVID-19 and will assess additional needs based on significant risk factors and access to testing.

As it is doing at the Wilkesboro facility, Tyson will disclose verified test results at other plants to health and government officials, team members and stakeholders as part of its efforts to help affected communities where it operates better understand the coronavirus and the protective measures that can be taken to help prevent its spread.

“We are working closely with local health departments to protect our team members and their families, and to help manage the spread of the virus in our communities,” said Tom Brower, Senior Vice President of Health and Safety for Tyson Foods. “We are using the most up-to-date data and resources to support our team members, and we are committed to ensuring they feel safe and secure when they come to work.”

Team members at Tyson’s Wilkesboro facility have access to daily clinical symptom screenings, nurse practitioners and enhanced education. AXIOM MEDICAL, a health care case management provider, will also track the symptoms of team members who test positive and provide additional care. Production has begun to ramp up at the facility, where operations were limited on May 14 to carry out additional deep cleaning.

Tyson has also put in place a host of protective steps that meet or exceed CDC and OSHA guidance for preventing COVID-19. These include symptom screenings for all team members before every shift, providing mandatory protective face masks to all team members, as well as a range of social distancing measures including physical barriers between workstations and in break rooms.

“Our team members are essential to helping to feed the nation, and their health and safety is always our first priority,” said Kevin Taylor, Complex Manager for Wilkesboro facility. “Disclosing our testing results will help better protect our team members and help provide the wider Wilkesboro community with the information it needs to stop the spread of the virus.”

Tyson Foods has increased short-term disability coverage to 90% of normal pay until June 30 to encourage team members to stay home when they are sick. The company also has doubled its “thank you” bonus for its frontline workers. Team members who cannot come to work because of illness or childcare issues related to COVID-19 will continue to qualify.

Based on the $3 trillion HEROES Act that House Democrats have just unveiled, the answer is illegal aliens and criminals.

While the HEROES Act pretends to be about coronavirus relief, its focus is on immigration.

With over 20 million jobs lost in April, the HEROES Act goes to great lengths to make sure that millions of illegal aliens will still be able to keep their jobs, no matter how many Americans lose theirs.

Buried under the misleadingly titled, “Protections for Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers”, is a virtual blank check to keep illegal aliens from being deported. The HEROES Act’s definition of “critical infrastructure workers” covers cafeteria workers, warehouse janitors, and pet food delivery boys.

Anyone who works in virtually any field involving food in any way is a “critical infrastructure worker”. An illegal alien putting out mouse traps at any facility involving food from “wholesale to retail” is a critical worker. A vast array of call center workers and delivery people are covered. Even laundromat employees are critical infrastructure workers under the federal definition used by the HEROES Act.

The HEROES Act doesn’t just protect illegal aliens from deportation, but SEC. 191203 declares that “hiring” illegal aliens is not a violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act and that the aliens are “deemed to be in a period of deferred action and authorized for employment.”

Americans seeking jobs as essential workers will be forced to compete with newly legalized illegal aliens.

Even while tens of millions of Americans are out of work, Pelosi and the House Democrats are going to great lengths to protect the ability of employers to illegally hire illegal aliens while authorizing them to accept those jobs. And considering how Federal judges have defended DACA’s deferred action, this temporary deferral could effectively become a permanent amnesty for millions of illegals.

The HEROES Act is really a backdoor amnesty that will declare illegal aliens “heroes” for delivering pizza. And these heroes who delivered pizza and sprayed for roaches in a plant somewhere can’t be deported. Instead, they’re going to be honored and legalized while Americans lose their jobs, savings, and lives.

The HEROES Act may end up killing more Americans of employment age than the coronavirus will.

Pelosi’s boondoggle also extends visas for aliens already in this country, regardless of whether they’re “critical” workers or not, and ‘rolls over’ all the visas that weren’t issued during this time. The Democrats are determined not to miss a single chance to bring more of their voters into the United States.

The rollover provisions focus on chain migration via “family-sponsored immigrants”, “employment-based immigrants” and “diversity immigrants”. All of these are aspects of a broken immigration system.

SEC. 191204 or “Supplementing the COVID Response Workforce” expedites processing applications for aliens who “provide healthcare” within 30 days by email. Visa applications can be bypassed with video-conferencing, and interviews are waived. This could allow for bringing Syrian Islamic “health care workers” to this country with virtually no oversight or screening even though the shortage of personnel that is driving this strategy has never actually come into being and American workers are being furloughed at hospitals and medical centers that were prevented from performing most procedures.

American health care workers furloughed because of the lockdown may end up losing their jobs because the Democrats who praise them as “heroes” insist on bringing in foreign workers to take their place.

And these foreign health care workers are being brought in under the broad umbrella of “preventing COVID-19”. If we didn’t have open borders on the ground and in the air, there wouldn’t have been a Wuhan Virus to prevent. But even while claiming to fight a pandemic caused by a foreign virus, Pelosi and the Democrats want more immigration and more open borders to spread more pandemics.

SEC. 191205 seeks to free illegal aliens already in ICE custody with a review of “the immigration files of all individuals in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to assess the need for continued detention” to free those who are “not subject to mandatory detention laws.”

The section also demands that illegal aliens get free video chats, email access, and orders that pro-illegal alien lefty groups be given “broad and flexible access” to illegals.

But the HEROES Act doesn’t just settle for freeing illegal aliens, not when it can also free criminals.

The Dem bill seeks to free “vulnerable and low-risk individuals” in pre-trial detention. The definition of “vulnerable” is any prisoner over who is over 50 or under 18 who has, sickle-cell anemia, or asthma.

And how do Pelosi and her ilk define “low-risk”?

Any criminal who “does not pose a risk of serious, imminent injury to a reasonably identifiable person”.

That covers criminals who pose a risk of serious, imminent injury to any random member of the public.

Criminals who pose a risk of serious, but not imminent injury, criminals who pose a risk of imminent, but not serious injury, and criminals who pose a serious, imminent risk of injury to someone who can’t be reasonably identified, could all be considered “low-risk” by the jailbreaking HEROES Act.

Under these parameters, an asthmatic serial killer ought to be considered low-risk because we can’t identify whom he might chop to bits. A paranoid schizophrenic who only seriously assaults people when he goes off his medication could be considered to pose a risk of serious, but not imminent injury.

And, of course, muggers who don’t seriously hurt their victims would be considered low-risk. Ditto for car thieves, burglars, assorted robbers, and any felon who isn’t walking around with a sign reading, “I will kill Andrew next Tuesday”. And even then, we might not be “reasonably” sure which Andrew he means.

These are the heroes of Pelosi’s HEROES Act.

There’s also money for “safe and sanitary temporary transitional housing” and facilitating “family reunification” for the released criminals. And a push for applying “all pre- and post-adjudication release processes and mechanisms applicable to juveniles… as quickly as possible”.

That would cover 17-year-old offenders.

Pelosi and her Democrat allies claim to be very concerned about inmates in custody contracting the coronavirus. And yet after months of this, the predicted mass death tolls in prisons haven’t happened. Instead the elderly have been dying in large numbers in nursing homes. If the Democrats were really concerned, they would cut off funding to any municipality arresting people over social distancing.

But the Dems seem happy with a state of affairs in which citizens are arrested and criminals are freed.

The HEROES Act contains plenty that is bad, including a waiver of the Buy American Act that is a free gift to the People’s Republic of China, but its obsession with criminals and illegal aliens, at the expense of Americans, shows who Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats think that they’re really in office to serve.

While Americans are put out of work, the Democrats help illegal aliens hang on to their jobs. And while Americans are locked up for trying to cut hair, go for a walk, or play catch, criminals are set free.

The Democrat coronatopia is a place where criminals are free and everyone else is in prison, and where only government officials and illegal aliens have jobs.

But what if we told you that the true intent behind mass testing is to steal people’s DNA and store it away in government databases?

It might sound like some kind of crazy sci-fi flick, but hear us out. Back in late April when New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was asked about what happens after a person is tested for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), and whether the results “automatically go into some kind of database,” this was Cuomo’s chilling response:

“Yes, your result will be logged into both a state and county database through an electronic lab reporting system. The database includes your name.”

When further pressed about what a positive test result entails from the government’s standpoint, Cuomo explained that all newly infected are being ordered by their county health departments to quarantine for 14 days from the time of their most recent symptoms. They are also being asked to procure the names of anyone they may have come into contact with so that they, too, can be told to quarantine.

This directly ties into the contact tracing push from people like Bill and Hillary Clinton, who want an “army of contact tracers” to sweep the nation and hunt down anyone who might have been infected with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

Be sure to listen to the following episode of The Health Ranger Report in which Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks to Dr. Judy Mikovits about these and other authoritarian measures being thrown at the people in response to this “plandemic:”

WHO official: A vaccine for coronavirus may never arrive

In addition to the typical swabbing protocol, another form of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) testing apparently involves taking blood samples by pricking people’s fingers, which the federal government is now implementing at pharmacies across America.

This combination of collecting both saliva and blood would seem to suggest that dark forces are perhaps trying to profile people’s genomes for some other purpose besides keeping them “safe” from a virus.

Keep in mind that there may never even be a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), at least according to Dr. David Nabarro from the WHO, a professor of global health at Imperial College London.

As it turns out, it is quite difficult to produce an effective vaccine for a virus, let alone one that continues to mutate and basically become new viruses. If a vaccine is, in fact, released, chances are it will not be effective nor will it be safe.

“There are some viruses that we still do not have vaccines against,” Nabarro is quoted as saying. “We can’t make an absolute assumption that a vaccine will appear at all, or if it does appear, whether it will pass all the tests of efficacy and safety.”

Without a vaccine, experts are automatically predicting that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) will never go away and instead become an annual event. And they are saying this while completely ignoring nutrition, supplementation, and other lifestyle changes that could easily protect the masses at a minimal cost.

“It’s absolutely essential that all societies everywhere get themselves into a position where they are able to defend against the coronavirus as a constant threat, and to be able to go about social life and economic activity with the virus in our midst,” Nabarro says.
