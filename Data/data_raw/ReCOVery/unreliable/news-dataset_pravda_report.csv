The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for the Republic of Ingushetia is looking into the appeal submitted from the Legal Initiative project with a request to investigate into the case of female circumcision, when a nine-year-old girl was circumcised at a local private clinic.

Doctors, medical personnel and administration of “Aybolit” clinic can be prosecuted for causing harm to health, committing sexual acts and providing unsafe services with a view to receive financial profit.

The victim’s mother said that she had separated from the child’s father a long time ago and kept the children. On June 21, 2019, the woman’s ex-spouse took his son and daughter to his house for the weekend. The next day, the boy called his mother and said that his sister returned home in blood and tearful. It turned out that the girl’s stepmother, her father’s second wife, took the little girl to Aybolit clinic in the city of Magas. Children's gynecologist Izanya Nalgieva conducted the circumcision procedure against the girl’s will. The girl’s grandmother said with reference to what her granddaughter told her, that the child was screaming and trying to break free, but her stepmother and clinic employee were holding her arms and legs. The adults were telling her that it was a common procedure for every girl, that she was not going to die.

There was no legal representative with the child at the moment of surgery. No one signed the consent for the surgery either. The doctor had no right to touch the patient.

On June 27, 2019, the girl’s mother went to the Investigative Committee Directorate for Chechnya (at her place of residence). A criminal case was filed against the children’s gynecologist under Part 1 of Art. 115 of the Criminal Code (intentional infliction of insignificant bodily harm, which caused a short-term health disorder or an insignificant loss of general earning capacity).

The gynecologist, a week after the incident, admitted the case of circumcision. However, an extract from the interrogation protocol states that ""the child’s parents agreed to skin incision in the area of the clitoris, after which the procedure was performed.""

A forensic medical examination established that the girl had “a 6x5 millimeter cut wound on her external genitalia.”

Later, during an interrogation, children's gynecologist Nalgieva stated that she simply provided the girl with medical care and did not perform any surgery. ""I read my protocol inattentively and erroneously indicated that the ritual of circumcision was performed. At that time I did not have all that information memorized, because I did not have the health record available to me,” explained Nalgieva.

A representative of the clinic, Beslan Matiev, denied all the charges and said that the girl’s family simply wanted to make money on the reputation of the clinic. When the affected party produced the price list of the clinic, where circumcision was listed in the “gynecology” section with a price of 2,000 rubles, Matiev said that the price list had been “corrected” because the clinic had no position for female circumcisions.

Ingushetia’s Commissioner for Human Rights, Dzhambulat Ozdoev, stated that he was ready to consider the statement from the girl’s family. “Of course, something needs to be done. So far we only have information from the Internet – this is the only case of the procedure,” the official said.

The trial of children’s gynecologist Nalgieva began in late 2019 and was the first incident in the Russian judicial system, when a case of female genital mutilation was considered in court. The trial is still pending. The judge repeatedly proposed reconciliation of the parties, but it did not take place, and the court hearings continued until the introduction of restrictive measures in connection with the coronavirus pandemic. The trial is to resume after the lockdown measures are lifted.

Representatives of the Ministry of Health of Ingushetia later announced that such surgeries are not conducted in public medical organizations of the republic, while the ministry does not regulate the activities of private clinics.

According to international standards, female genital mutilation may lead to extremely negative consequences for women's reproductive, psychological and sexual health. The UN and the WHO repeatedly called female genital mutilation a violation of the right to health and freedom from torture.

The European Court of Human Rights recognizes female genital mutilation as torture that violates Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

The Russian Council of Muftis, in turn, explained that female circumcision was alien to Islam, that it was a ""pre-Islamic tradition"", while subduing the lust of the flesh was a matter of moral guidelines of a person.",7.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

Tenants of a dormitory on 11 Cheredovaya Street in the city of Omsk were locked in the building. All the tenants of the building are not allowed to go outside. Earlier, several cases of the coronavirus infection were registered among those living in the dormitory, and all 500 tenants found themselves under the conditions of strict quarantine.

Police officers were put on guard at the entrances – the citizens supposedly do not follow the rules of the self-isolation mode. However, the officers have not been able to show the decree on quarantine restrictions to the tenants because they do not have the document themselves.

All the tenants of the dormitory are thus prohibited from going outside: the people are not allowed to go out to buy groceries, medications or other essential drugs. Most of them survive with the help of their relatives and friends, who bring them food.

Those who do not have anyone to help them, were forced to go from door to door asking for bread.

Someone reportedly tried to go out to buy groceries through the back door, but the door was soon blocked. Someone else, as it was reported, jumped out of the window on the second storey to be able to go to buy groceries.

In Dagestan, more than 40 doctors died from community-acquired pneumonia and coronavirus infection, the head of the Republican Ministry of Health, Jamaludin Hajiyibragimov said.

When asked why the names of the dead doctors were not published on the official website of the Ministry of Health, the official replied that he did not separate his colleagues from other victims of the coronavirus infection in the republic.

According to the official, more than 13,000 people suffer from pneumonia and COVID-19 in Dagestan. As many as 7,000 of those people are hospitalized.

As the minister specified, on May 16, 29 people died from COVID-19 in Dagestan, while 657 people died from community-acquired pneumonia.

Hajiyibragimov also said that families of medical employees, who died on duty, would receive a financial compensation in the amount of 2.7 million rubles, while hospital personnel, whose health deteriorated as a result of their work, would receive compensations from 688,000 to 2 million rubles.

Most recent coronavirus stats for Russia are as follows:

the total number of cases is 272 043 people

2537 died from the disease

63 166 recovered.

Meanwhile, former mixed martial athlete (MMA), Magomedkhan Gamzatkhanov spoke about the situation with the spread of the coronavirus infection in Dagestan. According to the former athlete, the authorities of the republic could not convince the people of the dangers of COVID-19.

“We have a catastrophic situation ÑÑÐºÑ in Dagestan. Ninety people were taken to the central hospital yesterday. A lot of people die. It has become better now, but a lot of people are still sick,” Gamzatkhanov, one of the pioneers of MMA in Russia told Sport Express.

Gamzatkhanov believes that the coronavirus hit Dagestan so hard because the region is being governed from Moscow, rather than locally.

""To understand what a Dagestani is, one needs to be one. The governor of the Tula region says that one needs to stay home, and everyone does. In Dagestan, the situation is different. People don’t believe the local authorities. A lot of people bought into those rumors from social networks that said that the disease was not dangerous. People continued going to wedding parties, to other events, infecting everyone around. Now they have realized how serious the crisis has become for them. They stay home, and the situation is improving,” Gamzatkhanov said.



In Dagestan, there are 3,280 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. Officially, 29 people died from the novel virus in the republic; from community-acquired pneumonia - 657 people. In addition, more than 40 doctors have died in Dagestan.

According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, such a large number of positive cases and deaths in the republic of Dagestan have appeared due to self-treatment attempts. In addition, people ask for medical help too late.",7.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

Officials representing the Moscow Department of Health deny that Russia’s official COVID-19 statistics underestimate the number of coronavirus-caused deaths in the country. Such information earlier appeared in a number of publications that analyzed open data on monthly mortality rates.

According to officials of the Moscow Department of Health, 11,846 deaths were registered in the Russian capital in April 2020, which was 1,841 deaths more than was recorded in April 2019. Journalists concluded that 1,800 deaths might not have been accounted for as coronavirus-caused deaths. ""A comparison of mortality rates from the point of view of monthly dynamics is incorrect and does not serve as clear evidence of any trends,"" department officials said.

The ministry emphasized that in Russia and Moscow, unlike in many other countries, autopsies of bodies of deceased persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are performed in 100% of cases. Therefore, posthumous diagnoses and causes of death are ultimately ""highly accurate."" Thus, according to the department, coronavirus and its complications, most often pneumonia, have claimed the lives of 639 people from the total number of deaths reported in April.

""It is impossible to establish the cause of death as COVID-19 in other cases. For example, over 60% of deaths were caused by obviously alternative reasons, such as vascular diseases (myocardial infarction and stroke), stage 4 malignant diseases (essentially palliative patients), leukemia, ""systemic diseases with the development of organ failure (for example, amyloidosis and terminal renal failure) and other incurable fatal diseases,"" a message posted on the website of the department said.

The department also noted that any seasonal increase in the incidence of ARVI (acute respiratory viral infection) leads to an increase in mortality, let alone the coronavirus pandemic.

""In these cases, the infectious onset acts as a catalyst for the rapid progression of chronic diseases and for the manifestation of new diseases,"" representatives of the department said.

Even if all the additional mortality rate for April in Moscow is attributed to coronavirus, the mortality from COVID-19 will be “slightly more than three percent, which is lower than the official mortality rates in New York and London (10 and 23 percent respectively),” the department concluded.

Earlier, Russia’s Ministry of Health and Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova, commenting on an article by The Financial Times, which said that the coronavirus mortality rate in Russia could be 70 percent higher than official statistics, expressed a similar point of view.

The Ministry of Health said that health workers are guided by the rules of the ""International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health Related Problems, 10th Revision.” In cases of the coronavirus infection, “International Guidelines for Certification and Classification (Coding) of COVID-19 as Cause of Death” are used.

The documents are designed to encode COVID-19 as the main cause of death in almost all cases, when a COVID-positive patient dies despite other illnesses that he or she may have had.

“A death due to COVID-19 is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery from COVID-19 between illness and death. A death due toCOVID-19 may not be attributed to another disease (e.g. cancer) and should be counted independently of preexisting conditions that are suspected of triggering a severe course of COVID-19,” the document published on the website of the World Health Organization says.

However, the current version of temporary recommendations from the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation titled “Prevention, Diagnosis and Treatment of the New Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19),” which Russian doctors use as guidelines, say that when formulating a pathoanatomical diagnosis, one should differentiate between deaths caused by COVID-19 as the main disease and deaths against the background of the coronavirus infection, ""but without its clinical and morphological manifestations that could become the cause of death."" Therefore, a significant part of those who died having COVID-19 in Russia may not be included in the stats as those who died from coronavirus.",7.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

Dmitry Peskov, official spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was hospitalized with confirmed Covid-19 infection on May 12, has developed bilateral pneumonia. In an interview with the Kommersant publication, Peskov said employees of the presidential administration get tested for the coronavirus infection on a daily basis.

""I had a feeling that I keep it under control. Then, unfortunately, one of my colleagues, with whom I earlier spoke, fell ill and I had to go into self-isolation mode after May 1,” the Kremlin representative said.

Peskov continued getting tested, and one of the tests was confirmed positive. According to Peskov, he had no symptoms on the first day, but then ""unpleasant"" body temperature rose to over 37 degrees and he developed bodily pains.

Peskov’s wife, former Olympic champion in figure skating Tatyana Navka, had the same symptoms, but her body temperature was “higher”. For a couple of days the spouses stayed home, but when they realized that the process “was going uphill, so to speak,"" they went to the hospital for CT scanning procedure.

Peskov noted that it is important to catch the moment. ""The main thing about this disease is not to miss it. This is an absolutely bloodthirsty virus. Although, thank God, doctors already have experience in combating it, but still the share of unpredictability associated with individual peculiarities is always present,"" he stated.

The peculiarity of COVID-19, according to Peskov, is that it is not the virus that starts “eating” the lungs, but the body itself. ""That is, a hormonal storm begins, and the immune system tries to defeat this virus. Together with the virus, the body starts to devour the lungs. This is where the frosted glass effect comes from. This may lead to pulmonary thrombosis. Well, it depends,” Dmitry Peskov said.

Bloodthirsty virus to live with forever

Answering a question about contacts with the president, Peskov noted that he had not contacted Putin in person for more than a month. ""There is no need for that, as my work is arranged differently,"" he explained, adding that video conferencing can take place both in open and closed mode, while modern technologies make it possible to ensure secrecy.

Peskov also said that his family took all precautions and stayed home for 1.5 months carefully, although they failed to avoid the infection.

“The virus is very dangerous indeed, it is easily transmitted from person to person easily, and it is very difficult to have guaranteed protection from it. The only way, and this should be understood by those who have underlying conditions in the form of chronic diseases, who belong to the older age group, - one has to stay home, avoid contact with the outside world,"" Putin’s spokesman said.

According to Peskov, mankind will always have to live with various coronaviruses: ""These are living organisms, they are fighting for a place for life on Earth."" Now one needs to wait for the vaccine, which experts, according to Peskov, inject themselves during clinical trials. ""We will not name the institution, the people, but those people who are die-hard fans of their work in the best sense of the word,"" he said.",7.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

One is not allowed to visit cemeteries due to the coronavirus pandemic.

It is forbidden to deliver deceased bodies with confirmed COVID-19 to relatives for farewell ceremony. In accordance with recommendations from the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, the burial of those who dies of the coronavirus infection shall be carried out in closed coffins, and it is strictly forbidden to open them during the funeral.

Different regions of Russia practice different norms for the burial of coronavirus victims' bodies. In some regions, it is recommended to bury the deceased in closed coffins, in some others the authorities insist on zinc coffins or cremation, although cremation is not mandatory.

It is recommended to observe safety measures at all funerals, and direct tactile contacts with the body or the coffin of the deceased are prohibited. One is required to maintain social distancing and use personal protective equipment, like in any other public place. Employees of cemeteries, funeral agencies and funeral homes use special protective suits along with face masks and gloves.

Specially designated cemeteries provided for victims of Covid-19

Some regions of the Russian Federation have established regulations for funeral procedures against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic. Restrictions on the number of individuals who come to bid farewell at a funeral ceremony depend on the decision of the local authorities. For example, in North Ossetia, the presence of more than 50 people at a funeral is prohibited. In Moscow and the Moscow region, it is recommended to limit the number of people at funeral to 5-7 people maximum. In some parts of the country, those who died of coronavirus are buried at ordinary cemeteries, whereas in other regions, it is allowed to use only specially designated cemeteries. For example, in St. Petersburg, Mordovia and some other regions, special cemeteries and territories were assigned for victims of COVID-19.

Performing the autopsy of the body of the deceased is mandatory, and it is impossible to refuse from it, even if the deceased did not have the confirmed infection, but was only suspected for it.

The deceased bodies with the confirmed coronavirus are treated with a disinfectant. Afterwards, they are packed into double sealed bags, which are no longer allowed to open. Ordinary coffins are used – they can be treated with a disinfectant both on the outside and on the inside. At some cemeteries, coffins are sprinkled with bleach on the inside.

There are some funeral firms that started providing remote services, such as remote funerals, remote visiting of burial sites, remote flower laying, remote grave cleaning, etc.

Death certificates may not always indicate that the deceased was COVID-positive. The cause of death may be stated as cancer, heart failure, autoimmune diseases or other chronic diseases, which, in combination with COVID-19, have led to death.

All the killed patients were connected to ventilators. Four of them died as a result of carbon monoxide exposure, another one died when the ventilator, to which the patient was connected, was turned off. According to preliminary reports, the fire started due to the hazardous overload of the ventilator.

In total, as many as 150 people were evacuated from the building; the fire was localized. All the patients and personnel, who were staying in the intensive care unit during the fire, were transferred to the first floor of the hospital.

Of these, 11,231 were detected in the last 24 hours.

More than half of those infected are still in Moscow.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin says:

""The fact that we have identified so many infected people is a huge plus, but not a minus, because it means that infected people are quarantined in a timely manner, and the spread of the virus is slowing down.""

Another “plus” in comparison with other countries is the relatively low mortality rate among coronavirus patients:

1,625 people have died in the country during the epidemic (as of May 8, 2020)

On May 6, it was reported that Olga Lyubimova, Russia’s Minister of Culture, became infected with the coronavirus. The minister is going through the mild course of the disease, so there is no need to hospitalize her yet. Olga Lyubimova has thus become a third member of the Russian government, who was infected with COVID-19.

On April 30, it was reported that the Prime Minister of Russia Mikhail Mishustin was infected with coronavirus. Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov has been appointed acting head of government.

Meanwhile, Russia will have to experience a new surge in the incidence of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, Ivan Konovalov, assistant professor of infectious diseases in children at the Russian National Medical University named after Pirogov said.

According to the professor, Russia will see a sharp growth of infections in one or two weeks because most Russians violate self-isolation regime during May holidays. “No plateau is yet in sight as it requires no growth trend for several consecutive weeks,” the specialist said.

US officials persistently accuse China of concealing the true extent of the outbreak of coronavirus disease to stock up on medical supplies. According to the USA, there is sufficient evidence to indicate that COVID-19 began to spread worldwide from a laboratory in Wuhan.

Supposedly, Beijing did not inform the WHO of the degree of contagiousness of the infection and hid data on an increase in imports of medical goods (face masks, surgical gowns, gloves, etc) and a decrease in their exports.

US President Donald Trump says that the Chinese authorities made a huge mistake at the early stage of the fight against the spread of coronavirus and misled the international community in trying to hide the infection.

China believes USA is hiding the truth

The Chinese authorities reject all allegations claiming that China, from the very beginning of the epidemic, took an open and responsible position in informing the world community about the spread of the infection. The PRC also refers to numerous scientific confirmations and the WHO that say that the virus could not be created artificially.

In this regard, the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, People's Daily, has formulated ten questions, which the world wants the United States to answer.

According to the publication, it has been more than 100 days since the discovery of the first case of COVID-19 in the United States. Since January 20, the number of confirmed cases in the United States has exceeded one million, which made the USA the leader in the number of confirmed cases and deaths.

As long as the epidemiological situation continues to worsen, US politicians spread false information and blame others, the People’s Daily says.

Such a position, the newspaper says, gives US officials an opportunity shift responsibility. In addition, it reveals dubious moments in the prevention and control of the epidemic in the United States.

Ramzan Kadyrov, the President of Chechnya, who, according to unconfirmed reports, was hospitalized after he had his lungs deteriorated as a result of the coronavirus infection, is in serious condition.

According to unnamed sources, doctors believe that Kadyrov contracted the coronavirus infection about two or three weeks ago. A week after, his health condition deteriorated, although he believed that it was common cold. Soon afterwards, he was hospitalized to one of the best clinics in Moscow. Reports about his hospitalization appeared on May 21, although representatives of the Chechen administration have not released any official comments on the subject.

Reportedly, Kadyrov started complaining of first symptoms a few days ago, but attributed his ailment to a common respiratory infection. His condition began to deteriorate rapidly, and Chechen doctors advised he should contact Moscow hospitals.



Until recently, Ramzan Kadyrov, led a normal life and did not follow any precautions recommended in connection with the rapid spread of coronavirus. He was holding daily meetings with members of his administration and traveling around the republic. It was reported that he went to a remote area of the republic to release nursery-grown mountain goats into the wild.



At the same time, Chechnya implemented strict quarantine measures in mid-April. Free movement was permitted only for medical personnel, employees of road, communal and emergency services, as well as for those who have special passes.



The president of Chechnya offered to send those who violate lockdown measures to agricultural works. ""He didn't want to stay home so he went outside? Well, let him work all day in the field and bring good. We will find work for him. Let him plow the fields, sow and grow,"" said Ramzan Kadyrov.



On April 29, Kadyrov ordered to tighten control over the movement of people. Quarantine violators will be deprived of their vehicles and forced to clean the streets, he said. Local residents criticized the tight control of security officials over those who go outside.

Russia is going to see four scenarios with the development of the coronavirus pandemic. The most probable one of them is described as push-and-pull: repeated waves of morbidity and a string of quarantines until 2021.

Experts at the international consulting company Boston Consulting Group (BCG) believe that according to one of the four scenarios, the virus would be stopped, and the crisis would be limited to only one wave. In this case, the country will lose 4-6% of GDP. Non-food retail businesses and services would be suspended as a result of the lockdown, which may last for about two months in each region. Businesses will recover quickly after the lockdown ends. However, many small businesses will close, which will increase the level of unemployment.

Under the critical recession scenario, Russia will lose 10-15% of GDP. The virus crisis will last longer, and the country will see stringent quarantine measures. Industrial production and construction will stop, which will lead to a decrease in demand for resources, primarily hydrocarbons and steel. A large-scale liquidity crisis will begin throughout the Russian economy, which will put an excessive burden on the banking system.

Another scenario would be similar to the period, in which Russia found herself in the early 1990s after the collapse of the USSR. In this scenario, the world will see long-term recession in global economy, but BCG experts do not see any prerequisites for it.

In the most plausible scenario of quarantine cycles, Russia's GDP will decline by 7-10% compared to 5%, which the Central Bank and Finance Minister Anton Siluanov predicted. Bursts of morbidity are possible before the end of 2021, because the coronavirus vaccine will be released no earlier than in late 2020.

A long lockdown will lead to numerous bankruptcies in small and medium-sized businesses. In this scenario, the government will be opening and closing the economy depending on the incidence rate. Long-term lockdown will lead to further decline in the sector of services and retail, a drop in demand for real estate and a decrease in production and wholesale trade.

Experts recommend the Russian authorities expand the capacity of medical institutions after quarantine ends, make quarantine more predictable and shorter, and use decisive measures to support the economy during lockdown. If quarantines are short enough (less than 25% of the total pandemic period), it would be cheaper for the state to subsidize wages during this period rather than to support a sharply increased number of unemployed people.",7.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

Employees of the National Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology named after N. F. Gamalei of the Ministry of Health of Russia tested their vector vaccine against COVID-19. The experiment was successful: immunity was confirmed, no negative effects were found, Alexander Gunzburg, the director of the center said.

""As for the developers, they tested it on themselves to protect themselves in the first place, so that they could continue developing the vaccine during the pandemic. Everyone involved in the development are protected accordingly,"" said Alexander Gunzburg.

Answering the question of whether there were any side effects, the academician replied:

""No. Everyone is alive, healthy and happy.""

He did not specify the number of colleagues who tested the vaccine on themselves, although, according to him, it goes about a wide circle of employees of the center - developers, organizers of preclinical studies and technologists.



The vaccine that the research center is developing is a promising vector vaccine based on the DNA of the adenovirus, in which the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus gene was integrated. The adenovirus is used as a ""container"" to deliver the coronavirus gene to cells, launch the synthesis of the coat proteins of the new coronavirus (the 'corona,' which earned the coronavirus its name) and thereby ""introduce"" the immune system to the potential enemy. Vaccines of this type are known as vector vaccines.



In mid-May, Alexander Gunzburg said that the vaccine was successfully tested on small animals - mice and guinea pigs. He also said that if the trials on primates, and then on volunteers, end successfully, the production of the vaccine against coronavirus in Russia may begin in August. However, it will be impossible to provide the vaccine to all citizens of the Russian Federation, the academician said. The vaccine will be delivered to doctors, law enforcement officers and social workers in the first place.

Meanwhile, the head of Rospotrebnadzor Anna Popova reported an increase in the number of Russians, in whom the coronavirus infection is asymptomatic - up to 30% against 10% in March.

The coronavirus infection in Russia continues spreading at a dangerous pace. There is no more optimistic scenario for the development of the crisis: the number of positive cases and deaths will continue to grow, while quarantine and restrictive measures will have to be extended.

In the USA, the pandemic progressed from 1,000 to 10,000 positive cases within 6 days; in Germany, Italy and Spain - eight days, in Austria - 15 days, and in Russia - 12 days. Five countries have already passed the mark of 100,000 patients within 15 or18 days.



Irresponsibility of citizens, especially young people who mistakenly believe that they are out of risk, makes preventive measures for the spread of the infection a lot less effective. The virus can affect anyone regardless of age. Moreover, nothing is known about the consequences that Covid-19 may cause for the human body. It may decrease physical stamina and change psychological peculiarities.



Tatyana Golikova, the Vice Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, believes that Russia is not going to be able to lift restrictions by May holidays.

""We do want to get out of this crisis on the eve of such a great holiday as Victory Day, but

we definitely won't be able to extricate from the crisis,"" she said.

In order to assess the situation, one needs to live through two cycles of 14 days in an epidemic (the average duration of the incubation period of the coronavirus). The first cycle is ending early this week, when specialists can say whether the situation with the spread of the virus has reached a plateau or continues to grow.



For the time being, the crisis continues to aggravate. Every days brings new records:

as many as 2,558 cases of new infection were confirmed in Russia within the last 24 hours

the number of positive cases of the infection grows in Russia by 25-30 percent

as of April 13, a total of 18,328 cases were registered in 82 regions in the country.

Russian authorities lose time

The Moscow authorities were forced to switch to stringent measures after they chose to start with soft restrictions two weeks ago. During this time, the number of infected people in Russia grew from 1,000 to 18,000.



Leading Russian economists earlier warned that non-working days without travel and social communication restrictions would be perceived as an unexpected holiday. Indeed, many chose to go to their dachas, others flocked to parks and other places of mass congregation of people.

A similar mistake was made a month before in Italy and led to disastrous consequences. Soft quarantine and non-working days led to an increase in morbidity rate. Italy declared strict quarantine, but it was too late.

Since last Monday, the number of infected people has doubled, while the infection rate has tripled. More than 11,500 coronavirus-positive patients are being treated at Moscow hospitals.

In late March, Muscovites were outraged by the ""draconian measures,"" which Mayor Sergei Sobyanin introduced in the city. Presently, it has become clear to everyone that the crisis in Moscow is rapidly developing according to scenarios of Italy or New York.

Today, everyone knows about the need for masks, disposable gloves and sanitizers.

Remote medicine will be developing as well. It goes about personal health monitoring systems. Many people can already monitor their basic vial signs, such as heartrate, blood pressure, we can track the number of steps taken and calories burned — one does not need to go to the hospital for this.

Many conservative things will also change. In the field of travel, for example, after quarantine is lifted, all tourists will be required to take tests and show certificates proving that they have no coronavirus infection.

Sergei Savelyev, deputy head for international cooperation of Russia's federal space agency Roscosmos, accused U.S. President Donald Trump of trying to expropriate resources of the Moon and other celestial bodies after the US president signed an executive order in support of commercial space exploration.

""Aggressive plans to seize territories of other planets can hardly encourage the countries to fruitful cooperation. History knows examples when one country decided to start seizing territories in its own interests, and everyone remembers what came out of it,"" Savelyev said.

On April 6, Donald Trump signed an executive order in support of the commercial development of resources on the Moon and other celestial bodies, instructing the US administration to object attempts to consider outer space as common property of mankind. The text of the document was distributed by the press service of the White House.

""Americans should have the right to engage in commercial exploration, extraction, and use of resources in outer space in accordance with applicable law. States are not party to the Moon Agreement. In addition, the United States does not consider the Moon Agreement to be an effective or necessary tool for the leadership of nation states regarding the promotion of commercial participation in the long-term exploration, scientific discovery and use of the Moon, Mars or other celestial bodies,"" the order reads.

According to the document, the State Department and other ministries and departments should conduct negotiations at the international level to conclude bilateral and multilateral agreements on the use, development and extraction of resources on the Moon and other celestial bodies by private and public companies. The Secretary of State must report on the work done within 180 days.



The document, in particular, says that the United States does not recognize the the Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (commonly known as the Moon Treaty), which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1979.

""The Secretary of State shall object to any attempt by any other state or international organization to treat the Moon Agreement as reflecting or otherwise expressing customary international law,"" Trump's executive order says.

According to the US administration, the order does not introduce any changes to US policy, but strengthens the current position and confirms the 2015, which allowed Americans and American companies to conduct commercial development and production of space resources, including water and minerals.

Scientists from the University of Hong Kong have found at which temperatures the novel coronavirus remains most and least active. According to them, the virus remains highly stable for a long time at a temperature of about +4 degrees Celsius. In the absence of disinfection, its activity begins to decline only after 14 days.



COVID-19 is very sensitive to high temperatures: it dies within five minutes at +70 °C. At +56 ° C, the virus remains active for less than half an hour, at +37 degrees - for no more than two days, and at a temperature of 22 degrees - for about a week.

Scientists find how long coronavirus can live on various surfaces

On the outer side of medical masks the virus lives for at least a week at room temperature and relative humidity of 65 percent. Coronavirus stays on paper for less than three hours, on wooden surfaces and fabrics - for not more than two days, on glass - for less than four days, on stainless steel and plastic - for no longer than a week.



It is worthy of note that reusable face masks made of fabric, which many people tend to use nowadays instead of disposable medical masks (or due to the shortage of them) can be used repeatedly only after meticulous disinfection. As with disposable medical masks, cloth masks need to be changed every two to three hours of constant use.

At home, cloth masks need to be washed with soap or detergent and then treated with a steam generator or steam iron.

After disinfection, one should press the mask with hot iron without steaming it to kill all the germs that can live in moist fabric.

As medical specialists all over the world emphasize, such masks are intended primarily for sick individuals in the first place. They can be effective only in combination with other prophylactic measures (avoiding contact, frequent washing of hands, disinfection of items and surfaces, etc.). In addition, the mask should be worn by people who provide medical care for sick individuals.



Healthy people can wear the mask when visiting public places, using public transport, but the effectiveness of the mask in such situations has not been proven. Disposable medical masks made of non-woven material should not be reused or disinfected.

Coronavirus pandemic to end this summer?

Specialists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that 90% of cases of COVID-19 infection occurred at temperatures ranging from 3 to 17°C and absolute humidity from 4 to 9 g/m³. If their assumption is correct, warm and humid weather in the coming months may improve the situation in many countries of the Northern Hemisphere, whereas the situation in the countries of the Southern Hemisphere may worsen. However, this does not mean that coronavirus will not spread in countries with warm and humid climate.



For example, in Thailand, where temperatures remain at about 30 degrees Centigrade all the year round, coronavirus remains active and tough measures to combat it. At the same time, the novel virus is now actively spreading in Syria and turkey, where temperatures already near +25C. Some specialists believe that climate shows no influence on the new coronavirus as it has spread on all continents, except Antarctica. This is just an observation as there is still no scientific base to explain the nature of the new coronavirus.",7.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

Russian scientists managed to completely decipher the first complete genome of the new coronavirus, which they received from an infected patient, a message posted on the website of the Russian Healthcare Ministry sad.

The breakthrough achievement was made by specialists of the Research Institute of Influenza named after A.A. Smorodintsev.

Chief researcher of the institute, Dmitry Lioznov, said that genome sequencing would help to understand the evolution of the virus and the dynamics of its spread. It will also be helpful in the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs for the treatment of coronavirus.

The information, which the Russian scientists have been able to obtain, was sent to the WHO database so that other research groups could have access to it.

The scientists took a photo of the coronavirus. The photo was taken by the staff of the laboratory of the Novosibirsk State Scientific Center for Virology and Biotechnology ""Vector."" The picture was taken with the use of the negative contrast method on JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope.

The particle size is 100-120 nm. Russian scientists already had the coronavirus gene, which they received from China in January. Back then, the scientists started working on a vaccine against the virus even though they did not have a living strain of the new virus.

In late February, Chinese scientists announced that they had developed a vaccine against coronavirus, but the drug requires further verification and refinement.



There are several research groups in the world that develop the vaccine against COVID-19. In addition to Russian scientists, scientists in China, the USA and Italy are involved in this work. According to the World Health Organization, clinical trials were launched a few days ago. This became possible only two months after scientists managed to analyze the genetic sequence of the virus. However, the vaccine is expected to be widely distributed in the world in no less than 12-18 months.",7.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a new extension of “non-working days” that were declared nationwide in order to combat the spread of coronavirus infection COVID-19. Without waiting for the expiration of the previous deadline (April 30), Putin announced that all days through May 11 would be non-working days in Russia.

Traditionally, Russians celebrate May holidays from May 1 till May 9 with just a few working days between them. Many prefer to take a few days off to spend a full-fledged ten-day vacation to spend it either abroad or working in gardens.

Putin explained the need to prolong the tough measures to combat COVID-19 with the fact that the epidemic in Russia has not reached its peak yet.

“We are now facing a new, perhaps the most intense stage of the fight against the epidemic. All of us will need utmost composure, discipline and mobilization. We must make sure that the wave of the epidemic subsides and finally declines,” Putin said.

Anna Popova, the head of Rospotrebnadzor (environmental watchdog), noted that during the new period of non-working days one should maintain the self-isolation regime and other restrictions.

“This is the third incubation period for the entire period of non-working days that should interrupt the chain of transmission of the virus,” Popova said.

She said earlier that stringent restrictions need to be extended for at least another two weeks.

“We can’t stop halfway. So far, we have been in the phase of severe restrictive measures for only two incubation periods for this disease. In order to stop the spread of the virus and be completely sure that we will pass the point of no return, this is absolutely not enough,” Popova said.

On March 25, in his televised address to the nation in connection with the fight against the spread of coronavirus infection COVID-19, the president declared a non-working week from March 30 to April 5. On April 2, the president made a new appeal to the nation, having extended the non-working regime until April 30.

On April 28, it became known that Russia left Iran behind and took the 8th place in the world in the number of officially registered patients with COVID-19. As of April 27, 93,558 cases of COVID-19 were recorded in the country (+6411 over the last 24 hours), 867 people died.",7.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

Yesterday, President Vladimir Putin admitted that it could be possible to use ""opportunities"" and ""reserves"" of the Ministry of Defense in the fight against the spread of coronavirus in Russia. Representatives of the ministry said, however, that they estimate the situation with the coronavirus infection in the armed forces as ""unstable.""

As of March 30, three Russian military personnel were confirmed positive for COVID-19 infection, at least 133 more people remain under medical observation due to their contacts with the infected.



The Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation decided not to cancel the spring draft and intends to recruit 135,000 conscripts, although they are not going to be sent to military troops in the near future.

The epidemiological situation in the Russian armed forces is unstable, an unnamed source said. The ministry has prepared nearly 5,000 beds at 32 military hospitals, 11 of which ""are ready for work within four hours under strict anti-epidemic conditions."" Forty-nine mobile sanitary-epidemiological groups were also set up for an operational response. The Ministry has 2 million medical disposable masks, 15,000 respirators, 100 insulating transport capsules, 10,000 disposable suits for infectious disease specialists, 3,000 medical protective suits of the Quartz type and continues purchasing necessary items.

It is worth noting that even in an emergency-case scenario, Russia will not be able to directly take advantage of the experience gained abroad. All military personnel arriving from foreign trips undergo a ""mandatory two-week observation"". This also applies to military doctors who are now serving in Italy and Serbia.",7.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0

Most Russians (80%) started going out less or stopped doing it completely as coronavirus continues spreading in Russia.

An opinion poll conducted by WCIOM All-Russian Research Fund, showed that the number of Russians who leave their homes for a walk has dropped twice. As many as 76% of respondents admitted that they started going to grocery stores or pharmacies a lot less frequently.

The absolute majority of respondents refused from personal meetings with friends and acquaintances - 84%.

69% said that they stopped shaking hands and giving hugs when meeting friends and acquaintances.

76 percent of the polled said that leave homes for urgent needs less frequently too.

88% of Muscovites said that they stopped leaving homes.

69%, said that they stopped meeting with their elderly relatives.

77% of Muscovites said that they avoid tactical contacts, while 58% stopped doing it completely.

90% of Muscovites have completely isolated themselves from friends and acquaintances.

Although the self-isolation index data show that Russians began to violate this regime more often, the majority (90%) of Muscovites polled by VTsIOM claim that most of their friends and relatives observe the rules of self-isolation. In Russia, the figure is lower, but not significantly - Most Russians (63%) assess the measures of the Russian authorities as sufficient. Over the five days since March 29, the share of those sharing this position increased by 11%, and the share of those who evaluated the measures as insufficient fell from 38% (March 29) to 26% (April 2).",7.5,Very low,Right,Russia,0
