The U.S. is fast approaching a full 100,000 Coronavirus deaths, but this weekend, Trump went golfing at a course in northern Virginia that’s a part of his own company. During a recent appearance on MSNBC, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) delivered a memorable takedown of the efforts from the president and his allies to distract Americans from the actual devastation at hand. Ahead of the November election, Trump seems desperate to rush into any kind of rhetoric except the reality of the situation.

As Schiff summarized on Twitter:

‘Over 90,000 Americans have died from COVID-19. Our economy is in a downward spiral to Great Depression-levels. Trump doesn’t want the public to focus on his tragic failures. So, to paraphrase Steve Bannon, in order to distract: His people are flooding the zone with excrement.’

The conspiracy theories from the president and his allies have been numerous at this point. Towards the beginning of the crisis, the president even claimed that concern about the virus was a “hoax” and suggested that coverage of the then-growing crisis was some kind of plot to make him look bad. That obviously was not true. More recently, the president’s team’s conspiracy theories have included the idea that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine is some kind of untapped goldmine for Coronavirus treatment, but a new study reveals that among tens of thousands of Coronavirus cases, usage of the drug was linked with a higher death rate across the board.

Hydroxychloroquine, the antimalarial drug touted by President Trump, is linked to increased risk of death in coronavirus patients, according to analysis of 96,000 patients published in the Lancet. Hydroxychloroquine is unproven for fighting coronavirus. https://t.co/LpHS9CuEmL — MSNBC (@MSNBC) May 23, 2020

Most recently, Trump staged a spectacle at a White House press conference on Friday when he claimed that governors must allow churches and other houses of worship to reopen this weekend or else he would “override” them and reopen the churches himself. Trump has no authority to “override” governors, and besides, religious and political authorities around the country have already been collaborating on the development of safe reopening plans for houses of worship. Trump’s spectacle was for show.

The country is quickly approaching a total of 100,000 deaths due to the virus, and tens of millions of people have filed for unemployment claims throughout recent weeks, indicating staggeringly sky-high unemployment rates. What’s the president of the United States doing this weekend while the crisis rages on? He’s golfing at a property branded with his own name.

Now that Trump has arrived at the golf course, we know why. https://t.co/Od29ODSUlW — Renato Mariotti (@renato_mariotti) May 23, 2020

After having stayed away from Trump-branded golf courses since all the way back in the beginning of March, President Donald Trump visited one of his golf courses in north Virginia this Saturday. NBC’s Kelly O’Donnell reported:

‘The president was spotted by pool in white hat, white shirt and the motorcade has left the WH compound. Could this be his first golf outing since early March during stay at Mar-A-Lago? More to come.’

And the president has arrived at his Sterling Virginia golf property. His first visit to a Trump branded course since March 8th. https://t.co/Ar4w3HPfRO — Kelly O'Donnell (@KellyO) May 23, 2020

Indeed — the trip was apparently not announced ahead of time, but yes, Trump ended up visiting one of his golf courses this Saturday morning. The Trump Organization started the process of reopening their golf courses in early May. They’d been closed amidst the national social distancing demands meant to help stem the spread of the Coronavirus. Trump has consistently seemed eager to lift those social distancing demands, no matter the potential ensuing negative effects on public health — and it’s definitely not beyond the current president for concern about getting back on the golf course to have driven his eagerness to dismiss public health guidelines. At one point, he even tweeted that his followers should “liberate” certain states that were under stay-at-home guidelines — including the state of Virginia, where his golf course that he visited this weekend is located.

Condemnation for the president promptly poured in. As political commentator Jon Favreau put it:

‘Trump won’t do anything else to stop a virus that’s killed 100,000 Americans. He won’t do anything else to fix an economy where 40 million are out of work. He will golf, though!’

He’s repeatedly touted the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a supposedly useful treatment against the Coronavirus, but there has never been any kind of systematic evidence of the drug’s actual effectiveness. Now, there’s a new study available outlining how among tens of thousands of Coronavirus patients, the drug was actually linked to a documented higher risk of death. This week, Hillary Clinton called out Trump for recklessly endangering lives with his glib promotion of the drug.

Antimalarial drug touted by Pres Trump is linked to increased risk of death in coronavirus patients, according to one study. An analysis of 96K patients shows those treated with hydroxychloroquine were also more likely to suffer irregular heart rhythms. https://t.co/XfW8r7KIe6 — Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) May 22, 2020

She posted on Twitter:

‘A study of 96,000 coronavirus patients found that those who received a drug Trump has promoted as a treatment had a “significantly higher risk of death compared with those who did not.” The president needs to stop playing a doctor on TV.’

Trump has actually been taking the drug himself, too. He started taking the drug, supposedly, after one of his personal valets tested positive for the Coronavirus, although again, there has never been any kind of systematic evidence that the drug is actually useful for preventing the virus. In fact, one recent story circulated of a woman who contracted the Coronavirus even after she took the drug in question for 19 years as a treatment for lupus, which it’s actually approved for and useful against.

The latest study covering tens of thousands of patients is not the first suggesting that hydroxychloroquine is linked to a higher risk of death among Coronavirus patients. One study outlining results from the VA hospital system has already revealed that among veterans, the drug was also linked to a higher risk of death among Coronavirus cases. None of these developments have seemed to faze the president away from his commitment to promoting his attempts at some kind of magic fix.

⚠️BREAKING: huge Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine study of 96,000 patients at 671 hospitals found:

📌Increased risk of DEATH by 33-45%

📌Increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia by 2.3x to 5x.

📌Not a trial but a large longitudinal study.

Their dislike of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has not softened even a little in the four years since she ran against him. Certainly, she turns off others for a variety of reasons, but when she strikes back at Trump, it really hurts.

Thursday, Clinton pointed her rapier wit at the president for being hypocritical, lying, and threatening. She noted that he voted by mail, too:

‘Trump himself votes by mail but is spreading lies and making threats to prevent his fellow Americans from pursuing the same option during an epidemic. It’s clear we’ll have to work to protect safe access to the ballot box this fall.’

The thing is that all of the president’s men have told him Republicans only win when they manage to limit the number of people who can vote. If people can vote by mail, say during a coronavirus pandemic, they will vote him out of office.

Clinton is right when she said “we’ll have to work to protect safe access to the ballot box.” It is hard to shut down a voting location when the vote goes by mail. A number of states already have full access to voting by mail, and that may be one reason POTUS has been trying to take down the post office. Never mind that American veterans get all of their medications through the mail.

There will be other ways that Trump tries to limit people’s Constitutional right to vote.

Twitter world went nuts at Clinton getting under Trump’s skin — both pro and con. Check out some of their responses below:
