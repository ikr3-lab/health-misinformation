This is one of the unintended consequences of Stay-At-Home orders that conservatives were mocked for bringing up in March.

The rate of suicide is absolutely staggering. One doctor who called it “unprecedented” said that the medical facility where he works has seen a year’s worth of suicide attempts in just four weeks.

Doctors at John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek say they have seen more deaths by suicide during this quarantine period than deaths from the COVID-19 virus. Trending: After ‘Suffering In Hell’ During His COVID Treatment Coma, Drummer Rejects Satanic Beliefs The head of the trauma in the department believes mental health is suffering so much, it is time to end the shelter-in-place order. “Personally I think it’s time,” said Dr. Mike deBoisblanc. “I think, originally, this (the shelter-in-place order) was put in place to flatten the curve and to make sure hospitals have the resources to take care of COVID patients.We have the current resources to do that and our other community health is suffering.”… …”We’ve never seen numbers like this, in such a short period of time,” he said. “I mean we’ve seen a year’s worth of suicide attempts in the last four weeks.”

Officially, the medical center supports the lockdowns to reduce the spread of the virus, but it’s clear that the side effects of the lockdown are causing significant harm.

Job losses, social isolation, and hopelessness are going hand-in-hand with state-imposed lockdown orders. In some states, these orders are being extended far beyond the initial timeframe–“15 Days To Slow The Spread” which became “30 Days To Slow The Spread” to “Lock Down Until There’s A Cure.”

Contra Costa County Crisis Center Executive Director Tom Tamura said that generally speaking, the vast majority of people feel better after calling the crisis line. He also said that although calls are up, they’re not up significantly, which he attributes to people being more isolated from their support network.

“I think people have found themselves disconnected from the normal supportive networks that they have, churches and schools and book clubs, you name it,” Tamura said. “And that, coupled with the closure of some counseling services, people were maybe in a little bit of shock.They were trying to weather the storm a bit but as that isolation has grown people have come to realize this isn’t a sprint it is marathon.” Source: ABC 7 News (Emphasis Added)

This is utterly heartbreaking. People are intentionally doing harm to themselves because governments have prioritized physical health over mental health.

People are isolated from their social groups which means that someone that might catch a warning sign that something is wrong and urge an individual to make that call to the crisis center just isn’t there to do that. How many suicide attempts could have been stopped just by allowing people to move in their social circles?

When this whole thing began and we didn’t know much about the virus because it was new and China literally destroyed their data to protect reputation, closing things down for a couple of weeks to make sure our healthcare system wasn’t overwhelmed was an acceptable suggestion to protect public health. That was around 70 days ago.

We know more now, and it turns out that a lot of what we knew was wrong.

The lockdowns may have slowed the spread of the virus, but it was never going to stop it completely. Some scientists are saying that the coronavirus will continue to come back as a seasonal illness.

In the meantime, we’ve completely changed our society, schools are shut down, businesses may never reopen, we aren’t allowed to go to church, and the government has chosen which jobs are “essential” and which are not.

But the results of the never-ending lockdowns were inevitable–an increase in suicides, businesses closing, and hopelessness.

This is an outrageous statement for Gov. Cuomo who has been basking in the great press he’s received since he began his daily coronavirus briefings while simultaneously bungling the response to the pandemic from the get-go.

Cuomo, (who insists that he’s not being political,) has tried to rewrite history and insist that his policies were put in place because of CDC guidelines…but that’s just not true. Initially, the guidance was to keep hospital beds free for COVID patients which were expected to overwhelm the system.

Despite frequently jousting with the president throughout the pandemic, however, Cuomo betrayed no regrets on adopting that March 25 directive, even with well over 5,000 confirmed or suspected coronavirus deaths now reported in nursing homes. Trending: After ‘Suffering In Hell’ During His COVID Treatment Coma, Drummer Rejects Satanic Beliefs “You have to remember the facts,” the governor said. “The CDC guidance said a nursing home cannot discriminate against a COVID patient.” But the directive was also motivated by a desire to keep hospital beds free by shifting those with minor infections elsewhere, Cuomo continued — even if that meant putting them in nursing homes, among some of the most susceptible to the disease. “Is the best use of a hospital bed to have somebody sit there for two weeks in a hospital bed when they don’t need the hospital bed … and you need that hospital bed for somebody who may die without it?” asked Cuomo. Source: New York Post

Under announced that the State Attorney General is conducting a probe–but not of his disastrous policy, of the facilities that were forced to take the COVID patients.

Let’s rewind just a little and go back to what we knew back before we knew what “social distancing” and “flatten the curve” meant.

All the way back in February, a nursing home in Kirkland, Washington was dealing with the first known outbreak of COVID in the United States. On February 29, the New York Times reported the first COVID death–a healthcare worker in that facility.

in Kirkland, where a health care worker in her 40s at the Life Care Center, a long-term nursing home, and a resident of the center, in her 70s, were reported on Saturday to have tested positive for the virus, health officials expressed alarm at the possibility of more cases. Among 288 residents and workers at Life Care, more than 50 people — 25 health workers and 27 residents — have shown symptoms of respiratory illness or have been hospitalized for pneumonia, local health officials said.

“We are very concerned about an outbreak in a setting where there are many older people,” said Dr. Jeff Duchin, the health officer for Public Health in Seattle and King County. A team of federal health workers was dispatched to Kirkland to assist local workers, and many more coronavirus tests were expected to be conducted in the coming days. Older people are much more likely to face serious illness if infected with the coronavirus. They are also much more likely to die. An analysis of Chinese patients found that nearly 15 percent of infected people over age 80 died; of those in their 70s, 8 percent died. Source: New York Times (Emphasis Added) From the very beginning, we knew that the elderly were a high-risk group. This wasn’t a surprise. This is still the case, in many places all over the world, the majority of COVID deaths are occurring in nursing homes. Even the CDC guidelines that Cuomo is referring to say that COVID patients are to be isolated within the nursing home and extra precautions should be taken. Cuomo had said that New York nursing homes should be prepared to take COVID patients and if they can’t manage that, then “they lose that patient.” The thing is, his March 25 order didn’t allow a nursing home to refuse patients. We know that the state knew that this was a terrible policy because they sent body bags with COVID patients returning to nursing homes. New York state has seen 5,300 deaths in nursing homes from COVID-19 (that we know of) and the infection rate continues to soar.

The coronavirus pandemic has claimed the lives of nearly 5% of nursing home residents in New York State. As CBS2’s Tony Aiello reports, Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s defense of a controversial nursing home policy is not going over well with critics who say CDC guidelines alone can’t be blamed for the overwhelming number of deaths. At the Gurwin Home in Commack, they celebrate every recovery from COVID-19 – uplifting moments amid the painful loss of almost 30 residents. A March 25 directive is cited by many for contributing to the more than 5,000 New York nursing home deaths from COVID-19-related illnesses

Source: CBS (Emphasis Added)

The Associated Press reports that a huge number of COVID patients who were infected and infectious were sent into nursing homes.

NEW YORK — More than 4,300 recovering coronavirus patients were sent to New York’s already vulnerable nursing homes under a controversial state directive that was ultimately scrapped amid criticisms it was accelerating the nation’s deadliest outbreaks, according to a count by The Associated Press. AP compiled its own tally to find out how many COVID-19 patients were discharged from hospitals to nursing homes under the March 25 directive after New York’s Health Department declined to release its internal survey conducted two weeks ago. It says it is still verifying data that was incomplete. Whatever the full number, nursing home administrators, residents’ advocates and relatives say it has added up to a big and indefensible problem for facilities that even Gov. Andrew Cuomo — the main proponent of the policy — called “the optimum feeding ground for this virus.”

Governor Cuomo can keep trying to shift the blame to the federal government, but that’s disingenuous. He was happy to take the glory when the press was blowing sunshine up his butt early on, but now that it’s clear that he made some tremendous missteps, he’s trying to pass it off on the CDC recommendations.

Well, that’s just not going to work. He didn’t follow the CDC guidelines properly by considering the nursing homes on a case-by-case basis. Cuomo’s rule didn’t permit the facilities to refuse COVID-positive patients.

The buck does stop with the governor. New York voters should remember that.

Biden’s Campaign Vetting Klobuchar As Potential Running Mate,https://clashdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Joe-Amy.jpeg,"The Senator from Minnesota has been asked by the Biden campaign to submit materials for consideration. No word if she threw the binder at the staffers.

Senator Klobuchar(D-MN) is officially going through the “invasive” vetting process as a potential running mate for Joe Biden.

Klobuchar is just the latest in the list of candidates being floated.

CBS News broke the story yesterday.

Trending: After ‘Suffering In Hell’ During His COVID Treatment Coma, Drummer Rejects Satanic Beliefs The request for information from potential running mates like Klobuchar “is underway,” a senior Biden campaign aide tells CBS News. If a potential contender consents, she should be poised to undergo a rigorous multi-week review of her public and private life and work by a hand-picked group of Biden confidantes, who will review tax returns, public speeches, voting records, past personal relationships and potentially scandalous details from her past… …Biden has publicly credited Klobuchar for strong debate performances and for helping him win Minnesota, a victory that came only after she and other contenders dropped out just hours before March’s Super Tuesday primaries that helped propel Biden into the lead. He is on track to officially clinch the Democratic presidential nomination next month after several states hold primaries rescheduled because of the coronavirus pandemic… …”I need someone who’s going to be, as Barack said, ‘simpatico with me,’ who is a real partner in progress and is ready to be president on a moment’s notice,” Biden said recently. “There are a lot of women out there with the experience to do that job.” Source: CBS News

The question isn’t “Is America ready for a female Vice President”, it’s “Is America ready for a female Vice President that ate salad with a comb and made her staffer clean it after she was finished?”

Klobuchar’s anger problems are legendary–it’s the stuff of NYTimes columns and mockery in The Atlantic.

This might be the very first zero personality ticket for president in the history of the United States.

Don’t believe me? Check out Amy Klobuchar’s “joke” that she keeps telling.

Amy Klobuchar has a joke she'd like you to hear pic.twitter.com/5mh5IQepva — The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) September 6, 2019

On the plus side, Klobuchar seems to have a very good memory and if Joe forgets what he’s doing, she’ll just throw a stapler at him–or maybe one of Speaker Pelosi’s commemorative pens. (After all, she’s going to be the one pulling Joe’s strings.)

As for Joe, he’s just a shadow of his former self.

Not only can he no longer be “flirty” with women with unwanted touching and hair-sniffing because of the MeToo era and a sexual assault accusation against him, he’s just falling apart.

Here is his April 2019 video announcing that he was entering the race for President:

Joe has always been gaffe-prone, but clearly something has changed in just the past few months.

There has been a distinct decline in Joe’s mental acuity and having him locked down in his Delaware home due to coronavirus is helping him hide it. Unfortunately, he still has to do some campaigning, and when he does, it’s pretty clear that things are not so great with Joe.

Here he is forgetting who the health experts briefing him on coronavirus are–despite his near-constant use of notes.

Yikes!

He’s literally got a binder with all of his information in front of him–unless Klobuchar got her hands on it and threw it at some staffer for the Biden Virtual Rally “glitches.”

Don’t get me wrong, Klobuchar is perhaps the least insane of the Democrats that decided to run for the nomination, and wouldn’t actually be the most awful pick. She just has the likeability of a turnip. She’s also a “moderate” from a purple state and that may not go over well with the Bernie Bro/AOC/”Democratic Socialist” wing of the Democratic party. But perhaps its because “moderate” Joe has morphed into Bernie Lite and needs someone moderate to balance him out.

Whoever wins these “Veepstakes” it’s clear that their primary job will be to prop up Joe Biden.

Not gonna lie, I’d be a little worried.

During this pandemic, some people have taken the opportunity to create some new products to help with the fight against the virus that has caused global lockdowns and over 300,000 deaths worldwide.

Online platforms like Zoom and GoToMeeting have adjusted their platforms for high-demand use so that more people can work remotely and have kids continue the school year with online classes. We’ve discovered that while it’s clearly not for everyone, it’s not so bad.

Trending: After ‘Suffering In Hell’ During His COVID Treatment Coma, Drummer Rejects Satanic Beliefs

We’ve seen actual innovation, though. Just a couple of examples include the doctors in Oregon who created a 3D printed ventilator for $10 and an app that helps with “social distancing” by limiting the number of customers in stores by creating “virtual queues.” It’s a win-win for businesses and consumers.

But some “innovations” just sound like a bad idea from the get-go.

Like this cardboard hospital bed that can be turned into a coffin. It is specifically designed for COVID patients.

Would you let your loved one be put in that?

Now, I’m not against a sign company looking to meet a need in the community and repurpose their facility for that.

BUT… there’s just so much wrong with this.

First, having a hospital bed that converts into a coffin is just ghoulish. We don’t send people to the hospital expecting them to die. There is no hope left when someone is put in a bed that could instantly be converted into their coffin.

Second, it’s made of cardboard. That’s dehumanizing. This isn’t a small pet that you bury in the backyard in a shoebox, these are human beings not Speedy the Wonder Hamster that your third-grader is crying over.

Remind me, what happens when cardboard gets wet? Because that could be a problem. You clearly can’t clean someone on this thing, and what about feeding? What happens if someone spills water on it? The biggest problem that I see is that the body itself contains fluids like blood, saliva, sputum, urine, and other things, all of which can spread disease. Even if this thing was treated to be “waterproof” you’d have to toss it the minute bodily fluids touched it and in a hospital setting that would be in pretty short order.

This is a clear case of “didn’t think that one through” and “didn’t consult with a single medical professional.”

But you know that morons in government are going to see this as a brilliant and much-needed innovation in the midst of a pandemic.

Speaking of morons in government…

These bed/coffin combo units might be Governor Cuomo’s new state-mandated nursing home beds–because that completely fits with his policies. Maybe he’ll add in blankets that can double as a body-bag since he’s already sending body bags to nursing homes.

[Quick Update from the author: I think I’m being unfair to Governor Cuomo who has rescinded his disastrous policy that forces nursing homes to take COVID-positive patients now that thousands of people senselessly died. I should also include the other governors who sent COVID-positive patients into nursing homes but have not rescinded the order like New Jersey’s Phil Murphy and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, as well as those simply covering up the data like California’s Gavin Newsom.]

But they are strangely silent about a story staring them right in the face.

In February and early March, it was clear from events unfolding in Washington State that retirement homes were particularly vulnerable to this outbreak. This should hardly come as a surprise to anyone familiar with the risk that even more mundane illnesses can trigger life-threatening cases of pneumonia, considering that this virus specifically inflames the lower respiratory tract.

As of March 26th, a letter to the WSJ and a phone call to the Mark Levin Show by a nursing home administrator in New York strenuously protested Cuomo’s new order that obligated nursing homes to accept infectious coronavirus patients into their care.

Tragically, Gov Cuomo later dismissed any objections as financially motivated in his press conferences. At the time, the objection was raised, she was unable to get any New York officials to listen — and unable to contact any parties directly.

Trending: After ‘Suffering In Hell’ During His COVID Treatment Coma, Drummer Rejects Satanic Beliefs

The consequences following that fateful order were every bit as devastating as they were predictable.

Janice Dean, Senior Meteorologist at Fox News, shared her story on Twitter — one that puts a personal face on the horrors unfolding in a much-neglected story.

It said:

Dear friends,

As most of you know, both of my husband’s parents died of covid in different nursing/assisted living residences here in New York. Because of this, it’s hard for me to be an objective person when it comes to this story. But the fact is, there aren’t a lot of news outlets covering this tragedy which I believe should be one of the biggest stories of the covid19 pandemic of 2020. So, please forgive me for my raw horror, grief and fury. If there’s anything I can say having lived through this, is that I will do my best to be a voice for all those who don’t have one. There needs to be a real investigation into how bad decisions and poor preparation let a virus ravage our most vulnerable. They had no way to defend themselves, and it will haunt my family forever.

This is the same Gov Cuomo who looked directly into the camera — two days before that WSJ article pleaded with New York not to send infectious patients into nursing homes — and ironically told us, ‘My mother is not expendable and your mother is not expendable.’

Whether he realized it or not, his own decisions MADE them expendable now, didn’t they?

Somehow New York’s Cuomo — so beloved of the media — and the roundly demonized DeSantis handled their most vulnerable populations quite differently. Unlike New York and a few other states, Florida issued no order compelling nursing homes to accept infectious patients. The doomsday scenario they said would certainly befall Florida never materialized… certainly not on the scale the Chicken Little crowd had predicted.

The Nursing Home fatality statistic has become so humiliating for Cuomo that his administration quietly changed the reporting rules for Nursing Home fatalities so that it wouldn’t reflect so poorly on him. Cuomo’s Officials Caught Cooking The Books On Nursing Home Deaths

It’s curious, isn’t it, that media types so hellbent on attributing the responsibility of each and every death to the President so easily gloss over specific policy choices that endangered — or even ended — so very many innocent lives.

According to NY Times data on nursing homes, the states where ""new cases are increasing"" have the highest share of nursing home deaths from COVID-19 (52% vs 35%). Yet we continue to focus on beach activity and blanket lockdowns as opposed to protecting those in nursing homes. — James Todaro, MD (@JamesTodaroMD) May 20, 2020

Hopefully, stories like the tragic one of Janice Dean’s in-laws perishing in a potentially preventable situation will make this issue personal enough that it won’t be waved away by the ‘mainstream’ press as just another cold statistic.

Sometimes, a personal story is the only way to effectively carry a message through an otherwise noisy news cycle.

If you doubt the truth of that, ask yourself — how many people remember the 10,000 massacred in Tianmen Square. And how many remember that one iconic photo of ‘Tank Man’?

Keep sharing your stories.

And some of us will do what we can to make sure others hear them too. It’s the only way that those lives were endangered by their own government will have their story told, and will see, perhaps, some small measure of justice after the fact.
