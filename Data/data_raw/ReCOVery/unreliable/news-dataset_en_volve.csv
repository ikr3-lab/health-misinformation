Dr. Anthony Fauci appeared for interviews Friday and dropped a grenade into the nation’s reopening conversation.

Stay-at-home orders intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus could end up causing “irreparable damage” if imposed for too long, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNBC on Friday. “I don’t want people to think that any of us feel that staying locked down for a prolonged period of time is the way to go,” Fauci said during an interview with CNBC’s Meg Tirrell on “Halftime Report.”

Indeed. The country has only been discussing this very topic for weeks now, as between 38.6 and 43 million Americans have been thrown into unemployment thanks directly to the coronavirus shutdown.

The discussion has not included Dr. Fauci, and he appears to have been sidelined from making public comments by the White House in recent days. During those same days, President Trump has increasingly called for states to lift restrictions and let the reopening begin.

During the same interview, Dr. Fauci poured some cold water on reopenings that are underway, but in that passive-aggressive way of doing so without being specific.

“In general, I think most of the country is doing it in a prudent way,” he said. “There are obviously some situations where people might be jumping over that. I just say please proceed with caution if you’re going to do that.”

Not helpful. Who is jumping ahead? Florida — which has not seen a spike despite dire media predictions that it would? Texas — which is crab-walking toward reopening while about 46% of its coronavirus deaths statewide have been in nursing homes? Or is California taking entirely too long? How about Michigan and the whimsical Gov. Whitmer?

People need to work. The economy crashes and a whole lot more people will die the longer the shutdowns drag on.

While some in the capital cocktail set see Dr. Fauci as a sex symbol, he has been a panic peddler during much of this crisis.

For instance, May 13, 2020: As states reopened, Dr. Fauci warned of “needless suffering and death” if states move too fast.

Unemployment was already well over 20 million by then, or roughly the whole population of the state of New York. A million of those newly unemployed are healthcare workers. Hospitals and medical practices have been creaking and threatening to collapse since early April.

Since then, we’ve blown past that unemployment number, past Florida, past Texas, to leave the equivalent of the entire population of California unemployed.

Plus or minus a million or two.

How, in what universe, can unemployment on this scale not cause “irreparable damage?”

Especially when an estimated 42% of these unemployed and their jobs are never ever ever getting back together?

Our energy sector went from powering everything to being vulnerable to foreign takeover in a flash.

Whole national job-creating companies have filed for bankruptcy or laid thousands of their workers off.

And the federal government is writing hot checks in the trillions every few weeks.

This is by definition “irreparable damage,” Dr. F.

I haven’t been too critical of Fauci up to this point. He’s an epidemiologist trying to prevent mass death from a virus. His job is not to worry about the economics.

But it’s looking increasingly like we need a second opinion, from another doctor who also has run a practice and therefore understands economics. As Sen. Rand Paul, who is a doctor, noted in Senate testimony in mid-May, Dr. Fauci isn’t the “be all end all” of this crisis. Dr. Fauci actually agreed. And he’s not.

The economic dimension of this crisis has long stayed in the back seat while the healthcare dimension took the wheel. That was reasonable in the beginning. It’s a pandemic, which is a medical crisis first and foremost.

They both need some time in the driver’s seat. We’ve flattened the curve. There’s no evidence at this point (it could change!) that reopening is causing serious spikes in new infections. We still haven’t come to grips with the facts on nursing home and assisted living facitlity-related coronavirus deaths nationwide. That discussion has not happened in any serious way.

Neither has the necessary discussion about suicides related to economic misery.

We’re past time for all that.

President Trump acknowledged Thursday that there could be a second wave of the coronavirus epidemic later this year, but flatly stated he wouldn’t let any further outbreaks shutter the economy again.

“People say that’s a very distinct possibility,” Trump said when asked a possible second wave while in Michigan. “It’s standard. And, we’re going put out the fires. We’re not going to close the country.”

Trump’s comments came as he was touring a Ford Motor Co. plant outside of Detroit that has converted its automobile manufacturing facility into one making ventilators. During a speech at the plant, the president praised Ford workers for their efforts to produce thousands of ventilators during the pandemic.

“The global pandemic proves once and for all that for America to be a strong nation, America needs to be a manufacturing nation,” Trump said. “I’m fighting to bring back our jobs from China and many other countries.”

Conservative radio host Buck Sexton said Trump had told this to him during a White House interview Wednesday, saying, “We will not do a lockdown for the second wave that is likely to come in the winter.”

During his speech, the president also lashed out at China for its role in the coronavirus pandemic.

“It came in from China and it should have been stopped in China,” he said.

The first reports of the contagion surfaced late last year in Wuhan, the sprawling capital of Central China’s Hubei province, and the disease quickly spread across the globe. As of Thursday, over 5 million people have been infected worldwide with over 329,000 deaths, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. – READ MORE",7.5,Very low,Right,,0
