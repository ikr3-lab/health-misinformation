The Office of Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei announced Sunday as Ei-al-Fitr after it received multiple reports from reliable religious scholars on the sighting of the new moon.

Ayatollah Khamenei would have led the Eid prayers at the Imam Khomeini Grand Prayer Grounds in Tehran as in the past, but the event was cancelled due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

Nevertheless, Eid prayers were held in 110 mosques in the capital under strict health protocols.

Alireza Zali, the head of the National Headquarters for Managing and Fighting the coronavirus in Tehran, asked those with COVID-19 symptoms, people over 65, pregnant women as well as those suffering from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and uncontrolled blood pressure to skip going to public places for Eid prayers.

In a message to Iranians, President Hassan Rouhani congratulated them on Eid al-Fitr, wishing that God would accept their fasting, prayers and good deeds.

Eid al-Fitr marks the beginning of the lunar month of Shawwal and the end of Ramadan — the ninth month in the Islamic calendar — when Muslims refrain from eating, drinking, smoking and other corporal pleasures from dawn to dusk.",17.5,Low,Right,Iran,0

“Non-interference in the affairs of other countries, maintenance of territorial integrity and showing respect for the national sovereignty of other countries are among clear and unchangeable principles of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s foreign policy,” Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Abbas Mousavi said on Sunday.

“Therefore, while emphasizing the importance of respect for the principle of the ‘united China’, the Islamic Republic of Iran condemns any foreign interference in the internal affairs of the People’s Republic of China and any harm to this country’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and underlines the need for ... keeping order to ensure stability, welfare and security of the people of Hong Kong,” the Iranian spokesman said.

Hong Kong was witnessing a renewal of protests on Sunday over a newly-proposed security law as a lockdown imposed over the coronavirus outbreak gradually loosens.

The proposed law was recently submitted for deliberation to the National People’s Congress (NPC) and it aims to boost security measures and safeguard national security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) after violent protests rocked the region for months last year.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Sunday that Hong Kong was an internal affair and no foreign interference would be allowed.

“Aside from the devastation caused by the novel coronavirus, there is also a political virus spreading through the US,” Wang said, adding, “This political virus is the use of every opportunity to attack and smear China. Some politicians completely disregard basic facts and have fabricated too many lies targeting China, and plotted too many conspiracies.”

Meanwhile, White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien warned on Sunday that China's proposed national security legislation for Hong Kong could lead to US sanctions and threaten the city's status as a financial hub.

""It looks like, with this national security law, they're going to basically take over Hong Kong and if they do ... Secretary (of State Mike) Pompeo will likely be unable to certify that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy and if that happens, there will be sanctions that will be imposed on Hong Kong and China,"" O'Brien said on NBC's Meet the Press.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi made the comments at a press conference on the sidelines of an annual parliament meeting on Sunday, following calls from the United States and Australia for a probe into the origins of the novel coronavirus pandemic.

""China is open to working with the international scientific community to look into the source of the virus,"" Wang said, adding, ""At the same time, we believe that this should be professional, fair and constructive.""

""Fairness means the process be free of political interference, respect the sovereignty of all countries, and oppose any presumption of guilt,"" the Chinese diplomat said.

Since the flu-like pathogen broke out in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late December, Beijing and Washington have clashed over the virus spread and its origin, further increasing tensions between the world's two largest economies.

US President Donald Trump keeps referring to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as the Chinese virus. Beijing has hit back by suggesting that the US military brought the virus to Wuhan and initiated the outbreak.

Trump has over the past weeks claimed that there is evidence Beijing created the coronavirus in a medical lab in the Chinese city. This is while the US intelligence agencies say they have seen no evidence to show the virus is “man-made.”

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has on several occasions accused China of not being transparent and honest about the coronavirus pandemic in the country.

China has fiercely defended its handling of the new coronavirus, repeatedly saying it “has been nothing but open, transparent and responsible” in informing the WHO and affected countries about the pandemic.

Scientific studies have already suggested that the virus originated through natural processes.

Wang further blasted US politicians’ effort to ""fabricate rumors"" about the pathogen's origins and ""stigmatize China"".

He also urged the United States to stop wasting time in its fight against the virus deadly and rather than spreading lies and attacking China, share the Asian country’s experience in combating the epidemic.

""Regretfully, in addition to the raging coronavirus, a political virus is also spreading in the United States. This political virus is using every opportunity to attack and smear China,"" Wang said.

""Some politicians have ignored the most basic facts and concocted too many lies about China and plotted too many conspiracies,"" he added.

""I want to say here: Don't waste precious time any longer, and don't ignore lives.""

""What China and the United States need to do the most is to first learn from each other and share their experience in fighting against the epidemic, and help each country fight it.""

When asked if the relations between the US and China and would further worsen, the Chinese Foreign Minister said Beijing remains prepared to work with Washington in the spirit of cooperation and mutual respect.

""China has always advocated that, as the world's largest developing country and the largest developed country, both of us bear a major responsibility for world peace and development,"" he said.

""China and the United States stand to gain from cooperation, and lose from confrontation.""

Since 2018, Washington and Beijing have been engaged in a trade war over issues such as cyber security, regulations, intellectual property, subsidies, and tariffs.

Economists warn that the ongoing trade war between the world’s two largest economies increases the risks of disrupting supply chains, curtailing investment and curbing business confidence in global markets.

More recently, the two top economies have also clashed over the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement and US support for Taiwan, which China claims full sovereignty over it.",17.5,Low,Right,Iran,0

Speaking to the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Tony Hall claimed that 92 percent of BBC personnel have been forced to work from home due to the lockdown and broader coronavirus-related restrictions.

Hall, whose resignation was announced in January, is expected to formally step down as director general in the summer.

Despite the damage inflicted on the state broadcaster by the pandemic, Hall still maintained that British people have “turned to the BBC in their droves” in recent weeks.

However, the outgoing director general did not provide any evidence to support his sweeping claims.

Halls’ unsubstantiated claims stand in stark contrast to a solid body of evidence that the British public is profoundly disillusioned with the BBC and are calling for the license fee to be either scrapped or substantially reduced.

On the highly contentious issue of the license fee, Hall said that he hopes “in future” there will be a “big debate” about how the BBC should be funded post 2027, when the state broadcaster’s current charter expires.

The Democratic Party's presumptive nominee showed in a 30-second clip accompanying his tweet on Saturday that Trump was playing a round of golf at his club in the US state of Virginia on Memorial Day Weekend.

“Nearly 100,000 lives have been lost, and tens of millions are out of work,” the former vice president said in his tweet. “Meanwhile, the president spent his day golfing.”

“The death toll is still rising,” read the ad, which has garnered over 1.3 million views. “The president is playing golf.”

The golf trip was the president’s first visit to one of his money-making properties since March 8, when he visited his private golf club in West Palm Beach during a weekend at his Florida home.

The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global pandemic on March 11, and Trump followed with the national emergency declaration two days later.

Trump has ordered US flags on federal buildings and national monuments to half-staff through Sunday in memory of the Americans who have lost their lives to COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.

US Democrats have criticized Trump since the epidemic erupted in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, saying he has failed to develop a comprehensive and effective plan for testing Americans for the coronavirus and tracing contacts of those who are infected by the virus.

Biden has on several occasions censured Trump since the outbreak started in the United States in February, framing the US president's response to the crisis as inadequate.

In another ad released earlier this month, the Biden campaign accused Trump of mishandling the epidemiological crisis and the economic fallout it caused by failing to implement containment measures sooner.

Virologists say people who contract the coronavirus in the US are at greater risk than those in the UK or Canada since America lacks a national health service.

After a three-week-long absence from public view, the 36-year-old leader made the comments at a meeting of his party’s powerful Central Military Commission, after a previous absence that gave rise to intense global speculation that he might have health issues or even been brain-dead.

According to a report by North Korea's state news agency KCNA on Sunday, the meeting revolved round measures to bolster the peninsular country’s armed forces and “reliably contain the persistent big or small military threats from the hostile forces.”

It also discussed “increasing the nuclear war deterrence of the country and putting the strategic armed forces on a high alert operation,” through adopting “crucial measures for considerably increasing the firepower strike ability of the artillery pieces,” the report added.

Kim’s rare outings during the past two months, with his absence from a key national anniversary, have coincided with North Korea’s intense measures against the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Pyongyang says it has recorded no confirmed cases so far, but South Korea’s intelligence agency claims that it cannot rule out that the North has had an outbreak.

North Korea is under crippling US sanctions for years over Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

US President Donald Trump has attempted to de-escalate tensions with Pyongyang, and although he has met with Kim three times, he has so far refused to relieve any of the harsh sanctions on the North over its military programs, and that has in turn hampered the so-called efforts to demilitarize the Korean Peninsula.

The Washington-Pyongyang nuclear talks have made little progress since late last year, particularly after the global fight to curb the pandemic, which has so far infected more than 5,434, 600 people and killed over 344,500 others around the world.

Kim’s pledge to boost its nuclear capabilities comes at a time when Washington, according to some news reports, might conduct its first full-fledged nuclear test since 1992.

Last December, Kim ended a moratorium on the country’s missile tests and said North Korea would soon develop a “new strategic weapon.”

The ending of the moratorium came as the United States refused to relieve any of the sanctions on the North even though Pyongyang had taken goodwill steps in the course of the now-stalled diplomacy with Washington.

The North is also at loggerheads with South Korea over its “provocative” military drills with the US, stressing that Seoul’s war games demand an appropriate response from Pyongyang.",17.5,Low,Right,Iran,0

Iran’s semi-official Fars News agency said on Sunday that President Hassan Rouhani and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan had discussed the borders reopening in a phone calls held earlier in the day.

Rouhani and Erdogan urged “immediate reopening of land and air borders” while observing hygiene protocols to allow trade between the countries to resume, said the report.

Border closures that began after the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus pandemic, have caused trade between Iran and Turkey to decline significantly in the first quarter this year.

A report by Tehran’s Chamber of Commerce published earlier this month showed that the value of the three-month trade between the neighbors had decreased by 70 percent to stand at $645 million at the end of March.

In his phone call, Rouhani told Erdogan that resumption of economic exchanges between Iran and Turkey was a necessity given the current economic around the world as a result of the pandemic.

Erdogan also vowed to issue orders to expedite the reopening of Turkey’s eastern borders with Iran. The Turkish president also reiterated the need for more cooperation between Iran and Turkey on how to handle the spread COVID-19.

Iran has been the worst affected country in the Western Asia region by the COVID-19 pandemic. Figures published by Iranian health ministry on Sunday showed the number of people tested positive for the disease had increased by 2,180 to reach a total of 135,701.

The number of COVID-19 deaths in Iran increased by 58 to stand at 7,417 people, said a health ministry spokesman, adding that 105,801 patients had recovered from the disease since it was spotted in the country in late February.",17.5,Low,Right,Iran,0

About 80 tents are now neatly spaced out on a wide street near San Francisco City Hall as part of a ""safe sleeping village"" opened last week. The area between the city's central library and its Asian Art Museum is fenced off to outsiders, monitored around the clock and provides meals, showers, clean water and trash pickup.

In announcing the encampment, and a second one to open in the famed Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, San Francisco's mayor acknowledged that she didn't want to approve tents, but having unregulated tents mushroom on sidewalks was neither safe nor fair.

""So while in normal times I would say that we should focus on bringing people inside and not sanctioning tent encampments, we frankly do not have many other options right now,"" she said in a tweet last week.

Nicholas Woodward, 37, is camping at the safe sleeping site, but he said he preferred sleeping in his tent before the city stepped in; he finds the fencing belittling and the rules too controlling. His friend, Nathan Rice, 32, said he'd much rather have a hotel room than a tent on a sidewalk, even if the city is providing clean water and food.

""I hear it on the news, hear it from people here that they're going to be getting us hotel rooms,"" he said. ""That's what we want, you know, to be safe inside.""

San Francisco has moved 1,300 homeless people into hotel rooms and RVs as part of a statewide program to shelter vulnerable people but the mayor has been criticized for moving too slowly. She has said she is not inclined to move all the city's estimated 8,000 homeless into hotels, despite complaints from advocates who say overcrowded tents are a public health disaster.

San Francisco is just the latest city to authorize encampments as shelters across the country move to thin bed counts so homeless people, who are particularly susceptible to the virus due to poor health, have more room to keep apart.

Santa Rosa in Sonoma County welcomed people this week to its first managed encampment with roughly 70 blue tents. Portland, Oregon, has three homeless camps with city-provided sleeping bags and tents, and Maricopa County opened two parking lots to homeless campers in Phoenix.

San Francisco officials have historically frowned upon mini tent cities and routinely rounded up tents on city streets. But with an estimated 150,000 homeless people in California, most of them living out in the open, it's impossible to stamp out the highly visible tents along highways and on crowded urban sidewalks.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that officials not disturb tent encampments during the coronavirus pandemic unless people are given individual hotel rooms, as homeless advocates want to see. Those advocates say providing a safe space where people can get meals, use a toilet and avoid harassing passers-by is a reasonable option given the times.

""The best, best option would be housing. The second-best option would be hotel rooms, but if you can't do that and we're going to have so many people outside then I think it makes sense ... to make those outside as safe as can be,"" said Dr. Margot Kushel, director of the Center for Vulnerable Populations at the University of California, San Francisco.

But Nan Roman, president and CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said the federal government is providing an astonishing amount of money to battle the pandemic and she hopes cities and counties use it to put people into empty hotels, motels and other unused places.

""It's almost like we're giving ourselves permission that it's OK that people will sleep outside, and once we've given ourselves that permission, it's very difficult to get the initiative together to do otherwise,"" she said.

Still, government-sanctioned tent camps may be here to stay, at least until a coronavirus vaccine is distributed.

At the urging of San Francisco Supervisor Sandra Lee Fewer, the city's parks and real estate departments are compiling an inventory of open spaces that might be suitable for tent camps. She said sidewalk space is a coveted commodity for retailers, given coronavirus restrictions, and the city's strategy of adding more shelter beds doesn't make sense with a contagious virus.

""It is just a new world that we're living in,"" she said, ""and it's going to have to be our new normal.""

Citing an unnamed US official, the Israeli daily revealed that the Trump administration has asked Israel to take concrete steps to reduce its ties with China.

So far, “the Israeli side has politely acknowledged our concerns without committing to action,” the unnamed official said.

“I don’t think polite deflection will cut it anymore,” the official said, adding ""this is a high priority for the US.”

One industry that the US has pinpointed as particularly sensitive is technology, so much so that the US has been eyeing Chinese-Israeli joint academic research in the field, the report said.

The US is especially concerned with the billions of dollars Chinese companies have invested in technologies that Israel has classified as commercial, but could be used by Chinese intelligence, like artificial intelligence, satellite communications and cybersecurity.

The demand came just days after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited the occupied territories and asked Israel to reconsider its joint projects with China in areas with security risks and sensitivities for the US, including academic projects and technological research and development.

In previous public statements, US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman and other State Department officials had focused on the establishment of a more robust review process for foreign investments that could pose risks, and a reduction of reliance on China for emergency equipment in light of the coronavirus pandemic.

The US and Israel share some of the most sensitive intelligence with one another. In addition, American contractors sell Israel some of the most classified military hardware and weapons in the US like the F-35 fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, according to the Israeli daily.

The US is concerned that with China building most of Israel’s infrastructure – roads, trains, tunnels, ports and more – it will eventually gain access to the lines of communication through which Israel and the US communicate intelligence with one another. That is something that Washington will not tolerate, said the report.

For too long, Israel has cozied up to China while ignoring potential ramifications or fallout with its greatest ally, the United States, the newspaper said.

However, Tel Aviv could be on a collision course with Washington unless tight restrictions are imposed on Chinese investment in Israel, because the US president sees this both as a geopolitical security threat and a distraction from accomplishing the objectives of his trade war with China.

According to Israel's Army Radio on Tuesday, Tel Aviv has asked Washington for compensation in exchange for reducing ties with China - an offer that the US reportedly rejected.

The ongoing friction between the US and China has escalated in recent months in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, and the US has put pressure on many of its allies as a result.

The US has accused China of hiding news of the original outbreak of the novel coronavirus from the world.

President Trump has long called COVID-19 a “Chinese virus,” going so far as to accuse Chinese President Xi Jinping of standing behind a “disinformation and propaganda attack on the United States and Europe.”

The current venomous rhetoric by Trump and his allies about China’s “culpability” for the COVID-19 pandemic has led to strong reactions from Chinese officials.

China's Ambassador to Israel Du Wei, who was found dead in his official residence in Herzliya last Sunday, had made a high-profile defense of his country’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.

In an interview with Israel's Makor Rishon newspaper in April, Du addressed the matter of Chinese investments in Israel, expressing hope for further cooperation.

He also expressed hope to strengthen the ties between Israel and China, addressing the accusations leveled at his country as being the one responsible for the outbreak of the virus.

Mystery and speculation surrounds the death and comments from readers under an online article in the Jerusalem Post included: “Something smells fishy here.”

Another said there was “a long list of suspects,” and the envoy’s death was like something in a spy movie, or the US murder investigation show CSI (Crime Scene Investigation).

Others suggested a link to Pompeo’s recent whirlwind visit to Israel, during which he was overtly critical of China, and demanded that Israel stop sharing confidential military information with Beijing.",17.5,Low,Right,Iran,0

As millions of Palestinians living in occupation or exile around the world remember the beginning of the Nakba, the Israelis seem determined to keep the 1968 tragedy alive.

US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, met with Israeli government leaders last week to discuss moving forward with their so-called “peace plan” of annexing nearly 30% of the West Bank.

Annexation and the Israeli settlements in the West Bank are both illegal under international law (not to mention the countless war crimes Israeli soldiers and settlers commit in Gaza and the West Bank).

Unsurprisingly, Palestinians have condemned the potential annexation, as have EU officials and Jordan.

But will the Israelis actually follow through with their plans to annex the land? And if so, will that trigger an Intifada or broader regional conflict?

Capitalizing on the chaos of coronavirus

The Zionist entity has already exploited COVID-19 to tighten its grip on the Palestinians.

During the pandemic, Tel Aviv has shut down Palestinian testing sites, restricted medical aid from entering Palestinian territories, continued arresting Palestinians, and refused to release prisoners.

By closing the borders and clamping down on medical aid, Israel can weaponize the coronavirus as a biological weapon for ethnic cleansing. Following suit, the Trump regime blocked COVID-19 assistance to Gaza claiming it would be used for “terrorism.”

However, Tel Aviv also sees it as an ideal opportunity to move forward with annexation.

Most countries around the world are preoccupied fighting their own battles against the pandemic. Israel, on the other hand, is on the downswing with cases flattening. The coronavirus serves as a perfect distraction for Israeli crimes to slip under the radar.

Last week, the Zionist entity approved an additional 7,000 settlements in the West Bank in preparation to vote on annexation.

Will the Israelis actually follow through with it?

The Zionist push for annexation rides on a wave of right-wing populism around the world.

After over a year of political deadlock and three elections, Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing Likud party have reached an agreement to form a coalition government with rival Benny Gantz of the centrist Blue and White party.

On the backdrop of a corruption investigation, Netanyahu faces pressure from his right-wing voting bloc to follow through with reactionary campaign promises such as annexing Palestinian land. One poll found that roughly half of Israeli Jews support annexing West Bank land so long as Washington is on-board.

Netanyahu also must maintain a right-wing strongman posture against centrist Gantz.

However, annexing the West Bank might not necessarily work in Israel’s favor. Several Palestinians already live in the West Bank so Tel Aviv will either need to forcibly remove them or integrate them as Israeli citizens. While it’s certainly not below Israeli standards to violently remove Palestinians, it might prove more trouble than it’s worth should Palestinians put up a fight.

On the other hand, integrating West Bank Palestinians as Israeli citizens would give them voting rights and effectively disband the two-state solution. This is one reason even many reactionary right-wing Israelis don’t support annexation at this time.

If the Israelis are simply looking for US support, however, they’ll have no shortage of that for the foreseeable future.

The Trump regime has declared its unwavering support for the Zionist entity at every turn imaginable. Washington already moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem al-Quds despite outcry from EU allies and Palestinians. Not only does Donald Trump seems poised to secure another four years in the White House, but even Democratic opposition candidate Joe Biden has openly admitted he will not move the US embassy back to Tel Aviv.

So if all they’re waiting for is US support, the Israelis have plenty of that. Whether or not the Israeli legislature will support the motion remains to be seen.

How will Israeli neighbors and allies respond?

Jordan’s King Abdallah told German outlet Der Spiegel he would consider “all options” should Israelis vote to move forward with their annexation plans.

Jordan has been Israel’s most vocal neighbor to condemn the annexation plans – and for good reason.

The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan shares a 335km land border with Israel and the occupied West Bank. The territory Israel plans to annex includes a 97km stretch of that land border in the Jordan Valley.

King Abdallah no doubt considers the annexation a direct threat to his own country’s security and entire existence. In previous Israeli- and US-led discussions about the so-called Deal of the Century, officials floated the idea of pushing exiled Palestinians from the West Bank into Jordan, effectively creating a defacto “Palestinian” state inside Jordan.

But it’s not the 1970s anymore and Jordan has minimal leverage. Resisting annexation by cancelling current peace agreements with Israel would put Amman at odds with Washington: Jordan’s single-largest financial supporter. The United States provides over $1 billion in assistance to Amman every year.

The Trump regime has shown it’s not afraid to cut off financial support to entities and organizations that don’t bend to US pressure. Just last month, Washington ended support for the World Health Organization, claiming the WHO was colluding with China in regard to COVID-19.

Taking a stand against Washington and Tel Aviv on annexation would likely force Jordan to commit entirely and realign its geopolitical allies.

Other neighbors have remained fairly mum about the whole thing.

Anyone waiting for Riyadh to wield their financial and political power shouldn’t hold their breath. Unsurprisingly, nothing but crickets has come out of Saudi Arabia.

On the contrary, Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has strengthened Riyadh’s diplomatic ties with Tel Aviv over the past few years, cooperated with Israel on matters of “security,” and implied it’s time to abandon the Palestinian cause.

It’s worth mentioning that dozens of Palestinian prisoners languish in Saudi jails for “terrorism” charges, proving Riyadh has no problem carrying out Israeli policy in its own land. Of course, there’s also the question of Yemen where Saudi Arabia takes notes directly out of Israel’s genocidal playbook.

An Arab League delegation consisting of officials from Oman, Kuwait, and Qatar met with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in early May to discuss their concern with Israel’s planned annexation. The Arab group released a statement condemning the annexation plans as illegal and detrimental to peace in the region.

For his part, UN Secretary-General Guterres said the annexation will end any potential two-state solution and future peace negotiations.

Egypt, another key Israeli ally and accomplice in many cases, expressed its disdain for Tel Aviv’s plans to annex the West Bank. However, Egyptian officials have not provided any potential response from Cairo should Israel follow through with the plans.

Like Jordan, Egypt’s hands are tied as it relies on the United States for financial assistance: Washington has provided Cairo with $70 billion in economic and military aid since 1980.

Over the past few decades, Washington has successfully kept Israel’s neighbors docile through financial support with political strings attached. While many neighboring countries have condemned Israel’s annexation plans, it’s hard to see a situation where any real action is taken.

European Union foreign ministers have discussed imposing sanctions against Israel if the Zionist entity completes the proposed annexation this summer. Such sanctions could result in the EU removing Israel from certain research programs and agreements.

While not all EU members support sanctions, the EU as a whole seems to agree that annexation is a step away from peace.Washington’s unwavering support for Israel – such as moving the embassy, tearing up the JCPOA, and now the so-called Deal of the Century – continues to put the US at odds with its western allies.

How will Palestinians respond?

The Israelis and their allies in Washington seem to underestimate the resilience of the Palestinian people.

A poll out of the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research found that a whopping 94% of Palestinians reject the plan. Meanwhile, 64% waging an armed struggle to resist implementing the so-called Deal of the Century, which involves annexation.

Even president of the Palestinian Authority, which colludes with Israeli security and effectively carries out Israeli repression in Gaza, condemned Israel’s annexation plans. In April, Mahmoud Abbas saidif the Zionist entity moves forward with annexation, “we will disengage from all commitments and agreements.”

Abbas Hamideh, founder of Al-Awda: The Palestine Right to Return Coalition, says the Zionist entity will go through with their West Bank annexation if the international community doesn’t step in to stop them:

“Unfortunately, Palestinians are limited in responding and cannot do much about it as they are powerless against the overwhelming Zionist occupier. Other than speaking out with their voice, there will be very little they can do.”

Annexation is anything but peaceful

Annexing any part of the West Bank is aggressive and violent on multiple levels. The United Nations has condemned Zionist settlements in the West Bank and declared them illegal on multiple occasions.

Under the so-called peace plan, these areas of the Jordan Valley flagged for annexation are rich in resources and prime locations for agricultural development. Kicking Palestinians out and telling them to make do with the rest would set up their state for failure.

The so-called Deal of the Century also demands that a future Palestinian state have no functioning airport or even military. What sovereign country isn’t “allowed” to have a military or even an airport?

If the Zionist entity moves forward with annexation, it will no doubt expel Palestinians violently from their homes, killing many in the process and forcing neighbors like Jordan and Lebanon to take in even more Palestinian refugees.

Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria are already housing thousands of Palestinians living in exile waiting to return to their homes – their right to return is guaranteed to them according to the Fourth Geneva Convention.

Following through with annexation is a violent and aggressive act – not only against Palestinians but also for Israel’s neighbors and European allies. It seems the US is the only entity supporting them openly at this point.

Many of the aid agencies operating in Yemen say the country is “really on the brink now,” Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), told a Friday briefing in Geneva.

“The situation is extremely alarming, they are talking about that the health system has in effect collapsed,” he said, quoting the aid agencies working in the war-torn state.

Laerke went on to say that aid workers have to turn people away because they say they do not have enough medical oxygen or sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment.

His comments came shortly after Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French acronym as MSF, said its main COVID-19 treatment center in southern Yemen has recorded at least 68 deaths in just two weeks.

“What we are seeing in our treatment center is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the number of people infected and dying in (Aden),” MSF’s operations manager for Yemen Caroline Seguin said Thursday.

The COVID-19 disease has further deteriorated the humanitarian situation in Yemen, where 80 percent of the population are reliant on international aid for survival.

Early this week, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warned that Yemen’s health system was already under heavy stress and would now be overwhelmed “if COVID-19 continues to spread.”

The so-called regime led by Yemen's former President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi in Aden has since April 10 announced 180 infections and 30 deaths from the coronavirus.

But the MSF said Thursday that its center in Aden had admitted 173 patients from April 30 to May 17, at least 68 of whom had lost their lives, suggesting “a wider catastrophe unfolding in the city.”

Since March 2015, Yemen has been heavily invaded by a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia, trying to restore power to Hadi.

Since March 2015, Yemen has been heavily invaded by a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia, trying to restore power to ex-Yemeni president Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi.

The Saudi coalition also aims to crush the popular Houthi Ansarullah movement, whose fighters have helped the Yemeni army defend the country against the invaders.

Ceaseless Saudi airstrikes and the destruction wrought by the kingdom's mercenaries and armed militia loyal to Hadi have wiped out much of Yemen’s infrastructure, destroying hospitals, schools, and factories.

Even so, inadequate testing capacity made it hard to pin down exact numbers but dying patients “clearly have the symptoms of COVID-19”, it said.

The MSF said endemic diseases like malaria and dengue “never produced so many deaths in such a short amount of time” in the Arab country.

“People are coming to us too late to save, and we know that many more people are not coming at all: they are just dying at home,” the medical charity further said.

""If our tankers in the Caribbean or anywhere in the world face trouble [caused] by the Americans, they (the US) will also be in trouble in kind,"" Rouhani said in a phone conversation with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani on Saturday.

He added that Iran attaches special significance to regional security and emphasized that some US measures in different parts of the world have led to ""unacceptable conditions"" but ""we will never initiate any tension or conflict at all.""

Iran reserves the legitimate right to defend its national sovereignty and territorial integrity and secure its own interests, Rouhani said, adding, ""We hope the Americans do not make a mistake.""

The Iranian president stressed the importance of strengthening joint cooperation amid the current coronavirus pandemic and said, ""However, the United States of America continues to make wrong decisions and keeps it inhumane approaches.""

He once again emphasized that regional security should be maintained by countries in the region, adding, ""We have always expressed our readiness for more cooperation with neighboring countries.""

According to Refinitiv Eikon tracking data, a flotilla of five tankers carrying Iranian fuel for Venezuela is approaching the Caribbean, with the first expected to reach the South American country’s waters on Sunday.

The shipments have infuriated the United States as both Iran and Venezuela are under US sanctions. Washington has threatened to take measures in response especially against Iran, according to a senior US official, who did not provide further details.

In a letter to United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres last week, Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif issued a stern warning against the provocative acts by the US which has dispatched its naval forces to the Caribbean Sea with the goal of disrupting the course of the Iranian tankers heading to Venezuela.

Zarif described ""the illegal, dangerous and provocative US threats [against the Iranian tankers]"" as a form of piracy and a big threat to international peace and security.

Venezuela's Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez said Wednesday that Caracas will send planes and ships to escort Iranian tankers arriving with fuel to the country in case of any US aggression.

He added that Venezuela's navy and air force will welcome the Iranian tankers bound for the Latin American country, seeing them through the nation's maritime territory and into port.

People attended the morning prayers of Eid Al Fitr at mosques that have reopened recently. Worshippers attended the prayers while taking the necessary precautionary measures.

Palestinians are celebrating Eid Al Fitr holiday differently this year due to worldwide coronavirus. However, people here say this won't prevent them from congratulating their families and celebrating Al Eid while following the instructions.

People in Gaza usually take the opportunity of Eid al-Fitr to wear new clothes, visit relatives, distribute sweets and traditional cookies. In this year however, they limited themselves to congratulating each other on the happy occasion.

As the holy month of Ramadan draws to an end, Palestinians in the blockaded Gaza Strip are preparing themselves to receive the Eid al-Fitr holiday under inhumane conditions.

People traditionally head to markets to buy new clothes, gifts and sweets for their families, but many here cannot afford to do that due to harsh economic conditions.

Most people have to shop for many hours trying to find affordable gifts for their loved ones.

Usually during festive occasions like Eid al-Fitr, sales are high in markets around the world, but in Gaza merchants complain about poor sales. For them it is one of the worst seasons they had in many years.

With this prayer, Muslims bid farewell to the fasting month of Ramadan and welcome one of the major festivities in Islam, Eid al-Fitr, or the festival of breaking the fast.

This year, however, the rows of the congregational prayers are arranged differently, with worshipers observing the safety distance amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Eid al-Fitr is associated with family visits, public celebrations and spending more time with the elderly.

Such traditions are mostly avoided this year, but there are other ways to catch up with relatives.

Eid al-Fitr is a culmination of one month of abstinence from eating and drinking, that's why Muslims consider it a reward for their month-long self-discipline and control over their diet.

Eid al-Fitr falls on the first day of the lunar month of Shawwal. The announcement of the festivity depends on the sighting of the new moon. Saudi Arabia, Egypt and some other countries observed the Eid a day earlier.

Barcelona may still be under a strict lockdown amidst the coronavirus pandemic, but a young drummer is out on a protest with the family nonetheless, and they want an end to the lockdown.

The protest, dubbed “Deconfining Rights and Freedoms,” was organized by a pro-independence group called the October 3 Platform. Koki Grassiot, one of the founders, says they have been organizing such rallies online during the lockdown. Their previous petitions to protest were turned down by the Spanish Ministry of the Interior for health reasons, until today.

Similar protests have kicked off across Spain in recent weeks, allegedly pushed by the conservatives and far right to bring down the left-leaning coalition executive.

For the first time in their history, International Quds Day events have gone online as a result of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic.

But according to organizers of Quds Day rallies, the forced cancellation of the annual events in Iran does not mean that Iranians have forgotten Palestinians at this important period of time.

To mark the occasion this year, applications have been made to stream messages from a wide array of community leaders, activists and public figures. In this campaign, all truth-seekers in Iran have been asked to choose an anti-Israel slogan, and then join an online rally on social media to show their support for Palestine.

International Quds Day is an annual event during which demonstrators express their solidarity with the Palestinian people and their opposition to the occupation of Palestinian territories by the Zionist regime of Israel.

The day is seen as the legacy of the late founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran Imam Khomeini who officially declared the last Friday of the holy month of Ramadan as International Quds Day back in 1979.

Spain, which imposed one of Europe's toughest lockdowns on March 14, has started to ease restrictions, but Madrid and Barcelona have remained in lockdown for longer because of more severe coronavirus outbreaks.

Protests against the lockdown started in Madrid's wealthy Salamanca neighbourhood last week, where people started banging pots and pans. But Saturday's procession marked the first organised protest against the government since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.

Vox urged people to protest in every regional capital, and similar car processions took place in Seville and Barcelona, among others.

Madrid and Barcelona are preparing to ease their lockdowns from Monday as infections have slowed. This will allow outdoor dining and gatherings of up to 10 people.

Alex and Matt from the llama farm ""Pembrokeshire Llamas"" decided to try and do something positive after their business was shut down by the virus. They've taken one of their llamas 'Max' to visit people living in remote spots while they deliver food to people and cheer them up.

""Shopping in the old days was miserable, wasn't it? It's great fun these days,"" said one of the customers in the video filmed by the farm owners on May 6.

According to the couple, llama delivery is not only eco-friendly but is most of all a safe alternative for those at risk of catching the virus, if they went out of the valley to shop.

Llama delivers food supplies several times a week, which helps Max stay in shape.
